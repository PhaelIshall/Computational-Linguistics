The seal around the tracheostomy is made with a newborn-size resuscitation mask, the hole of which is larger than the tracheal stoma. A sealing lubricant is applied to the soft rim of the mask and around the tracheostomy site, and adapters enable connection of the resuscitation mask and the large-bore PFT-equipment tubing. After affixing the adapters to the mask, we check that the seal is tight; if airleak is evident, more lubricant or a mask of different size or style may be necessary. Once a tight seal is achieved without airway compromise, the mask is attached to the PFT equipment and testing can begin. During testing, the patient should wear nose clips to prevent volume loss through the upper airway.
We tested this hypothesis in 30 mechanically ventilated adult patients with positive sputum cultures. We measured and compared the amount of bacteria present on an M-U catheter at the end of a 24-hour use period, the amount of bacteria present in the patient's sputum at that time, and the amount of bacteria present on a single-use (S-U) catheter at that time, after it had made one pass into the patient's airway. Organisms recovered and colony counts were also compared to results of a sputum culture obtained before the study began.
adenosine diphosphate induced human platelet aggregation was inhibited by gliclazide in high concentrations (0.5--2.0 mg/ml). In the same concentration range tolbutamide exhibited a slightly less pronounced inhibitory effect. Collagininduced human platelet aggregation was inhibited by gliclazide, glipizide and tolbutamide in a concentration range of 0.5--2.0 mg/ml. Gliclazide had a similar effect on rabbit platelets. In vivo studies: Both acute and seven days administration of gliclazide to rabbits resulted in prolonged primary and total hemostatic plug formation time both in arterioles and venules. Similar results were obtained with tolbutamide and glipizide. Experiments with laser-induced platelet plug formation in the rabbit ear chamber demonstrated that 100 mg gliclazide/kg body weight and 25 mg gliclazide/kg body weight during 7 days significantly reduced the number of platelet emboli formed during 10 minutes after laser injury.
Review of medical literature.
In this prospective series of 40 consecutive eyes we compared 20 eyes in 17 patients treated with combined phacoemulsification and glaucoma filtering surgery with the Ex-PRESS miniature glaucoma implant under a scleral flap with 20 matched control eyes in 20 patients who underwent combined cataract and glaucoma surgery with trabeculectomy.
A prospective study performed on a cohort of 37 patients undergoing cataract surgery by phacoemulsification with no intraoperative complications at the Hospital Cl√≠nico San Carlos, Madrid. After surgery, 19 of the patients were randomly assigned to receive topical 0.1% dexamethasone (DEX group) as inflammatory treatment and the remaining 18 subjects were treated with 1% rimexolone ( RIMEX group) following the same regime. Twenty four hours and one month after surgery, visual acuity, conjunctival hyperaemia, anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, intraocular pressure, corneal thickness and macular edema were determined in each patient.
The average RFNL thickness of patients who underwent cataract surgery was measured using the optical coherence tomography (OCT) III Stratus(R) before surgery, the day after and one month later. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 12.0 software. We used paired two tail student's t test for comparisons.

We have trained a powerful, state-of-the-art IE technology on a corpus of abstracts from the microbial literature in PubMed to automatically identify and categorize biologically relevant entities and predicative relations. These relations include: Genes/Gene Products and their Roles; Gene Mutations and the resulting Phenotypes; and Organisms and their associated Pathogenicity. Evaluations on blind datasets show an F-measure average of greater than 90% for entities (genes, operons, etc.) and over 70% for relations (gene/gene product to role, etc). This IE capability, combined with text indexing and relational database technologies, constitute the core of our recently deployed text mining application.
Tumor tissue from HCC patients with (n = 43) and without (n = 138) bone metastasis was subjected to immunohistochemical staining for CXCR4 using tissue microarrays. Immunoreactivity was evaluated semi-quantitatively.

Patient survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.
A CRCT is developed using a Solomon four-group design (two intervention and two control groups) to evaluate the effects of using the SIPP. Radiotherapists, instead of cancer patients, are randomly allocated to the experimental or control groups. Within these groups, all included cancer patients are randomised into two subgroups: with and without pre-measurement. Self-reported assessments are conducted at four times: a pre-test at baseline before the first consultation and a post-test directly following the first consultation, and three and 12 months after baseline measurement. The primary outcome measures are the number and types of referrals of cancer patients with psychosocial problems to relevant (psychosocial) caregivers. The secondary outcome measures are patients' satisfaction with the radiotherapist-patient communication, psychosocial distress and quality of life. Furthermore, a process evaluation will be carried out. Data of the effect-evaluation will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle and data regarding the types of referrals to health care providers and patient satisfaction about the with radiotherapists will be analysed by means of descriptive techniques. The process evaluation data will also be analysed by means of descriptive techniques.

The Quick Identification of acute Chest pain Study (QICS) will investigate whether a combined use of specific symptoms and signs, electrocardiography, routine and new laboratory measures, adjunctive imaging including electron beam (EBT) computed tomography (CT) and contrast multislice CT (MSCT) will have a high diagnostic yield for patients with acute chest pain. All patients will be investigated according a standardized protocol in the Emergency Department. Serum and plasma will be frozen for future analysis for a wide range of biomarkers at a later time point. The primary endpoint is the safe recognition of low-risk chest pain patients directly at presentation. Secondary endpoint is the identification of a wide range of sensitive predictive clinical markers, chemical biomarkers and radiological markers in acute chest pain patients. Chemical biomarkers will be compared to quantitative CT measurements of coronary atherosclerosis as a surrogate endpoint. Chemical biomarkers will also be compared in head to head comparison and for their additional value.

A group of 11 chiropractors were selected because they used maintenance care. They were interviewed using the questionnaire from the previous Swedish survey. The questionnaire consisted of a simple description of a hypothetical patient with low back pain and nine possible ways in which the case could develop ("scenarios"). They could choose between six different management strategies for each scenario. In addition, the chiropractors were encouraged to provide their own definition of maintenance care in an open-ended question. Interviews were taped, transcribed and analyzed. For the open-ended question, statements were identified relating to six pre hoc defined topics on the inclusion criteria/rationale for maintenance care, the frequency of treatments, and the duration of the maintenance care program.
The pharmacokinetics of valganciclovir were described with plasma concentrations from 22 patients (age range 3-17 years) using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) software. A two-compartment model with lag-time and first-order absorption and elimination was developed. The final model was validated using a bootstrap and visual predictive check. The dosage regimens of valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis in children were simulated using the final model.
The CAESAR study, a prospective 12-month study in primary renal allograft recipients, was designed to determine whether mycophenolate mofetil-based regimens containing either low-dose cyclosporin or low-dose cyclosporin withdrawn by 6 months could minimize nephrotoxicity and improve renal function without an increase in acute rejection compared with a mycophenolate mofetil-based regimen containing standard-dose cyclosporin.
A subset of patients from the CAESAR study contributed to this pharmacokinetic analysis of MPA exposure. Blood samples were taken over one dosing interval on day 7 and at months 3, 7 and 12 post-transplantation. The sampling time points were predose, 20, 40 and 75 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after mycophenolate mofetil dosing. Assessments included plasma concentrations of MPA and mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and cyclosporin trough concentrations. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 hours (AUC(12)) for MPA was the primary pharmacokinetic parameter, and the AUC(12) for MPAG was the secondary parameter.
Stable-labelled carbamazepine was administered intravenously on three occasions during the deinduction period to 15 patients with epilepsy for whom carbamazepine therapy was being discontinued.

Rat MSC were isolated from the BM of the four different rat strains in an identical fashion. Cells were characterized for their cell-surface phenotype in early and late passage. Functional mesenchymal differentiation capacities were examined following adipogenic and osteogenic inductions. Population doubling times were determined across the four strains throughout 10 passages. In vitro proliferation assays of immune cells were conducted following co-culture of spleen cells and MSC of the four different strains.
We studied the use of placental-derived adherent stromal cells (ASC) in a standard limb ischemia model of male Balb/c mice. These placental-derived cells, termed PLX-PAD, share the adherence and marker expression of BM-derived MSC but lack their differentiation potential. PLX-PAD are isolated from human placenta following a Caesarean section and cultured in a bioreactor, termed the PluriX System. The PluriX System provides a three-dimensional (3-D) microenvironment that enables the large-scale growth of these cells. PLX-PAD are stable adhesive cells that can be expanded in vitro without the loss of phenotype and without showing signs of karyotypic changes.

Each tooth was cut in half. A longitudinal section 200 mum in thickness was subjected to the determination of the heavy metal content by SRXRF or conventional analytical methods (ICP-MS analysis or reduction-aeration atomic absorption spectrometry). The relative concentrations of Pb, Hg, Cu and Zn measured by SRXRF were translated in concentrations (in g of heavy metal/g of enamel) using calibration curves by the two analytical methods.
We measured personal exposure to PM(2.5) and examined oxidative stress using urinary malondialdehyde three times in 51 preschoolers and 38 elderly subjects. A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate PM(2.5) effects on urinary MDA levels.
A total of 75 milk samples were obtained within 1 month of delivery from Japanese mothers living in the coastal areas of the Japan Sea. The relationships between the levels of seven dioxins and ten furan isomers in maternal breast milk, measured by high-resolution-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the birth size of newborns, which is related to fetal growth, were investigated after adjustment for confounding factors.
The reproduction number for airborne infection in an enclosed space (R (A)) was estimated using a Wells-Riley model. First, we estimated R (A) for the TB infection based on the report of the TB outbreak in the Internet caf√©. Second, TB infectious dose, number of days of exposure, and air-exchange rate in the facility were varied to estimate the effect of TB risk settings and environmental factors.
Subjects were 232 infants (111 males and 121 females) aged 1.6 and 3 years born in "N" town between the fiscal years of 1997 and 2001. Infants aged 1.6 and 3 years had 99.6 and 100% participation in health checkups, respectively. Of the total, 148 and 84 infants were living in the urban and rural areas, respectively, of "N" town.
The validation study was performed using 116 non-handicapped community-dwelling Japanese elderly at least 60 years of age. Of those subjects, 44 were also analyzed for the relationship between baseline ADL status and subsequent risk of adverse conditions related to falls.
Thirty-two subjects (17 males and 15 females) volunteered for the study. They were classified into three groups: intervention group 1, comprised of first grade physical therapist students; control group, which included first grade occupational therapist students; intervention group 2, which comprised third grade physical therapist students. The educational intervention during the experimental period consisted of: (1) 12 regular classes and short-term clinical practice for the students of intervention group 1; (2) long-term clinical practice, relating to patient-handling task, for the students of intervention group 2. The following experiments were repeated before and after the educational intervention. Each subject was asked to transfer a male (55 kg) from one chair to a second chair (left to right) and then back again to the original chair (right to left). The flexion angles of the trunk, hip and knee joints were quantified by means of the dynamic three-dimensional biomechanical analysis. Muscle activities (% maximum voluntary contraction, %MVC) of biceps brachii, trapezius, rectus femoris and erector spinae muscles were measured using surface electromyography (EMG). The effects of group, gender, measurement time and side on joint angles of trunk and lower extremity, %MVC of four muscle activities and transfer time were assessed.
Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Study conducted in 2002 and 2005, 8,099 surviving and 3,822 deceased elderly aged 65 years and over were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression.
This was a population-based cross-sectional, case-control study. Cases were selected among students of a primary and junior high school, respectively, and age- and sex-matched control subjects were selected randomly (ratio of cases to control subject was 37:113).
A questionnaire survey was performed to evaluate the estimated prevalence of ADHD symptoms in preschool children in Niigata City, Japan. The first survey, conducted in 2003, involved an evaluation of ADHD symptoms by their school teachers. The second survey, conducted in 2006, involved an evaluation of the symptoms by parents. The teacher survey included 9,956 children, and the parent survey included 7,566 children. Parents and teachers assessed ADHD symptoms in children using a 14-item questionnaire based on DSM-III-R. Children with a score of 8 or higher were classified as having ADHD symptoms.
We used checkup data compiled for 6477 male workers, aged 20-59 years in 1995, with risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The relation between the recovery from risk factors 9 years later and baseline lifestyles was examined by logistic regression according to the initial number of risk factors.
A total of 535 residents (184 men and 351 women) who attended a healthcare checkup program conducted in a rural area of Hokkaido, Japan, in August 2005 provided informed consent for their spot urine samples to be used for the determination of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) levels. They also completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding the intake frequency of 12 food items. The concentrations of creatinine-corrected 3-PBA were predicted by the intake frequency of each item, using analysis-of-covariance models to adjust for age, sex, body mass index, and drinking and smoking status.
We analyzed nine metabolites (MMP, MEP, MnBP, MBzP, MEHP, MEOHP, MEHHP, MINP, MnOP) of seven phthalate esters in spot urine samples from 50 pregnant women by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Using four urine samples collected from each of 12 subjects from 50 pregnant women within 5-12 weeks, we compared intra- and interindividual variation in urinary metabolites by calculation of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We estimated daily intakes of 50 pregnant women from their urinary metabolite concentrations.
The subjects were 54 HF patients (six men, 48 women; mean age: 78.0 +/- 8.4 years) admitted to general hospitals in Hirosaki, Aomori prefecture, between 1998 and 2007. All were aged 60 years or older and were able to walk immediately before injury; physical therapy was initiated for all individuals during hospitalization. Evaluation items related to physical function, psychological function, and complications that may affect gait were evaluated; these included the manual muscle test, motor age test, Katz's index, dementia (HDS-R), consciousness disturbance, among others.
Two regions with an objectively assessed high and low residential density, land use mix-diversity, and street connectivity, respectively, were identified in one city. The subjects were selected using a stratified random sampling method by sex and age in each region. The NE of the subjects was objectively measured using the Geographic Information System (GIS), and the subjects' perception of the NE was assessed using a questionnaire. The daily total number of walking steps was measured with an accelerometer, and walking and cycling time were assessed by a questionnaire.
The PPCPs were selected on the basis of consumption at the regional scale, reported aquatic toxicity, and the suitability of the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method for the determination of the compounds at trace levels. The studied PPCPs, caffeine (stimulant), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), pentoxifylline (anticoagulant), cyclophosphamide (cytostatic), ibuprofen (analgesic), and galaxolide (musk fragrance), were determined in samples of the Somes River. The analytes were enriched by solid-phase extraction and subsequently determined by GC/MS. Caffeine, pentoxifylline, and galaxolide were determined underivatized, whereas the acidic pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, and ibuprofen were determined after derivatization with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide.
Although based on a pre-existing water resources management system developed in Switzerland, the methodological approach applied to develop a GIS-based water quality management system adapted to the Romanian context followed a set of well-defined steps: the first and very important step is the assessment of needs (on the basis of a careful analysis of the various activities and missions of the water administration and other relevant stakeholders in water management related issues). On that basis, a conceptual data model (CDM) can be developed, to be later on turned into a physical database. Finally, the specifically requested additional functionalities (i.e. functionalities not provided by classical commercial GIS software), also identified during the assessment of needs, are developed. This methodology was applied, on an experimental basin, in the Ialomita River basin.
Water, soil, and atmospheric deposition samples were collected from different locations within 3 km from the industrial area. For comparison, samples were also taken from Bucharest. Water samples were filtered (&lt;0.45 microm), extracted by salpetric acid, and quantified by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Soil samples were dried, sieved (&lt;2 mm), extracted by aqua regia and analyzed by AAS. In order to quantify the atmospheric deposition, three kinds of permanently open collecting pots were used on nine different sites between August and November 2006.
The small Certej catchment, situated in the Southern Apuseni Mountains, covers an area of 78 km(2). About 4,500 inhabitants are living in the basin, in which metal mining was the main economic sector. An open pit and several abandoned underground mines are producing heavy metal-loaded acidic water that is discharged untreated into the main river. The solid wastes of mineral processing plants were deposited in several dumps and tailings impoundment embodying the acidic water-producing mineral pyrite.
The natural science team collected samples from surface waters, drinking water from dug wells and from groundwater. Filtered and total heavy metals, both after enrichment, and major cations were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Major anions in waters, measured by ion chromatography, alkalinity and acidity were determined by titration. Solid samples were taken from river sediments and from the largest tailings dam. The latter were characterised by X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. Heavy metals in sediments were analysed after digestion. Simultaneously, the socioeconomic team performed a household survey to evaluate the perception of people related to the river and drinking water pollution by way of a logistic regression analysis.
Drinking water samples were collected from different sampling points in the water treatment plant (WTP) from Gilau and the corresponding distribution system in Cluj-Napoca and also from Beclean, Dej and Jibou WTPs. The water samples were collected once a month from July 2006 to November 2007 and stored in 40-mL vials closed with Teflon lined screw caps. Water samples were preserved at 4 degrees C until analysis after sodium thiosulfate (Na(2)S(2)O(3)) had been added to quench residual chlorine. All samples were analysed for THMs using headspace GC-ECD between 1 and 7 days after sampling. The sample (10 mL) was filled into 20-mL headspace vials and closed with a Teflon-lined screw cap. Thereafter, the samples were equilibrated in an oven at 60 degrees C for 45 min. The headspace (1 mL) was then injected into the GC (Cyanopropylphenyl Polysiloxane column, 30 m x 53 mm, 3 microm film thickness, Thermo Finnigan, USA). The MDLs for THMs were determined from the standard deviation of eight standards at 1 microg/L. The MDLs for CHCl(3), CHBrCl(2), CHBr(2)Cl and CHBr(3) were 0.3, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.6 microg/L, respectively. All kinetic laboratory studies were carried out only with water from the WTP Gilau. The experiments were conducted under two conditions: baseline conditions (pH 7, 21 degrees C, 2.5 mg/L Cl(2)) to gain information about the change of the organic matter in the raw water and seasonally variable conditions to simulate the actual process at the treatment plant and the distribution system.
The survey was carried out at six main sample sites along the Bahlui River. Sediments were chemically analysed for their content in polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) isomers and the dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) family. River water was biologically monitored at the level of phytoplankton and benthic invertebrates' communities. Water samples from six locations have been analyzed for algal species composition and correspondence to various water quality indices. Biological samples have been taken from the same locations so as to calculate the macroinvertebrate indices. In the most polluted areas, as revealed by previous methods, toxicity was tested by exposing the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the cladoceran Daphnia magna to various dilutions of water sample.
The aims and scopes of different directives are compiled and compared with the actual quality of water, different approaches of standard settings are compared and potential treatment options are discussed.
A stratified probability proportionate to size cluster sampling method was used to obtain a representative national sample of school-age children from 30 clusters. Spot urine samples were collected for UIC analysis using a modified Sandell-Kolthoff method.
We used 24-h recall data from 10 851 adults, aged 19 years and over, who participated in the nationally representative 1995 National Nutrition Survey. 'Extra' foods were defined using principles outlined in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and by applying cut points for maximum amounts of fat and sugar within each food category.
Anthropometric measurements and CT scans were performed in 74 obese subjects. Fat thicknesses, diameters, diagonals and areas were determined. Plasma lipids, insulin, glucose and fat cell size were analyzed. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the most accurate predictor index for metabolic alterations explaining the highest percentage of variance.
Subjects (n=12) consumed a high and a low GI diet in a randomized, crossover design, consisting of four meals that were matched for macronutrients and fibre, and differed only in carbohydrate quality (GI). Blood was sampled every 30-60 min and assayed for glucose, insulin, CCK and GHR.

Twenty-one studies, which enrolled a total of 1030 and 687 subjects receiving psyllium or placebo, respectively, were included in the meta-analysis. The studies were randomized placebo-controlled trials, double blinded or open label, on subjects with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. The dose of psyllium was between 3.0 and 20.4 g per day and intervention period was more than 2 weeks. Any type of diet background was permitted. Diet lead-in period was between 0 and 8 weeks.
This study enrolled 100 healthy young adults aged 18-34 years. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements and lifestyle features were analyzed. Fasting blood samples were collected for the measurement of glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols and C3 concentrations. Nail samples were collected for the analysis of selenium concentrations.
Nutrient profiles tested were composed of positive subscores based on nutrients to encourage and negative subscores based on nutrients to limit. Alternative profiles, computed using different bases of calculation, were used to rank order 378 commonly consumed foods from a food frequency instrument. Profile performance was tested with respect to the foods' energy density.
Skinfold thicknesses and bioimpedance analysis (whole body and limbs) were evaluated in three groups of underweight patients (30 patients with anorexia nervosa, 10 constitutionally lean individuals and 15 classical dancers) and 30 normal weight controls.
In 31 healthy children, weight, height, circumferences, skinfolds, DEXA, abdominal ultrasound and CT were performed. Measurements were compared by simple correlations and receiver operating characteristic analyses.
A double-blind controlled clinical trial was carried out, in which 112 subjects with hypertriglyceridemia were randomly divided into two dietary oil groups: (1) long-chain triacylglycerol (LCT) and (2) MLCT. All subjects were requested to ingest fixed energy and to continue their normal activity levels, and to consume LCT or MLCT oil at 25-30 g daily during the study period. Anthropometric measurements of body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat, body fat percentage, waist and hip circumference (WC and HC), areas of subcutaneous and visceral fat by computed tomography scanning and blood biochemical markers were measured at the beginning and end of the study.
We analyzed data from a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00156832) of prophylactic micronutrient supplementation to children aged 6-24 months. Three cohorts of children: 32 HIV-infected children, 154 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers and 187 uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers, received vitamin A, vitamin A plus zinc or multiple micronutrients, which included vitamin A and zinc. The main outcome was incidence of diarrhoea. Poisson regression was used in intent-to-treat analyses. Stratified analyses followed testing for statistical interaction between intervention and stunting.
The study was conducted on a paediatric group of 71 oral breathers selected at the Allergology and Paediatric Immunology Department of Umberto I General Hospital, University of Rome "La Sapienza" (Italy). The children were selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Children aged 6 to 12 years with no history of craniofacial malformations or orthodontic treatment were included. The results were compared with a control group composed of 71 patient aged 6 to 12 years with nasal breathing. After their medical history was recorded, all patients underwent orthodontic/otolaryngological clinical examinations. The following diagnostic procedures were then performed: latero-lateral projection teleradiography, orthopantomogram, dental impressions, anterior rhinomanometry before and after administering a local vasoconstrictor, nocturnal home pulse oximetry (NHPO) recording, spirometry test, skin prick test, study cast evaluation and cephalometric analysis following Tweed's principles. The intraoral examination assessed: dental class type, overbite, overjet, midlines, crossbite, and presence of parafunctional oral habits such as atypical swallowing, labial incompetence, finger sucking and sucking of the inner lip. Evaluation of the study casts involved arch perimeter and transpalatal width assessment, and space analysis.
Observational study.
A group of 54 CF patients, aged 7 to 12 years, was selected and their data were compared to those of the same age healthy control group of 101 children.
A cross-sectional study was carried out at the school premises.
For this survey, 502 subjects attending 6 different schools in the city of Isfahan, Iran (253 females and 249 males, aged 11-14 years) were randomly selected and examined, including those who were wearing an orthodontic appliance at the time of the survey (1 female and 5 males). IOTN (DHC and AC) scores were recorded for those who were not undergoing orthodontic treatment. One examiner, who had been formally calibrated in the use of occlusal indices, screened all schoolchildren. IOTN scores was calculated from direct examination. Gender dimorphism was evaluated by the Chi-square test (AC and DHC components of IOTN index). The prevalence of most severe occlusal traits in those who scored DHC 4 and 5 was calculated.
Sixty primary incisors were divided into 6 groups according to the adhesive system (etch-and-rinse - Adper Single Bond 2 - SB, 2 steps self-etch -Clearfil SE Bond - SE, and 1 step self-etch - One Up Bond F Plus OBF) and to the substrate (ground or intact enamel): G1-SB/intact enamel; G2-SE/intact enamel; G3- OBF/intact enamel; G4-SB/ground enamel; G5- SE/ground enamel and G6-OBF/ground enamel.
Microshear bond test specimens were prepared with microhybrid composite and after 24h of water storage the microshear test was performed.

Dental developmental delay was compared between 40 UCLP patients (20 boys and 20 girls, average age 9.6 +/- 2.7 years) and 40 BCLP patients matched by sex and age (to the nearest 6 months). For the purpose of comparison, a total of 80 panoramic radiographs of unaffected group matching in age and sex were selected randomly.
Using panoramic radiographs, the seven left mandibular permanent teeth, second molar to central incisor, were rated on eight stage scales using the methods described by Demirjian et al. [1973]. The stage of each tooth was converted to the corresponding numeric value, and then all values were added to obtain a dental maturity score, which corresponded to a dental age.
The differences in developmental delay between the two cleft groups were determined using independent t-test.
A case of a 9.6-year-old female with monocondylar and intracapsular fracture following a car accident is described. In accordance with the literature, the patient did not undergo surgical treatment, but followed a functional orthodontic protocol. The significant symptoms reduction and the rapid improvement of mandibular functions confirm the excellent healing potential in paediatric age, while the X-ray evaluations 1 year and 3.7 years later testify the condylar reshaping. Since the latter can continue over many years, the clinical and radiological follow-ups of the patient will have to cover the entire growth period.
We presented one case of en bloc resection of the carotid artery with reconstruction with superficial femoral artery transplantation.
The expression of cyclin A and E was investigated in the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of 71 patients (53 men and 18 women; age 59.27+/-8.50 years), using a monoclonal antibodies to cyclin A and to cyclin E.

A maximum of 10 s was allowed for blood collection.
Fifty-four sport and physical education students were randomly allocated to one of two training groups (combined uphill-downhill [U+D] and horizontal (H)) and a control group (C). Pre- and posttraining tests were performed to examine the effects of 8 wk of training on the maximum running speed (MRS), step rate, step length, step time, contact time, eccentric and concentric phase of contact time (EP, CP), flight time, selected posture characteristics of the step cycle, and 6-s maximal cycle sprint test.
Following determination of 1-rep maximum in single-leg leg extension, 15 males performed reps to failure at 60% 1-RM in 3 conditions: control, perceived caffeine condition, and perceived placebo condition presented in a randomized order. Participants were informed they would ingest 250 mL of solution that contained either 3 mg.kg(-1) caffeine or 3 mg.kg(-1) placebo 1 h before each exercise trial. A deceptive protocol was employed and subjects consumed a placebo solution in both conditions. During each condition, total reps, RPE for the active muscle and overall body, and PHR were recorded.
Seven youth male and six female team-sport athletes performed two sessions separated by 7 d, involving a 30-min exercise protocol and 60-min passive recovery in either 22 degrees C or 33 degrees C and 40% relative humidity. The exercise protocol involved a 20-s maximal sprint every 5 min, separated by constant-intensity exercise at 100 W on a cycle ergometer. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and a resting evoked twitch (Pf) of the right knee extensors were assessed before and immediately following exercise and again 15, 30, and 60 min postexercise, and capillary blood was obtained at the same time points to measure lactate, pH, and HCO3. During and following exercise, core temperature, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were also measured.

Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, crossover field trial.
167 Thoroughbred racehorses.
Horses were allocated to race fields of 9 to 16 horses each and raced twice, 1 week apart, with each of the 2 races consisting of the same race field and distance. Each horse received furosemide (500 mg, IV) before one race and a placebo (saline solution) before the other, with the order of treatments randomly determined. Severity of EIPH was scored on a scale from 0 to 4 after each race by means of tracheobronchoscopy. Data were analyzed by means of various methods of multivariable logistic regression.
Cross-sectional study.
Animal shelters across the United States in which euthanasia was conducted (5 to 100 employees/shelter).
With the assistance of experts associated with the Humane Society of the United States, the authors identified 88 animal shelters throughout the United States in which animal euthanasia was actively conducted and for which contact information regarding the shelter director was available. Staff at 62 animal shelters agreed to participate in the survey. Survey packets were mailed to the 62 shelter directors, who then distributed them to employees. The survey included questions regarding respondent age, level of education, and role and asked those directly involved in the euthanasia of animals to provide advice on strategies for new euthanasia technicians to deal with the related stress. Employees completed the survey and returned it by mail. Content analysis techniques were used to summarize survey responses.
Clinical samples were collected from diabetic patients in hospitals throughout Saudi Arabia from December 2006 to April 2007. API 20 Ne, polymorphisms in the 16S-23S-rRNA intergenic region and the presence of a bla( OXA-51-like )gene were all used for identification. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfGe) coupled with sequence analysis of the bla(OXA-51-like )genes were used for strain characterization. Polymerase chain reaction (pCR) and multiplex pCR were used to screen for the presence and location of ISAba1 elements and bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), and bla(OXA-58-like )genes respectively.
BCRP expression was verified by immunostaining and Western blots in intact porcine brain capillaries, isolated endothelial cells (PBCECs) and in MDCKII-cells over-expressing human wild-type BCRP (MDCKII-hBCRP). Transport of fluorescent mitoxantrone across cells was determined to assess a preferred transport direction. Sensitivity of cultured cells versus mitoxantrone in the absence and in the presence of transport modulators was examined at increasing concentrations of the cytostatic using the AlamarBlue assay. In addition, cells were incubated with mitoxantrone in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of different compounds with the potential to interact with BCRP. Intracellular fluorescence accumulation was measured using a flow cytometer.
A total of 362 patients who were compliant with preparation instructions were enrolled. All colonoscopic examinations were performed by an experienced endoscopist and the quality of the preparation was graded by the endoscopist (excellent to poor). Patient demographic and medical history information was gathered before the procedure. Possible predictors of inadequate colonic preparation were analyzed using univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression models.
An electronic survey was developed and administered to all gastroenterologists and hepatologists [gastroenterologists (GI) group] and a sampling of nonprocedure-oriented internal medicine specialists and subspecialists (non-GI group) employed by Mayo Clinic. The questionnaire assessed several areas including current or past pain injury associated with performing endoscopy, location and description of pain or injury, impact of pain or injury, and prevention strategies. A modified survey was sent to the control group.
Subjects without anal abnormalities and patients with anal disease (abscesses, fistulas) were evaluated.
This study enrolled 1187 patients, including controls, those with gastric cancer (GC), benign gastric ulcer (BGU), and duodenal ulcer patients. Six polymorphisms were genotyped, 3 of IL-10 (at -592, -819, and -1082), 1 of IL-8 (at -251), and 2 of IL-6 (at -174 and -572), by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
In this prospective study, 236 obese children (age: 7 to 16 y) were interviewed using a standard questionnaire for reflux symptoms and a reflux symptom score was calculated. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than 95th percentile for age and sex. One hundred and one age-matched and sex-matched children with BMI between 5th and 95th percentile served as controls. Demographic data were collected in all children. We compared prevalence rates of a reflux symptom score and other symptoms between the 2 groups.
A nonrandomized, prospective observational study of adjusted-dose combination therapy. Twenty patients were enrolled and began pegylated interferon at 135 microg/wk SC, and 4 weeks later ribavirin was started at 200 mg PO weekly, increasing gradually to 3 times a week for a total of 48 weeks.
Between March 2002 and December 2005, PTVE was attempted in 92 patients with esophageal varices, 74 patients with recent variceal bleeding, 18 patients with acute variceal bleeding. The 2-OCA was injected into the entire lower esophageal and periesophageal or paraesophageal varices, the cardial submucosal, and perforating vessels.
Thirty-seven patients with asthma (19) and chronic cough (18) were recruited from the respiratory clinic. Reflux was monitored using a combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH probe by detecting (1) bolus reflux episodes within the esophagus and in the pharynx and (2) acidic reflux episodes within the esophagus and in the pharynx. All acid suppressive therapy was stopped for at least 7 days before the study. Demonstration of cough being linked to reflux was achieved using the symptom association probability (SAP). This was calculated using a 2-minute association window between symptoms and bolus entry into the esophagus. SAP was considered positive if &gt;95%.
Patients (n=126) were divided into 4 groups according to median levels of AFP and PIVKA-II (L; low/low, A; high/low, P; low/high, H; high/high) at diagnosis. Clinical characteristics and survival were compared among the groups, and Cox regression analysis was performed to find independent factors for survival.
We genotyped 1028 IBD patients, including 443 CD and 347 ulcerative colitis (UC) non-Jewish cases, 238 (183 CD and 55 UC) Jewish cases, and 1005 ethnically matched control subjects for 18 and 11 variants, respectively, in the IL-23R and ATG16L1 genes, including the IL-23R (R381Q) and ATG16L1 (T216A) variants, previously associated with CD.
A prospective analysis of intraoperative bile duct cultures in patients undergoing surgery for both, malignant or benign periampullary diseases at the Department of Surgery, St Josef Hospital, Bochum, Germany, during a period of 18 months, between January 2004 and June 2005.
In all patients with a hepaticojejunostomy (n=80), a bile duct culture was collected during the operation. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis perioperatively and a retrograde flushing of bile ducts with warm saline after bile duct resection. Fifty-one percent (41/80) patients had biliary drainage before surgery, whereas 49% (39/80) were operated without preoperative draining procedures.
Eighty-four adult volunteers, actively experiencing pain, participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. All patients received standard IANB of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. Twenty-four patients did not receive supplemental infiltrations (control). Thirty patients received supplemental buccal and lingual infiltrations of 2% articaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, and 30 patients received buccal and lingual infiltrations of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine at 2 minutes after the IANB. Endodontic access preparation was initiated after 15 minutes of initial IANB. Pain during treatment was recorded by using a Heft Parker visual analog scale. Success was recorded as "none" or "mild" pain.
The study began with targeted electronic searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane databases, followed with exhaustive hand searching and citation mining for all articles reporting clinical and/or radiographic outcomes for at least a mean follow-up of 2 years for these procedures. Pooled and weighted success rates were determined from a meta-analysis of the data abstracted from the articles.
A total of 225 maxillary and mandibular first and second permanent molars endodontically treated by undergraduate or postgraduate students were randomly selected from a computerized hospital database of which 110 molars had been prepared using a hybrid rotary technique with nickel-titanium instruments (group NR) and 115 with hand stainless steel files (group HF). Patients were recalled and the teeth were examined both clinically and radiographically for signs of periapical inflammation.
We searched a database of 23,000 small-volume cone beam computed tomography scans and evaluated the first 200 patients that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age between 30-69 years; (2) known gender (n = 25 males and 25 females for each 10-year age bin); and (3) scans containing the mandibular first molar and IAN. Exclusion criteria consisted of any pathosis that might alter the position of the IAN. Anatomic measurements were made by 2 observers with mutual agreement of any discordant measures. Fourteen measurements (in millimeters) were taken at the level of the IAN and mesial and distal root apices. Data were analyzed by 2-way (age, sex) analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test at P &lt;.05.
Thirty-four adult patients who presented for apicoectomy of persistent periradicular lesions after endodontic therapy were selected for the study and samples of periradicular tissue and resected root ends collected. Total bacterial levels were estimated for 34 paired periradicular lesions and root ends using real-time polymerase chain reaction with universal bacterial primers. Sixteen pairs of these samples were analyzed using ribosomal 16S cloning and sequencing for bacterial identification.
Of 271 patients who had chronic persistent pain that did not respond to previous endodontic procedures and were referred to the Endodontic Team of the Nippon Dental University Hospital, 16 patients (5.9%; mean age, 46.8 years; 13 women) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for NTP were recruited. The inclusion criteria for the patients were the presence of chronic persistent pain and other pain-related symptoms, despite the absence of major pathology.
Twenty-eight teeth had their WLs determined with each electronic apex locator (EAL) by using 0.04 taper ProFiles sizes 40-20 in a crown-down technique until WL was reached. Four control teeth had their WL determined by using stainless steel hand files. The files were cemented at WL, and the teeth were extracted. The apical 4 mm of each root was shaved to the apical constriction, exposing the file. Photographs were taken under 15x and 30x magnification and projected at 360x and 720x for evaluation.
A written survey was developed and mailed to 1505 randomly selected practicing endodontists within the United States.
Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed cervical dentin hypersensitive teeth were included and randomly allocated to either the application of fluoride varnish (group fluoride) or Nd:YAG laser (100 mJ, 20 Hz; group Nd:YAG). The assessment of pain and discomfort was performed by a visual analog scale after an air blast at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at patient visits on weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were used as a model because they lack an adaptive immune response. The expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in experimentally inflamed pulps in SCID mice was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Total RNA was isolated from pulp tissues at 0 to 24 hours after bacterial dentinal infection. Anti-TLR-2, anti-TLR-4 cells, anti-CD64, and antinestin cells were detected with labeled streptavidin-biotin methods.
Collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (C-HA) and uncoated hydroxyapatite (HA) disks were inoculated with dispersed subgingival plaque for 3 weeks. Thick biofilms rich in spirochetes were formed on both substrates. Biofilms were subjected to 1-, 3-, and 10-minute exposures to CHX-Plus (Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI) and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX). After treatment, the volume ratio of dead bacteria to all bacteria in biofilms, indicated by the ratio of red and (red + green) fluorescence, was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy for each medicament.
Saliva that was tested to be free of E. faecalis was used as the inoculum. The fate of E. faecalis was examined by using culture techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
In cultured cells, MAP-1B expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and Western blot. Its distribution was visualized by in situ hybridization and immunochemistry both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of FMRP, MAP2, and tau was identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunochemistry.
MDPC-23 cells were exposed to 100 ng/mL Escherichia coli LPS, and artificial wounds were induced in the right first molar of the maxillary of rats. In addition, a morphological change in the MDPC-23 cells was observed after LPS treatment. MDPC-23 cells were transfected transiently with the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) promoter binding vector.
Forty-four extracted mandibular second molars with C-shaped roots were collected from a Chinese population. Size 10 or 15 K files were used to explore the canal orifices when viewed under the surgical operating microscope. Choices in the number and position of the files inserted into the canal system were based on the different orifice shape. After the teeth with files were scanned and reconstructed, the number and position of the files were analyzed.
The periapex of 83 treated or untreated roots of dogs' teeth was examined using periapical radiography (PR), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, and histology. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and accuracy of PR and CBCT diagnosis were calculated.
ProTaper Universal instruments F3 and F4 (Maillefer SA, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were used in an artificial curved canal under rotational speeds of 300 rpm or 600 rpm. The artificial canal was made of stainless steel, with an inner diameter of 1.5 mm, total length of 20 mm, and arc at the end with a curvature radius of 6 mm. The arc length was 9.4 mm and 10.6 mm on the straight part. The number of cycles required to fracture was recorded. Fractured surfaces and the helical shafts of the fractured instruments were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy.
Sixty-four extracted human teeth were used, with 2 teeth each as positive and negative controls. Endodontic access with a mesio-occluso-distal cavity was prepared. Palatal cusps of maxillary molars and buccal cusps of mandibular molars were removed. Cotton was placed over the canals and covered with Cavit. Thirty teeth were restored with Ketac Silver (KS) and 30 with KS reinforced with a stainless steel band (KSSB). Samples were submersed in India ink mixed with brain heart infusion broth containing Streptococcus gordonii. After 3 months of simulated chewing, structural integrity and dye and bacterial penetration were assessed.
Sixty bovine incisors were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10): G1, 5.25% NaOCl + 17% EDTA; G2, 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel; G3, 5.25% NaOCl; G4, 17% EDTA; G5, 2% CHX + 17% EDTA; and G6, 0.9% sodium chloride solution (control). Teeth were chemomechanically prepared and fractured into two fragments. One fragment was used for PLM, and the other was used for SEM analysis.
In stage 1, experiments were performed to characterize the efficacy of collapsing cavitation bubbles to deliver the miniature plaster beads into a tubular channel model. In stage 2, experiments were conducted on root-dentin blocks to test the efficacy of HIFU applied at 27 kHz for 2 minutes to deliver antibacterial nanoparticles into dentinal tubules. After the stage 2 experiment, the samples were sectioned and analyzed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis.
Roots of 60 maxillary incisors were used. Twenty-four hours after obturation, the filling materials of root canals were removed to a depth of 12 mm, and 4 groups were randomly formed. In 3 groups, root dentin was flared to produce a space between fiber post and canal walls. In the control group, the roots were not experimentally weakened. The flared roots were bulk restored with composite resin, which was light-activated through the translucent post for 40, 80, or 120 seconds. Posts were cemented, and after 24 hours, all roots were sectioned transversely in the coronal, middle, and apical regions, producing 1-mm-thick slices. Push-out test was performed, and failure modes were observed.
The plastic blocks were divided into seven groups. The control (C) group with brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth (sterile) received only needle irrigation. The remaining groups were incubated with BHI inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis. Irrigation and agitation techniques were ultrasonic, needle irrigation, EndoVac irrigation (Smart Endodontics; Discus Dental, Culver City, CA), EndoActivator (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Tulsa, OK), F-File (Plastic Endo, Lincolnshire, IL), and sonic. Sterile water was the irrigant in all treatments. Remaining bacteria were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The crystal violet was extracted using a detergent and measured spectrophotometrically.
Based on prescans, mandibular molars with joining mesial root canals and isthmuses between these were selected (n = 6). The mean volume filled with apparent hard-tissue debris after instrumentation without irrigation was calculated over 2 mm of the mesial canal system by multiplying the voxel volume with the number of voxels representing acquired radiopaque material. Backscattered electron imaging was used to compare the calcium-phosphorus content of this material with that of the root dentin in the same specimen.
A sample of 36 human upper canines was prepared and assigned to experimental groups (n = 12), designated as group 1, Resilon/Epiphany; group 2, Resilon/Epiphany SE; and group 3, AH Plus/gutta-percha. After the filling procedures, each tooth was prepared for push-out assessment by using root slices of 1-mm thickness. Loading was performed on a universal testing machine at a speed of 0.5 mm/min. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey test for multiple comparisons were used to compare the results among the experimental groups.
A modified direct contact test was used. Bacteria in suspension were exposed to the materials for 2-60 minutes by using sealers that were freshly mixed or set for 1, 3, and 7 days. The pH values and contact angles of sterile water on sealers at different times after setting were also measured.
Sixty extracted maxillary molars (180 canals) used in prior studies were reevaluated for analyses of the apical 4 mm. Teeth were scanned by using micro-computed tomography before and after canal shaping with FlexMaster, GT-Rotary, Lightspeed, ProFile, ProTaper, instruments or nickel-titanium K-files for hand instrumentation. Apical preparation was to a size #40 in mesiobuccal and distobuccal and #45 in palatal canals except for GT (#20) and ProTaper (#25 in mesiobuccal and distobuccal and #30 in palatal canals, respectively). Data for canal volume changes, the structure model index (quantifying canal cross sections), and untreated surface area were contrasted by using analysis of variance and Scheff√© tests.
In this report, four cases are presented involving the root canal treatment of maxillary first and second molars with unusual morphologic configurations of the palatal root canals.
Qualitative in-depth interview study.
4 NHS hospital trusts.
24 junior doctors who had been offered an HIV test as part of their pre-employment occupational health checks.
Qualitative study from an academic cardiology clinic, using semistructured interviews with 18 survivors of sudden cardiac death.
Secondary analysis of qualitative data from 26 black Caribbean and 19 white British patients with advanced cancer.
The analysis used data from the NLSY79, a nationally representative sample of 12,686 men and women. The NLSY79 collected detailed information about personal and family characteristics, including alcohol and other substance use, for a cohort of individuals who were between the ages of 14 and 22 when first surveyed in 1979. The survey was re-administered each year through 1994 and on a biennial basis since then. The dataset provides information on parental drinking and identifies problematic drinking behaviors both among mothers and fathers. Beginning with the 1998 survey, an extensive health module was administered to respondents over 40 years of age to provide a baseline health profile of the respondents before retirement. It includes a set of measures that assess the mental, physical, and behavioral health of the respondents when they reached the age of 40.
Estimation was conducted using propensity score matching (PSM) methods. Through the use of PSM methods, we control for a rich set of observed demographic, household, geographic, and economic characteristics, as well as unobserved features correlated with these variables, that predispose a parent to drink problematically, thereby reducing the possibility of estimation bias. In addition, PSM is superior to traditional multivariate regression in that it allows for the possibility of non-linear effects and the comparison of treatment and control individuals with similar characteristics.
Two country typologies are investigated. The first typology uses the Grade of Membership approach to group 112 countries with similar policies, programs, legislation, treatment and mental health funding methods for 2001. The second is the hierarchical cluster approach, which uses scientific papers and patents from 118 countries as proxies for science and technology in 2001.
Data were collected in five municipalities in Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Finland, using a short questionnaire containing questions on e.g. the reason for the visit, time spent during the visit, and of the client's psychosocial functioning (Global Assessment of Function Scale, GAF). The questionnaire was completed at all individual clients' visits to these services during a two-week period in December 2003, by professionals (MD's, nurses, social workers etc.) who worked in either local health or social services. Descriptive statistics and several regression techniques were used to describe and analyse factors associated with the use and costs of services.
This study uses two linked, nationally representative surveys, the 1999 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), to identify the population of interest. Depression was systematically assessed using a short form of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview--Short Form (CIDI-SF). To control for differences from potentially confounding factors, we matched depressed cases to controls using propensity score matching.
We performed a retrospective cohort study among 2201 five-year survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma treated before age 51 between 1965 and 1995. We compared incidence rates of clinically verified stroke and TIA with those in the general population. We used multivariable Cox regression techniques to study treatment-related factors and other risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.
We analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded Merkel cell carcinoma tissue samples from 114 of 207 patients diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma in Finland from 1979 to 2004 for the presence of MCPyV DNA with the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR, and DNA sequencing and examined associations between tumor MCPyV DNA status and histopathologic factors and survival. The median follow-up time after Merkel cell carcinoma diagnosis for subjects who were alive was 9.9 years (range = 4.9-21.9 years). All P values are two-sided.
We collected information on treatment, mortality, chronic medical conditions, and neurocognitive functioning of adult 5-year survivors of CNS malignancies diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 within the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Using competing risk framework, we calculated cumulative mortality according to cause of death and cumulative incidence of subsequent neoplasms according to exposure and dose of cranial radiation therapy (RT). Neurocognitive impairment and socioeconomic outcomes were assessed with respect to dose of CNS radiotherapy to specific brain regions. Cumulative incidence of chronic medical conditions was compared between survivors and siblings using Cox regression models. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.
Criteria that are based on four clinical or public health applications were used to compare BCRAT with BCRATplus7, which includes the seven genotypes. Criteria included number of expected life-threatening events for the decision to take tamoxifen, expected decision losses (in units of the loss from giving a mammogram to a woman without detectable breast cancer) for the decision to have a mammogram, rates of risk reclassification, and number of lives saved by risk-based allocation of screening mammography. For all calculations, the following assumptions were made: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage equilibrium across SNPs, additive effects of alleles at each locus, no interactions on the logistic scale among SNPs or with factors in BCRAT, and independence of SNPs from factors in BCRAT.
NDRG4 promoter methylation was analyzed in human colorectal cancer cell lines, colorectal tissue, and noncancerous colon mucosa by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bisulfite sequencing. NDRG4 mRNA and protein expression were studied using real-time-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Tumor suppressor functions of NDRG4 were examined by colony formation, cell proliferation, and migration and invasion assays in colorectal cancer cell lines that were stably transfected with an NDRG4 expression construct. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to examine the utility of NDRG4 promoter methylation as a biomarker in fecal DNA from 75 colorectal cancer patients and 75 control subjects. All P values are two-sided.
Records were reviewed from 273 autopsies performed to investigate asbestosis over an 11-year period. Accrued data included age and gender as well as the presence or absence of the following: occupational exposure to asbestos, antemortem clinical diagnosis of asbestosis by chest radiograph, fibrous pleural plaques, peribronchiolar or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, ferruginous bodies in histologic sections of lung tissue, and ferruginous bodies in digested lung tissue.
A retrospective review of all pediatric patients surgically treated with a calcaneonavicular coalition resection from January 1999 to December 2006, was performed. Presenting symptoms and examination findings were recorded. Postoperative examinations and imaging studies were evaluated to grade reossification, and functional outcomes were assessed for all patients with minimum 1-year postoperative follow-up. In addition, a cadaveric study was performed to compare the efficacy of EDB and fat graft interposition in terms of filling the postresection gap.
Fifty-two patients with a mean age of 13.7 years (range, 5 to 21 y) were randomized to receive either BtX-A or an equivalent volume of sterile saline solution (placebo group), as a single dose during the surgical procedure. Pain, medication use, quality of life, and functional mobility outcomes were assessed in all patients. Adverse events were reported for all patients and classified as minor or major.
Data for this study were culled from the Kids' Inpatient Database for the years 2000, 2003, and 2006 using the E-code for injuries caused by agricultural machinery to identify the study group. Only those children with fractures (nonskull) and/or amputations were included for analysis.
The study group consisted of patients of less than 18 years of age from the National Trauma Data Bank with a reported in-hospital mortality status. Variables analyzed were (1) patient demographics, (2) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) values, (3) ED vital signs, (4) injury mechanism, and (5) number of days from trauma until admission. Chi-square-assisted interaction detection (CHAID) profiled patient subgroups. The final cohort was randomly divided into 2 equal sets: a training set to subgroup patients and a testing set to validate the prediction accuracy.
Five separate observers on 2 separate occasions evaluated 30 AP and 30 frog-leg lateral radiographs of patients with unilateral SCFE for head/shaft angle, percent epiphyseal displacement, and width of epiphysis lateral to Klein's Line.
One hundred and five patients with 129 slips (24 bilateral) were reviewed. Minimum follow-up was 5 years and mean follow-up was 66 months. Slips over 60 degrees were considered grade 3. All of the patients underwent in situ pinning with a single cannulated screw; the placement of the screw was evaluated with the criteria of Stambough. The final evaluation was performed using the Iowa Hip Score and results were analyzed by sex, age at time of diagnosis, and body mass index. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Mann-Whitney U-test considering a P value of less than 0.005 to be statistically significant.
This paper presents 2 unusual cases of Choi type II sequelae associated with a large osteocartilaginous prominence or bump of the femoral head, responsible for cam-type femoroacetabular impingement in preadolescence.
Datasets were created from UPDB statewide birth certificates and from the University of Utah Health Sciences Center enterprise data warehouse using records for DDH and linked to the UPDB. Controls for the dataset were selected that matched cases on birth year and sex and 10 controls were selected per case. Statistics computed for each family were the number of descendants, the observed number of affected, the expected number of affected, P value, familial standardize incidence ratio, relative risks (RRs), and standard error. A kinship analysis tool was used to find pedigrees with excess DDH.
The participants were adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis from a randomized clinical trial comparing 2 spinal implants. Patients, and their parents, were surveyed by mail before (May 2005) and after (January 2008) receiving the results of the study. The first survey focused on clinical trial experience, satisfaction with surgery, and eliciting the preferred method for receiving clinical trial results. The second survey examined patient and parent reactions to the trial results letter.
Functional and SF-36 questionnaires were sent to the 66 patients with achondroplasia who underwent instrumented lumbar fusion at our institution from 1991 to 2006. Of the 35 who returned questionnaires, 13 had fusions to the sacrum and 22 did not. Chi-square analysis and a t test were used to evaluate outcomes. Significance was set at P&lt;0.05 or a 95% confidence interval that did not cross 1.
Hemiepiphysiodesis for angular deformity in 63 lower extremities from 2000 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-nine limbs received staple hemiepiphysiodesis and 24 received 8-plate hemiepiphysiodesis. Angular measurements were compared preoperatively, during the first year postoperatively, and at the time of hardware removal or skeletal maturity. Complications requiring additional surgery for the correction of angular deformity were noted in each group.
Quadriceps peak torque values from 55 athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction were analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 15.93+/-1.65 years (40 girls, 15 boys). Isokinetic data were obtained using the Biodex System 3. Quadriceps muscle recovery was defined as achieving &gt;or=85% peak torque for side-to-side comparison.
A retrospective study was performed on 91 children (average age 3.2+/-2.2 y) who lacked external rotation beyond neutral and had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of bilateral shoulders performed at our institution between 2000 and 2007. The charts were reviewed for the measurement of the external rotation of the involved shoulder with the arm adducted and the scapula stabilized. The glenoscapular angle (glenoid version), the percentage of the humeral head anterior to the middle of the glenoid fossa (PHHA), and the angle of rotation of the biceps tendon (biceps angle) were measured on MRI scans of both shoulders. Statistical analysis was performed to compare these MRI measurements for the involved and uninvolved sides, and to identify the correlations between them and the external rotation.
Eighty-five children with BPBP between 6 and 18 years of age were queried about their participation in athletics. Information regarding sports played, duration of activity, level of participation, and injuries sustained was obtained and compared with published age-matched normative pediatric data. In addition, measurements of upper limb function and patient/parent-derived functional outcomes assessments were obtained using the modified Mallet classification, the Toronto Test Score, the Hospital for Sick Children Active Movement Scale, and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument.
A retrospective case series was performed, consisting of 33 children with hemiplegic-type cerebral palsy who had undergone surgical reconstruction of the thumb between 1998 and 2006. All children had preoperative and postoperative Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity Evaluation analyses performed (mean time to follow-up was 2 y and 2 mo). Static modified House scale of thumb alignment, dynamic thumb positional analysis, and the spontaneous functional use of the involved extremity were compared and contrasted.
Thirteen patients (6 male, 7 female) with a mean age of 10.5 years, underwent single percutaneous injection of alpha-BSM for presumed UBC. The aspiration of the cysts was followed by vigorous saline lavage using 2 wide bore needles to disrupt the cyst walls. alpha-BSM "paste" was then injected under fluoroscopic guidance. Radiographs were digitized to measure cystic area (millimeter squares) on 2 orthogonal views. Healing was rated according to a modified Neer outcome grading system. Nine of the 13 patients had had pathologic fractures in the past. Eleven of the 13 patients had had past unsuccessful treatment: multiple steroid injections in 6, curettage and bone grafting in 3, and bone marrow and demineralized bone matrix (Grafton) injection in 2.
We prospectively collected data from children presenting to Birmingham Children's Hospital and The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne who fitted our diagnostic criteria for septic arthritis and osteomyelitis over a 52-month period. Inclusion criteria for entry into the database were children &lt;or=16 years of age who had no underlying disease or medical therapy predisposing to infection, and who had symptoms for less than 14 days before presentation. They were all started on intravenous antibiotics and a predetermined treatment algorithm was followed. All patients with septic arthritis also underwent joint washout. The patients were converted to oral antibiotics once they improved clinically and hematologically. Regular outpatient follow-up continued for 1 year with blood tests and x-rays.
We matched 30 patients in the early stage and 30 patients in the late stage of bipolar disorder, diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, with 60 healthy controls (30 matched for each group of patients). We measured symptomatic status using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Young Mania Rating Scale.
We implanted rats with a VNS electrode and stimulator. We used the selective noradrenergic toxin DSP-4 to lesion NE neurons of the locus coeruleus. We recorded dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons under chloral hydrate anesthesia. We recorded hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons using 5-barreled iontophoretic pipettes.
We investigated cell densities and sizes in BA24 among suicide completers and matched sudden-death controls. We examined a 1-cm(3) tissue block from BA24a of the supracallosal ACC in 26 human postmortem brain specimens (13 depressed individuals who committed suicide and 13 controls). We assessed neuronal and glial cell densities as well as neuronal soma sizes in the upper and lower cortical layers using optical fractionator and nucleator 3-dimensional stereological probes.
We compared 2 groups of unmedicated female patients with BPD (10 with and 15 without comorbid PTSD) and 25 healthy female controls. We used T(1)- and T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance images for manual tracing and 3-dimensional reconstruction of the hippocampus and amygdala.
Eleven patients with gSAD who were not taking psychotropic medications and did not have psychiatric comorbidities and 11 matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing blocks of emotionally salient (positive, negative, neutral) pictures.
We obtained electroencephalography recordings from 28 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and matched healthy controls during perception of facial emotion under both conscious and nonconscious conditions. We extracted gamma-band synchrony from the electroencephalogram. We also used behavioural measures of emotion identification, emotional intelligence, negativity bias and social function, along with ratings of first-episode schizophrenia symptoms. We analyzed group differences and predicted social cognition to assess the potential contribution of medication.
Between August and December 2006, we assessed ASRs (elicited by 8 consecutive tones of 104 dB, interstimulus interval of about 2 min) in 25 patients and 25 matched controls using a case-control design and in 9 nonaffected siblings. We recorded the electromyographic activity of 6 muscles and the sympathetic skin response. We investigated response occurrence (probability %) and response magnitude (area under the curve in microV x ms) of the combined response of 6 muscles and of the single blink response.
We determined serum BDNF, platelet 5-HT content and platelet 5-HT uptake in 33 patients in the acAN group, 20 patients in the recAN group and 33 controls. Plasma leptin served as an indicator of malnutrition.
The HISPAMEC Registry is a multicenter international study group dedicated to collecting data on patients diagnosed with SAD with serological evidence of chronic HCV infection. The information sources are cases reported by physicians of the HISPAMEC Study Group and periodic surveillance of reported cases by a Medline search updated up to December 31, 2007.
Patients with early RA who received adalimumab plus MTX (n = 240), adalimumab (n = 222), or MTX (n = 216) were grouped by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response, 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28), or remission-like state [tender joint count (TJC) = 0; DAS28 &lt; 2.6; swollen joint count = 0; ACR100] at 26 and 104 weeks. Radiographic progression was assessed by cumulative probability plots, mean changes in total Sharp score (DeltaTSS), and percentages of progressors (DeltaTSS &gt; 0.5).
This cross-sectional study was conducted in 122 patients with RA. Lipid profiles of patients were compared with a control group, consisting of a population-based study cohort (DRECE study), matched for sex, age, menopausal status, and body mass index. Excess lipoprotein(a) was defined by a serum concentration &gt; 0.3 g/l.
Eleven patients eligible for a knee arthroscopy were studied. Acoustic quantification was carried out by a digital image analysis program that detects the time-dependent increase [intensity (time) = k x time + C] of gray-level intensity in all the pixels of a specific region of interest (ROI) following intravenous injection of the microbubble contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride. Echo-guided synovial biopsies were carried out in the same ROI. Synovial vessel areas were quantified after Factor VIII immunostaining of synovial biopsies using an automated digital image analysis.
Databases of 1892 patients of 7 rheumatologists in Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland, and 478 of one author in Nashville, TN, USA, seen in usual care, were reviewed for the first recorded ESR and CRP, and all RF tests.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both knees was conducted in 92 male floor layers and 49 male graphic designers (referents), with a mean age of 55.6 years (range 42-70 yrs). The presence of grade 3 MRI signal intensities indicating degenerative tears of the anterior, middle, and posterior one-third of the lateral and medial menisci was assessed on 1.5-Tesla MRI scans. The odds ratio (OR) of meniscal tears was determined among floor layers compared to graphic designers. Using logistic regression, models were adjusted for age, body mass index, and knee-straining sports.
In an observational cohort study from a single academic center, NP events and their attribution were identified at enrollment and at annual assessments for up to 7 years. NP events were characterized using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions; other variables were global SLE disease activity and cumulative organ damage. The outcomes of NP events were recorded and self-report HRQOL was measured with the mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component summary scores of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36.
The implementation package was developed to address specific barriers towards prescription of COBRA therapy and comprised informational handouts (an information booklet and leaflet for patients), preprinted prescription orders, and background information on COBRA therapy for the rheumatologists. Twenty-two rheumatologists agreed to participate, including the arthritis nurse where available. Rheumatologists, nurses, and patients were asked to record their experience. All Dutch arthritis nurses were invited to an educational session on COBRA therapy.
Eighty-seven consecutive patients with SSc were included and prospectively investigated; they underwent 6MWT in addition to conventional assessment of possible lung, heart, kidney, skin, and muscle involvement, and disease activity scoring, severity, and quality of life determination.
A retrospective analysis of medical records from 9 Italian rheumatologic referral centers was carried out. All patients with SRC and an available serum sample at the time of crisis were included. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence, anti-topoisomerase (topo) I by enzyme-linked assay (ELISA), anti-RNA polymerases (RNAP) by ELISA for the subunit III, and immunoprecipitation (IP) were performed.
The screening strategy included tuberculosis skin test (TST), QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QTG) test, standard chest radiograph, and contrast enhanced-computerized tomography of the chest (CT).
In a retrospective study, charts of patients with chronic form of primary (idiopathic) arthritis followed from our center since 1970 were reviewed and clinical/laboratory variables were collected for further analysis.
Patients with cSLE (n = 98) followed every 3 months completed HRQOL measures, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core scale (PedsQL-GC), the Rheumatology Module (PedsQL-RM), and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The British Isles Lupus Activity Group Index (BILAG) was used to measure organ-system-specific disease activity. Physicians rated the course of cSLE between visits.
We created a database of patients with RA, PsA, or AS treated with anti-TNF agents (etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab) at a large outpatient rheumatology clinic. Patient characteristics, baseline HAQ prior to treatment, subsequent yearly HAQ, and reasons for termination were collected. The cost based on percentage of patients achieving &gt;or= 0.2 improvement in HAQ (minimal clinically important difference, MCID) was calculated using the 2008 direct cost (Cdn) of the medication.
From a joint replacement registry, 70 male and 70 female patients were randomly selected and matched for age, body mass index, comorbidity, procedure, and education. Patients completed the AHI prior to surgery. Functional status was assessed at baseline and 1-year followup with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score. Linear regression modeling was used to determine the effect of sex on predicting AHI scores. A second model was constructed to examine the effect of AHI on the 1-year WOMAC change score.
Sera from adults with active RA despite MTX therapy, who received subcutaneous injections of placebo + MTX (MTX alone, n = 34) or golimumab 50 or 100 mg every 2 or 4 weeks + MTX (n = 137), were analyzed for levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin 18 (IL-18), E-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1).
Four hundred ninety-eight men and 468 women aged 59-71 years were recruited. A lifestyle questionnaire was administered, and bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Two hundred fifty-four men and 271 women had repeat bone densitometry 4 years later. DNA was obtained from whole blood samples using standard extraction techniques. Single nucleotide variants in the growth hormone releasing hormone gene (GHRH, G/A 223 Phe75Leu, rs4988492), growth hormone releasing hormone receptor gene (GHRHR, G/A 217, Ala57Thr, rs4988496), the growth hormone secretagogue receptor gene (GHSR, T/C, Gly57Gly, rs495225), and the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR, T/G, noncoding, rs2940944) were analyzed.
Patients with prior/current digital ulcers or never affected were identified in the cohort of SSc patients enrolled in the French Itin√©rAIR-Scl√©rodermie registry. Rodnan skin scores, pulmonary function test results, and clinical and immunological data were analyzed to identify digital ulcerassociated clinical features.
SSc patients at a large referral hospital self-reported on a number of comorbidities. Their inpatient and outpatient medical records were abstracted using a standardized data extraction form. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the self-reported diagnoses were calculated using data from the chart review as gold standard.
A very early arthritis clinic (NOR-VEAC) was established as a multicenter study. General practitioners were asked to refer patients presenting with at least 1 swollen joint of maximum 16 weeks' duration. Clinical and laboratory markers were examined.
In 135 patients with suspected SS, the grades of 5 US measures of both parotid and submandibular salivary glands were scored (0-48 scale). Diagnosis of primary SS was established following the American-European Consensus Group criteria of 2002. The patients' total scintigraphic score (0-12 scale) was determined and the histopathological changes of minor salivary glands graded. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the US scoring system.
Sixty-three patients with SSc fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology and/or Leroy and Medsger criteria were retrospectively studied, including 30 (47.6%) with limited cutaneous and 27 (42.9%) with diffuse cutaneous SSc. Forty-one patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, 11 patients only CT scan, and the remaining 11 patients only MRI. Cerebral vasculopathy on MRI and CT scan was defined as absent or mild (score &lt; 1), moderate (1 &lt;or= score &lt; 2), or severe (score &gt;or= 2) on a 4-point scale (0 to 3).
The 813 patients in the ESPOIR cohort were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and HBs antigen.
HCRT scans prospectively performed before (n = 9 patients) and after (n = 47) AHSCT were blindly reviewed by 2 independent investigators using the Wells score.
A total of 210 patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven GCA and 678 matched controls were included in our study. DNA from patients and controls was obtained from peripheral blood. Samples were genotyped for the TLR4-(+896 A/G) (rs4986790) gene polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction, using a predesigned TaqMan allele discrimination assay.
We used data from a longitudinal sample of North Carolina tobacco farmers across 5 waves of data collection (1997-2005) (baseline N = 749 farmers). Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine changes in attitudes toward tobacco control and tobacco manufacturers, controlling for economic dependence on tobacco, and demographic factors.
In 2005, over 25,000 rural residents in 16 states completed the first-ever IPV module within the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The BRFSS is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored annual random-digit-dialed telephone survey. The BRFSS provides surveillance of health behaviors and health risks among the non-institutionalized adult population of the United States and several US territories.
OHP claims data from 2002 to 2003 were used to assess quality of diabetic care for beneficiaries residing in urban areas or rural areas with or without at least 1 RHC. Study subjects included Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) or disabled beneficiaries, aged 18-64, who were enrolled in the OHP for 12 months per study year and had at least 1 claim with a diabetes diagnosis (n = 6,267). Diabetes-related primary care was measured by the proportion of patients receiving each of 3 recommended tests at least once during the calendar year: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, and eye exam. Logistic regression models were used to identify differences in testing rates across the geographic areas, after controlling for individual differences including age, race, sex, and health status.
Claims data from 237,500 claimants in 2 large insurance companies in Washington state for calendar year 2002 were analyzed, using adjusted clinical group risk adjustment for differences in disease burden and rural urban commuting area codes for rurality definition.
Using 7 classification systems, we counted VA health care enrollees who lived in each category, and number admitted to VA hospitals or non-VA hospitals under Medicare. For dual VA-Medicare enrollees over age 65, we compared VA and private sector hospitalizations on numbers of admissions and bed-days of care. We compared VA enrollees' relative proportions across rural to urban categories for each classification system and evaluated discordance between systems at the veterans-integrated service networks (VISN) level.
Cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey (NNAS), a nationally representative survey of 3,017 CNAs; analysis was restricted to 2,897 currently working CNAs. Location was categorized as metropolitan, micropolitan, or neither (other rural county). Demographics included age, sex, race, education, income, and years at present job. Analyses were weighted to reflect the complex sampling design.
Open-ended interviews were conducted with 30 mothers of adolescent women in 3 rural counties in southern Oregon. Thematic analysis within and across interviews using constant comparative analysis was used to explore barriers, facilitators and strategies mothers identified in talking with their daughters about contraception.
A cross-sectional, descriptive survey design was used to collect primary data in 2005. The manager/owner listed for each of the 279 non-metropolitan community pharmacy sites in Wisconsin was surveyed using an 8-page instrument. The 7 drug therapy services that key informants were asked to report on included 6 disease state management (DSM) programs and medication therapy management services (MTMS). Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables describing the pharmacy sites and how DTS were provided. Logistic regression was performed, with any drug therapy service provision as the dependent variable and 8 independent variables.
Data were collected using a survey design. The questionnaire gathered demographic data, number and type(s) of certifications held, and comfort level with 7 emergency interventions. The sample was recruited from registered nurses (RNs) working in 10 Critical Access Hospitals that represented different geographic locations and different distances to larger, more comprehensive hospitals in an upper Midwestern state.
Surveys were mailed to health care professionals in the HPRN. Participating clinics (n = 21) distributed patient surveys on CRC screening to persons aged &gt; or =50 for a 2-week period in 2006.
Readmissions within 30 days of patients who were admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit using a MIPA model of care (N = 147) were compared to readmissions of a comparison group of patients who were admitted prior to the adoption of the MIPA (N = 37). Case mix differences were adjusted using multiple logistic regression analysis (N = 184).
To control for accounting aberrations within a given year, we selected RRCs that reported 3 consecutive fiscal years of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) cost report data, starting with fiscal year 2004 and ending with fiscal year 2006. Given a limited sample size of 28 for-profit RRCs and 127 non-profits, we used the non-parametric median test to assess median differences in operational and key financial measures between the 2 groups.
We performed a population-based cohort study of all residents 97 years and older in the Klamath Basin, a rural region in southern Oregon. The prevalence of disabling conditions was determined by in-person examination.
Ninety-three overweight or obese children (aged 8 to 14 years) and their parent(s) participated in this randomized controlled trial, which included a 4-month intervention and 6-month follow-up. Families were randomized to either a behavioral family-based intervention (n = 33), a behavioral parent-only intervention (n = 34), or a waitlist control condition (n = 26). Only program costs data for the parent-only and family-based programs are reported here (n = 67). Assessments were completed at baseline, post-treatment (month 4) and follow-up (month 10). The primary outcome measures were total program costs and cost per child for the parent-only and family interventions.
In a cohort of patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma studied longitudinally since 1996 and until 2007, PAR1 over-expression was assessed by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow citometry. Chi-square and log rank tests were used to determine whether there was a statistical association between PAR1 overexpression and metastases, mortality, and survival. Multivariate analysis was performed including HER1, stage, ER and nodes status to evaluate PAR1 as an independent prognostic factor.
We used FACS to analyze VLC in ovarian and non-ovarian tumors, and characterize the relationship of VLC and Tie2-monocytes. We performed qRT-PCR and FACS on human VLC to assess the expression of the CD52 antigen, the target of the immunotherapeutic Alemtuzumab. We assessed Alemtuzumab's ability to induce complement-mediated VLC killing in vitro and in human tumor ascites. Finally we assessed the impact of anti-CD52 immuno-toxin therapy on murine ovarian tumor growth.
One hundred and thirty-three diabetic cats 120 newly diagnosed and 13 previously treated.
Prospective, uncontrolled clinical trial. Cats were treated with PZIR twice daily for 45 days. Control of glycemia was assessed on days 7, 14, 30, and 45 by evaluation of change in water consumption, frequency of urination, appetite, and body weight, serum fructosamine concentration, and blood glucose concentrations determined 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 hours after administration of PZIR. Adjustments in dosage of PZIR were made as needed to control glycemia.
Client-owned nonazotemic geriatric (&gt;or=9 years) cats.
Prospective longitudinal cohort study monitoring a population of healthy nonazotemic geriatric cats every 6 months until development of azotemia, death, or the study end point (September 30, 2007). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess baseline clinical, biochemical, and urinalysis variables, urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/C), urine albumin to creatinine (UA/C) ratio, and urinary NAG index as predictors of development of azotemia.
Nine healthy client-owned dogs.
Prospective study. Arthrocentesis was performed under sedation on 4 joints (both carpi, 1 tarsus, 1 stifle) on each dog every 3 weeks, a total of 4 times. Automated cell counts were done on stifle fluid, smears were made, and differential cell counts done on smears from all joints. Slides were evaluated microscopically for erythrocyte numbers, total nucleated cell count, differential cell count, and cell morphology. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance.
Seven dogs with 1 or more gastrointestinal masses composed primarily of eosinophilic infiltrates for which no underlying cause was found.
Retrospective case series.
Three affected BSH, NWF, Siberians, Sphynx, 2 MC (without the known MC mutation), and 2 Domestic Shorthair cats (controls) were studied.
Prospective, observational study. Exonic and splice site regions of the genes encoding the proteins cardiac troponin I, troponin T, MYBPC3, cardiac essential myosin light chain, cardiac regulatory myosin light chain, alpha tropomyosin, actin, and beta-myosin heavy chain were sequenced. Sequences were compared for nucleotide changes between affected cats, the published DNA sequences, and control cats. Changes were considered to be causative for HCM if they involved a conserved amino acid and changed the amino acid to a different polarity, acid-base status, or structure.
Fifteen dogs with clinical signs consistent with hypothyroidism and abnormal stimulation results with 75 microg rhTSH and 18 clinically healthy dogs.
All dogs were stimulated with 75 and 150 microg rhTSH IV in a 1st and 2nd stimulation test, respectively. Blood samples were taken before and 6 hours after rhTSH administration for determination of total T4 concentration.
Twenty client-owned dogs with SRMA presented to the University of Glasgow Small Animal Hospital between May 2006 and May 2008.
A prospective, observational study: CBC, biochemistry, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses were performed. C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid-A, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and haptoglobin (Hp) were assessed in the serum. IgA concentrations were determined in the serum and CSF.

Retrospective case series. Cases were obtained by personal communication with 1 of 2 authors (TJVW, DPO).
Two hundred and twenty-one colic horses and 15 control horses.
Prospective observational clinical study. Blood and peritoneal fluid were collected on admission. Horses were grouped according to diagnosis, peritoneal fluid analysis, and outcome. Peritoneal D-dimer concentration was determined, together with peritoneal tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activities. Plasma D-dimer concentration also was measured.
Six healthy adult alpacas.
After food was withheld for 8 hours, alpacas were given, on subsequent days in a randomly determined order, either 0.2 microg/kg of exenatide or similar volume of isotonic saline SC. Blood samples were collected before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes after treatment. A rapid dextrose (0.5 g/kg) injection was given after the time 60 samples. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at each time point.
The percentages and numbers of Tregs and nonregulatory T cells and B cells were assessed in 34 dogs with cancer and 9 age-matched control dogs. Dogs evaluated included 14 dogs with sarcoma, 7 dogs with carcinoma, 7 dogs with lymphoma, and 6 dogs with mast cell tumor.
Numbers and percentages of Tregs, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells and B cells were determined using flow cytometry and compared between control dogs and dogs with cancer.
Client-owned 15 healthy control dogs and 23 small breed dogs with CMVI classified by severity, based on the classification system determined by the international small animal cardiac heart council.
Prospective, controlled, observational study. The expression levels of SRCR genes (SERCA2alpha, PLN, and HAX-1) were evaluated in peripheral blood of dogs at different stages of CMVI via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Fourteen hypothyroid dogs without abnormalities on renal ultrasound examination or urinalysis.
Blood pressure and GFR (measured by exogenous creatinine clearance) were measured before treatment (T0, n=14) and at 1 month (T1, n=14) and at 6 months (T6, n=11) after beginning levothyroxine supplementation therapy (20 microg/kg/d, PO). The response to therapy was monitored at T1 by measuring serum total thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations. If needed, levothyroxine dosage was adjusted and reassessed after 1 month. Statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model. Results are expressed as mean+/-standard deviation.
Seventy-seven clinically diseased cattle and 19 healthy control cattle.
Serum cTnI concentrations were measured using an Immunlite Troponin I immunometric chemiluminescent assay in consecutive cases of postmortem-confirmed pericarditis (n=18), endocarditis (n=15), chronic suppurative pneumonia (n=13), congenital heart disease (n=10), reticulitis (n=3), mediastinal abscess (n=7), thymic lymphoma (n=6), and caudal vena cava thrombosis (n=5). Serum cTnI concentrations were measured in 19 healthy cattle.
One hundred and nine dogs with hyperadrenocorticism were included: 91 with ADHAC and 18 with AIHAC.
Retrospective study. Dogs displaying feedback inhibition after the dexamethasone suppression test, adrenal symmetry, or both were considered to have ADHAC. AIHAC was demonstrated by adrenal tumor histology. For each group, ACTH determination by ILMA was reviewed.
In a double-blind cross-over study, 16 dogs received each diet for 4 weeks. Dogs in group T first received the test diet and then the control diet, whereas dogs in group C were fed the diets in the opposite order. Different variables (body weight, body condition score, HE score, fecal score, CBC, plasma tests of liver function including NH3, and coagulation tests) were measured at the start of the study and after completion of each diet.
Data were collected from the medical records of 4 horses presented to Washington State University as well as the 23 previously published case reports of horses with renal carcinoma.
Retrospective study.
Healthy dogs (n=15).
Interventional, experimental study. A restraint device was built to facilitate imaging of dogs in sternal recumbency. Each dog underwent videofluoroscopy during swallowing of liquid barium and barium-soaked kibble in sternal and lateral recumbency. Timing of swallowing, pharyngeal constriction ratio, esophageal transit time, and number of esophageal peristaltic waves were compared among body positions.
Seventy-two hospitalized foals and 23 healthy age-matched foals.
Basal ACTH and cortisol concentrations were measured and a paired low-dose (10 microg)/high-dose (100 microg) cosyntropin stimulation test was performed at admission in hospitalized foals. HPA axis dysfunction was defined as (1) an inappropriately low basal cortisol concentration or (2) an inadequate increase in cortisol concentration (delta cortisol) after administration of cosyntropin, with cut-off values for appropriate basal and delta cortisol concentrations determined from results obtained in healthy age-matched foals.
Five healthy Beagle dogs weighing 9.8-12.8 kg (3 males and 2 females; aged 2 years) were used.
A radiotelemetry system for continuous measurement of LAP was used in this study. Rupture of the chordae tendineae was experimentally induced via left atriotomy, and a transmitter catheter was inserted into the left atrium. The body of the transmitter was implanted SC. After clinical condition was stabilized, the severity of MR was evaluated by echocardiography, and LAP was recorded for 72 consecutive hours for the analysis of diurnal variation.
Three Standardbreds, 3 Thoroughbreds; age 8-14 years; body weight 517-606 kg.
Observational study. Repeated 2-dimensional echocardiographic examinations were performed in unsedated horses by 2 observers and subsequently analyzed by 2DST. Test reliability was determined for segmental and for averaged 2DST indices (including strain, strain rate, displacement, and rotation) by estimating measurement variability, within-day interobserver variability, between-day interobserver variability, and between-day intraobserver variability. Variability was expressed as coefficient of variation (percent) and the absolute value below which the difference between 2 measurements will lie with 95% probability.
Three mature, privately owned, affected siblings and their progeny produced in 2 litters.
Prospective, observational study. Two test matings of 1 affected sire with 2 of his affected sisters were used to determine the inheritance pattern. Affection status was determined by measuring venous blood ammonia concentrations, detection of the shunt by ultrasonography and confirmation during surgical attenuation of the intrahepatic shunting vessel.
We first carried out a genome-wide association (n = 17,967) and replication study (n = 13,615) to identify genetic loci associated with plasma CRP concentrations. Data collection took place between 1989 and 2008 and genotyping between 2003 and 2008. We carried out a mendelian randomization study of the most closely associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CRP locus and published data on other CRP variants involving a total of 28,112 cases and 100,823 controls, to investigate the association of CRP variants with coronary heart disease. We compared our finding with that predicted from meta-analysis of observational studies of CRP levels and risk of coronary heart disease. For the other loci associated with CRP levels, we selected the most closely associated SNP for testing against coronary heart disease among 14,365 cases and 32,069 controls.
Risk of coronary heart disease.
Cohort study of 5067 participants (mean age, 58 years; 60% women) without cardiovascular disease from Malm√∂, Sweden, who attended a baseline examination between 1991 and 1994. Participants underwent measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), cystatin C, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase 2, midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) and underwent follow-up until 2006 using the Swedish national hospital discharge and cause-of-death registers and the Stroke in Malm√∂ register for first cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary death).
Incident cardiovascular and coronary events.
Retrospective cohort study of 328,468 patients undergoing spinal fusion procedures from 2002-2006 identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, a 20% sample of US community hospitals.
The rates of use of BMP among patients undergoing spinal fusion procedures are examined along with complications, length of stay, and hospital charges associated with use of this fusion adjunct.
The participants were 44 outpatients receiving hemodialysis at Hospital B. The QOL was surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire, the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form. The following patient attributes and laboratory values were taken from the medical records: age; sex; primary disease; number of years on hemodialysis; complications; number of hours of hemodialysis per session; percentage weight gain; cardiothoracic ratio; blood pressure; hematocrit; and the serum levels of albumin, potassium, phosphorus, and calcium.
A randomized controlled trial design was used. Fifty comatose head injury patients were randomly allocated into a control group or an intervention group. The consciousness level of the patients in both groups was evaluated and recorded by the Glasgow Coma Scale, before and 30 min after the visiting program.
One-hundred-and-sixty-nine women who visited the health center of a city in Aomori Prefecture, Japan, at 4 months after childbirth for regular examination fulfilled the selection criteria and completed self-reporting questionnaires on postnatal depression using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and a life and social events scale.
We randomly assigned seven institutions into an experimental group (four institutions, n = 96) and a control group (three institutions, n = 44) using cluster randomization. The women in the experimental group were asked to continue stress management homework for 3 months. A nurse provided feedback on the homework every month. Those in the control group were given only the booklet. The primary outcomes were the risk ratios of "depression" and "anxiety" according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes were "health status" from the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) v2 and "satisfaction" from the Visual Analogue Scale. We excluded 15 women who became pregnant and performed an intention-to-treat analysis of 125 women.
A randomized controlled trial was carried out on outpatients with type 2 diabetes from two hospitals who met the criteria and gave consent to participate. They were randomly divided into an intervention group that followed the program and a control group that followed usual clinical practise. The intervention group received &lt;30 min of monthly interviews based on the program's textbook and biweekly telephone calls from a nurse educator throughout the 12 months.
Twenty-eight eyes from 14 patients with preoperative dry eye (dry eye group) and 70 eyes from 35 patients without preoperative dry eye (non-dry eye group) were studied prospectively. In each group, we measured values such as tear break-up time (tBUT), Schirmer I test (ST-I), tear meniscus height (TMH), and subjective dry eye symptoms (Sx), and evaluated the postoperative changes in these values. We also evaluated the influence of corneal incision location and shape on these values. The correlations between these values and microscopic light exposure time and phacoemulsification energy were investigated.
Twenty-eight eyes in 14 patients with VKH disease were reviewed retrospectively. These 28 eyes were divided into 19 eyes with intraretinal fluid (C group) and 9 eyes without intraretinal fluid (N group). Changes in visual acuity and fluid accumulation observed using OCT were compared between the two groups.
In a retrospective study, 44 eyes with diffuse diabetic macular edema were treated with an intravitreal injection of 4 mg (n=12 eyes), 8 mg (n=17) or 25 mg (n=15) of triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Optical coherence tomography, best-corrected logMAR visual acuity and Goldmann tonometry were performed at baseline, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment. Mean follow-up was 9.8 months (standard deviation=2.3) with a range of 5-12 months.
This retrospective non-comparative study investigated the outcomes of AGV implantation with silicone tube ligation and removable external stents in 95 eyes (90 patients) with at least 12 months of postoperative follow-up. Qualified success was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) of &lt;or=21 mmHg and &gt;or=6 mmHg regardless of anti-glaucoma medication. Those who required additional glaucoma surgery, implant removal or who had phthisis bulbi were considered failures. Hypotony was defined as an IOP of &lt;6 mmHg.
The rectus muscles of 37 subjects were analyzed. Distal myotendinous specimens were obtained from 3 normal subjects, 20 patients with acquired strabismus, 11 with infantile strabismus, and from 3 with congenital nystagmus, and were studied by using light microscopy. Some specimens (6 rectus muscles) were also examined by transmission electron microscopy.
We analyzed vascular malformations of head and neck regions in 21 patients with the use of three-phase CT, including pre-contrast phase, vascular phase (scan delay: 20-35 seconds after intravenous contrast material injection) and equilibrium phase (scan delay: 3-5 minutes) imaging. The flow characteristic of each lesion was determined and categorized as either a high- or a low-flow lesion according to findings on selective arteriography and/or direct puncture venography. The CT number was acquired from two areas in a vascular lesion, sorted by the enhancement pattern: area 1, a highly enhanced area seen on the vascular phase; area 2, a delayedly enhanced area seen on the equilibrium phase. The CT numbers of each phase were compared between high- and low-flow lesions with use of the unpaired t-test. The flow patterns of high- and low-flow lesions were analyzed by assessment of time-density curves of three phase CT.
This study included 32 AVMs from 32 patients who had been treated with radiosurgery (males/females: 21/11; average patient age, 33.1 years). The time interval between radiosurgery and MRA was an average of 35.3 months (range, 12-88 months). Three-dimensional TOF-MRA was obtained at a magnetic field strength of 3.0 Tesla after infusion of contrast media, with a measured voxel size of 0.40 x 0.80 x 1.4 (0.45) mm(3) and a reconstructed voxel size of 0.27 x 0.27 x 0.70 (0.05) mm(3) after zero-filling. X-ray angiography was performed as the reference of standard within six months after MRA (an average of two months). To determine the presence of a residual AVM, the source images of 3D TOF-MRA were independently reviewed, focusing on the presence of abnormally hyperintense fine tangled or tubular structures with continuity as seen on consecutive slices by two observers blinded to the X-ray angiography results.
One hundred and ten patients (76 patients with CAC) were scanned twice on prospective ECG-triggered scans. The scan parameters included 120 kV, 82 mAs, a 2.5 mm thickness, and an acquisition center at 45% of the RR interval. The interscan and interobserver variability on the CAC scores (Agatston, volume, and mass) was calculated. The factors affecting the variability were determined by plotting it against heart rate, BMI, and noise level (defined as the standard deviation: SD).
One hundred and nine patients with suspected coronary disease were divided into 2 groups according to a mean heart rate (&lt; 70 bpm and &gt;or= 70 bpm) and into 3 groups according to the mean Agatston calcium scores (&lt;or= 100, 101-400, and &gt; 400). Next, the effect of heart rate and calcification on the accuracy of coronary artery stenosis detection was analyzed by using an invasive coronary angiography as a reference standard. Coronary segments of less than 1.5 mm in diameter in an American Heart Association (AHA) 15-segment model were independently assessed.
From January 2000 to December 2004, 46 of 193 patients with an IA underwent transperineal US prior to corrective surgery. Sonographic findings were reviewed to identify the presence of internal fistulas and to determine "distal rectal pouch to perineum (P-P)" distances. IA types were determined based on the sonographic findings, and the diagnostic accuracy of transperineal US was evaluated based on surgical findings.
Between August 2000 and April 2008, five patients diagnosed with arterial esophageal bleeding by conventional angiography, CT-angiography or endoscopy, underwent a TAE with NBCA. We mixed NBCA with iodized oil at ratios of 1:1 to 1:4 to supply radiopacity and achieve a proper polymerization time. After embolization, we evaluated the angiographic and clinical success, recurrent bleeding, and procedure-related complications.
We retrospectively assessed 45 patients with 46 HCCs (mean size, 2.2 cm) adjacent to the gallbladder (&lt;or=1.0 cm) treated with RF ablation using an internally cooled electrode system. An electrode was inserted into the tumor either parallel (n = 38) or perpendicular (n = 8) to the gallbladder wall. The safety and therapeutic efficacy of the procedures were assessed with clinical and imaging follow-up examinations. Follow-up with the use of CT ranged from four to 45 months (mean, 19 months). The association between variables (electrode direction, electrode type, tumor size, tumor location, lobar location) and the presence of a residual tumor or local tumor progression was also analyzed.
Cyst ablation using a mixture of NBCA and iodized oil was performed in 99 cysts from 21 patients who had such symptoms as abdominal distension and pain. The collapse or reaccumulation of the ablated cysts after the procedure was assessed during the follow-up period of 36 to 90 months. The treatment effects, including symptom relief, and the clinical data such as the blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were also assessed, together with the complications.
From 2001 to 2008, 143 consecutive patients who underwent an angiography for acute arterial upper or lower GI bleeding were examined.
We retrospectively evaluated all of the consecutive patients who underwent an angiography for treatment of acute LGI bleeding between January 2003 and October 2007. In total, the study included 36 patients who underwent a colonoscopy and were diagnosed to have an active bleeding in the LGI tracts. Based on the visualization or non-visualization of the bleeding focus, determined by an angiography, the patients were classified into two groups. The clinical outcomes included technical success, clinical success (no rebleeding within 30 days), delayed rebleeding (&gt; 30 days), as well as the major and minor complication rates.
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Columbia University Medical Center and had an ethics consultation between August 1, 2006, and July 31, 2007. All mandatory and nonmandatory ethics consultations were reviewed. Patient diagnosis, prognosis, presence of do-not-resuscitate order, presence of written advance directives, reason for the ethics consultation, and survival data were collected. The number of ethics consultations hospital-wide from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, was collected.

Transient middle cerebral artery ischemia was induced in adult Wistar rats (n=13) using the monofilament method. In the experimental group (n=8), animals were harvested at days 3, 7, 10, 17 and 21 after ischemia. Five animals served as controls. Sagittal sections through the ischemic cortex were double-stained for neural (nestin and beta-tubulin, nestin and PCNA), glial (nestin and GFAP) and oligodendroglial (nestin and O4, CNP and PCNA) precursors. Double-stained cells were also counted under high-power view and tabulated over time.
PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium. RNA was isolated and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was run to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) change. Western blots were used to assess IL-7 protein change in the medium. Extracellular free Ca(2+) was removed by using Ca(2+)-free DMEM/F12 with 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid for 45 minutes before the start of hypoxia.
ESR was measured for 10 days in 46 patients (19 women and 27 men; mean age: 49.7 years; range: 13-70 years) who underwent elective craniotomy for tumor microsurgery (70-425 minutes with a mean of 230 minutes) under general anaesthesia. Blood samples were taken on the day before surgery and on each consecutive day after surgery for 10 days. The standard method of measuring ESR was based on the technique first described by Westergren.
Neural precursors isolated from rat embryonic mesencephalon (E13.5d) were transfected with vectors containing Nurr1 or Ret and treated with 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) and/or GDNF for 3 days. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry was used to test the expression of Nurr1 and Ret and the TH positive cells.
Single-voxel H-MRS was performed in a series of patients with different pathologies on a 1.5 T clinical scanner. Four areas of the brain were explored with the point resolved spectroscopy technique acquisition mode; the echo time was 35 milliseconds and the repetition time was 2000 milliseconds. We enrolled 15 patients for every area, and the intra-individual variations of metabolites were studied in two consecutive scans without removing the patient from the scanner. Curve fitting and analysis of metabolites were made with the software of GE and the LCModel. Spectra non-fulfilling the minimum criteria of quality in relation to linewidths and signal/noise ratio were rejected.

Intracarotid injection of 1 x 10(7) C6 glioma cells in Wistar rats was performed to establish a primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis model. Ki-67 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) immunohistochemistry staining were used to study the biological behavior of the developed tumor. Methodology, physical findings and histopathological features were also discussed.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde tract tracing was performed.
In neonate rats, the lower trunk of the left BP was cut. This nerve trunk was repaired either immediately [immediately-reconstructed group of rats (IR), or 30 days after, tardy reconstructed group of rats (TR)]; in the third group of animals, the nerve was not repaired (noreconstructed group of rats, NoR). In each group of animals, functional studies were performed at 90 days of age using the grooming test and the walking tracks analysis. Histologic studies of the C7-T1 spinal cord and lower trunk of BP were performed at 30 and 90 days of age; the numbers of motoneuron and axon were counted.
Between 1991 and 2002, 463 patients with an intracranial meningioma were operated in the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany. We compared the outcome of these patients after operation and the different methods of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the data from Buhl (1994), who analysed 661 patients with intracranial meningioma who were operated on in the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Essen, Essen, Germany, between 1968 and 1988, to find out whether better methods of diagnosis like magnetic resonance imaging scans, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, post-operative radiation therapy and chemotherapy have an influence on the recurrence and outcome after surgical treatment.
Fifty-three New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into three groups randomly. SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The treatment groups were as follows: (1) sham operated (no SAH (n=18); (2) SAH only (n=17); (3) SAH + TPM (n=18). Hippocampal sections were evaluated for neural tissue degeneration, using the previously described neural degeneration scoring system. The ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Serologicals Corp., former Intergen) was used to assess apoptosis in the hippocampal sections and the effect of TPM on the apoptotic response. Basilar artery lumen areas and arterial wall thickness were also measured in all groups.

Between 1996 and 2003, 137 patients (age between 6 weeks and 16 years) with unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction and no associated urological pathologies underwent Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty. A total of 112 patients were evaluated with complete data. One of the following criteria was considered to be indication for surgery in children with grade 4 hydronephrosis: differential renal function (DRF) &lt;40%; clinical symptoms such as pyolenephritis and flank pain; during follow-up renographies, a reduction of DRF &gt;10% and washout patterns II or III b according to O'Reilly. We looked at the age during surgery and the kind of presentation. DRF was measured using diuretic renography preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. A postoperative change in DRF of group A (children without CV, n = 84) was compared to that in group B (children with CV, n = 28).
After IRB approval (#105825), charts of patients identified by ICD-9 code as having colonic atresia, who were admitted to our institution between 1993 and 2008 were, retrospectively, reviewed. Particular attention was paid to demographic data, comorbidities, operative therapy, and complications. Continuous variables were compared using an unpaired t test. A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.
From 2000 to 2007, four children (3 males and 1 female) referred to our hospital for respiratory symptoms secondary to RTF.

All CVCs inserted in children with cancer at our Institution from October 2005 to January 2007 were prospectively monitored for device-related mechanical and infectious complications. The Sri Paran fixation technique was used in all cases. The complication rate per 1,000 days was calculated as 1,000 times the number of complications divided by the total number of catheter days.
Three longitudinal strips of colon were harvested from the mesenteric, anti-mesenteric and intermediate part in the whole length of resected colon of six patients with HSCR. Each strip was divided into two parts. One of the contiguous strips was assessed with HE and Hematoxylin-Phloxin-Safran, and the other one with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry. We analyzed the distribution of ganglion cells and nerve arrangement along the strips with both techniques and compared the results obtained in the three different regions of the bowel.
A total of 30 pregnant rabbits received fetal surgery on gestational day 23. A left diaphragmatic hernia was created in one end fetus (DH group) of each rabbit, and the other end fetus of the same rabbit received sham thoracotomy as control (CR group). Another 19 pregnant rabbits underwent partial resection of the diaphragm in both end fetuses on gestational day 23, and then artificial gastroschisis was performed on one end fetus (GS group) on gestational day 26, while the other end remained as control (CGS group). The fetuses were harvested on gestational day 30. The histological and morphometric evaluation of lungs and livers of the end fetuses in each group was conducted.

A series of experiments were conducted with a transcutaneous focused ultrasound device (UltraShape Contour I; UltraShape Inc., Yoqneam, Israel): (1) three-dimensional acoustic field distribution was measured by hydrophone in a water bath; (2) the real-time two-dimensional acoustic field was assessed using optical visualization by a Schlieren system; (3) three-dimensional and Schlieren results were compared in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms and in frozen specimens of porcine subcutaneous fat; and (4) a porcine in vivo preclinical model was used to test safety, selectivity, and efficacy by histological staining of excised skin and subcutaneous fat specimens.
The authors surveyed a cross-section of University of Michigan women who underwent postmastectomy breast reconstruction (response rate, 73 percent) between 1988 and 2006 [110 expander/implant and 109 transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) reconstructions]. Each group was stratified into three postreconstructive periods: short term (&lt;or=5 years), intermediate (6 to 8 years), and long term (&gt;8 years). Validated satisfaction items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale; scores were dichotomized into positive and negative responses. Logistic regression assessed satisfaction by procedure, while controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables.
The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts and mammograms of patients (n = 17; average follow-up, 6.3 years) who underwent the oncoplastic reduction technique before 2004. Mammography sensitivity was determined by measuring breast density, qualitative changes, and time until mammographic stabilization was determined. These data were compared with those of a control group from the same time period who underwent breast conservation therapy alone (n = 17; average follow-up, 5.9 years).
A total of 11 lower abdominal flaps were obtained from nine cadavers and two abdominoplasty procedures. The authors simulated the perfusion of seven pedicled TRAMs, eight full TRAMs, eight muscle-sparing TRAMs, 14 DIEPs, and six superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps. For each simulated flap, the named artery/perforator was injected with Omnipaque contrast using a Harvard precision pump at 0.5 ml/minute, and the flap was subjected to dynamic computed tomographic scanning using a GE Lightspeed 16-slice scanner. Scans were repeated at 0.125-ml increments (every 15 seconds) for the first 1 ml, then at 0.5-ml increments (every 60 seconds) for the next 2 to 3 ml, thus giving progressive computed tomographic images over time. Images were viewed using both General Electrics and TeraRecon systems, allowing analysis of branching patterns and perfusion flow as well as measurements of vascular territory.
Adipose-derived stromal cells were harvested from lipoaspiration specimens of patients undergoing elective suction-assisted lipoaspiration and third-generation ultrasound-assisted lipoaspiration. Harvested cells were seeded to evaluate proliferative capacity and in vitro osteogenic potential. Alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red staining were performed to evaluate early and terminal osteogenic differentiation, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to examine osteogenic gene expression patterns of RUNX2/CFBA1 (early differentiation) and osteocalcin (late differentiation).
The authors' method of fat harvesting and refinement has been described previously. The authors injected nude and tie2/lacZ mice with 2 ml of human lipoaspirate placed on the dorsal surface in a multipass, fan-like pattern. Fatty tissue was injected in small volumes of approximately 1/30 ml per withdrawal. The dorsal skin and associated fat was excised at various time points. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and cytochrome c oxidase IV. Transgenic tie2/lacZ samples were stained with X-galactosidase. At the 8-week time point, volumetric analysis was performed.
Eight smooth-surfaced tissue expanders were implanted into eight African green monkeys. In four experimental animals, a sheet of AlloDerm was draped over the tissue expander so as to cover the implant. Four control animals underwent placement of a tissue expander only. Animals were killed after 10 weeks and specimens underwent histologic and immunohistochemical analysis.
A computer-controlled device was used to stretch murine skin. C57Bl6 mice (n = 26) were assigned to a cyclical square-wave tensile stimulation for 4 hours or continuous stimulation for 4 hours. Stretched skin was analyzed for expression of the neuropeptides, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, their receptors (NK1R and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor component protein), and growth factors (nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor beta1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor) using immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

From April of 1999 to April of 2006, 33 patients with unilateral established facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation via latissimus dorsi free flap transplantation. Time from the onset of paralysis ranged from 20 months to 64 years (mean, 11.6 years). Patients were followed postoperatively for at least 24 months. Results were studied and compared using Terzis and Noah's 1997 classification.
Liposuction, fat injection, or a combination of both was performed on 30 patients between 1994 and 2006 at Roberto del Rio Hospital or Clinica Alemana, Santiago, Chile. Liposuction was indicated in patients with excessive amounts of fatty tissue or tumor-like swelling. Combined liposuction and lipoinjection was performed on patients with deficit and excess in soft tissues. Lipoinjection was used for patients with soft-tissue insufficiencies. Samples of fat obtained by liposuction were submitted to histopathologic examination. Traditional tumescent technique was used for liposuction. The supernatant obtained by simple filtration was used for fat injection. Short- and long-term postoperative follow-up included registration of complications and assessment of aesthetic and functional outcome. The kappa test was used for statistical analysis.
The records of 160 consecutive hemipelvectomy patients from the authors' institution were reviewed to identify the incidence of soft-tissue coverage problems and approaches to their management.
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Patients undergoing bilateral breast reconstruction with tissue expanders had one incision randomized to dermal closure with absorbable dermal staples. The contralateral side was closed with dermal sutures. During the expansion period, wounds were assessed by a blinded plastic surgeon using the 13-point Vancouver Scar Scale. At the time of implant exchange, both scars were excised and examined for histologic signs of inflammation.
This retrospective review analyzed 973 patients who had undergone anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction for various soft-tissue defects over the past 10 years. Various types of complicated defects in 36 patients were reconstructed with a composite anterolateral thigh flap combined with vascularized fascia lata. The fascia lata component of the flap was used for abdominal wall and fascial defect reconstruction in 12 patients, for lip-cheek defect reconstruction in 15 patients, for reconstruction of composite defects in extremities in nine patients, and for reconstruction of the perineum in one patient. Functional outcomes of donor sites were investigated by using a dynamometer.
The anatomical study was performed on 23 fixed and injected cadavers. The perforators of the tensor fasciae latae were identified and classified as septocutaneous or musculocutaneous. Diameter, location, and numbers were measured and the perforators were dissected up to their origin. The injection study was performed on 10 fresh cadavers. On one side, the ascending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery was injected with methylene blue; on the other side, the septocutaneous perforators were injected selectively. The size, location, and borders of the stained skin were measured.
A retrospective study focused on patient outcomes was performed on 19 patients diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon. Patients suffered from chronic ischemic hand pain. All patients had vascular studies to rule out occlusive disease. Fifty to 100 units of Botox were injected into the palm around each involved neurovascular bundle. Preinjection and postinjection laser Doppler scanning was performed on most patients to measure blood flow.
Eighteen adult patients with zone 2 flexor tendon injuries (34 digits) were studied prospectively for up to 3 years. Tendons were repaired using the modified Kessler technique and marked with stainless steel wire. Botulinum toxin was injected into the appropriate proximal flexor muscle belly under localizing electromyographic control. A matched cohort consisted of 53 patients (104 digits).
The long-term outcomes of 14 patients treated for this condition were evaluated. Comparisons of late postoperative to preoperative and early postoperative measurements were performed for digital brachial index. Subjective symptoms and function impairment were compared for preoperative and postoperative states using validated questionnaires. Comparisons were also made based on ulnar artery patency versus occlusion at late postoperative measurement.
A retrospective study evaluated the complication rate using the Harmonic blade in face and neck lifting (n = 420) between 2001 and 2007.

Tests for associations using multi-marker haplotypes were performed using the statistics environment "R".
The SOHO study is a 3-year, prospective, observational study of 10,972 outpatients with schizophrenia across 10 European countries. The cost of resource use (inpatient stay, day care, psychiatrist visits and medication) for those who ever relapsed in three years was compared to those who never relapsed. One-year costs for both groups were also compared for a more stringent comparison. The analyses were adjusted for patient characteristics and took account of non-normality of the cost data by using a log-link function. UK unit costs were applied to resource use. The analysis was repeated after multiple imputation for missing data.

Clinical records of patients diagnosed with non-epithelial breast malignancies were then reviewed for data regarding patient demographics, clinical presentation, pre-operative investigations, operative findings and outcome. Pathology reports were examined carefully for tumour type, location and for evidence of lymphovascular spread. This data was compared with the available literature.
From 1996 to 2006, 219 consecutive patients underwent inguinal hernia repair - 92 using a standard Lichtenstein repair and 127 with a Kugel patch. Patient characteristics, length of postoperative hospital stay and complication rates were assessed by retrospective review of the notes. Recurrence and chronic groin pain were assessed by postal questionnaire (with a follow up by telephone interview for non-responders). Patients with symptoms or an apparent groin swelling were reassessed by one of the authors (BD).
A thirty-four year old female was referred to our Head and Neck clinic with a one-month history of left posterior triangle lymphadenopathy. She reported no other symptoms and haematological investigations were normal. She was "Red Flagged" as a possible lymphoma. Excision biopsy revealed extensive histiocytic necrotising lymphadenitis providing a diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.
From January 2005 through September 2007, 217 patients underwent TTMB. The inclusion criteria included a persistently elevated PSA level and/or diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on previous biopsy. The prostate gland was arbitrarily divided into 24 regions, and a median of 58 cores were obtained per patient. The patients were divided into 3 velocity cohorts according to the following changes in PSA level in the year before biopsy: &lt; or =0.0, 0.1-1.9, and &gt; or =2.0 ng/mL. The PSAV was evaluated as a predictor for prostate cancer diagnosis, Gleason score, tumor volume, and cancer location.
Adenoviral vector encoding the human survivin gene was generated. Human DCs from healthy donors were transduced with human survivin gene by infection with adenoviral vector encoding the human survivin gene using the centrifugal method. Survivin-specific CTLs were induced from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells by DCs transduced with the survivin gene. The ability of CTLs to lyse cancer cell lines was assessed using the (51)Cr-release assay.
Testosterone (0.1-300 microM) was added cumulatively to organ baths after precontraction of isolated human corpus cavernosum strips (n = 5) with KCl (45 mM). Testosterone-induced responses were tested in the presence of nonselective, large, conductance Ca(2+)-activated and voltage-sensitive K(+) channel inhibitor tetraethylammonium (1 mM), adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K(+) channel inhibitor glibenclamide (10 microM), voltage-dependent inward rectifier K(+) channel inhibitor barium chloride (30 microM) and voltage-sensitive K(+) channel inhibitor 4-aminopyridine (1 mM).
Urine, vaginal, and urethral samples obtained from 153 women presenting with chronic voiding symptoms were tested for the presence of pathogens including U. urealyticum and M. hominis. Patients with positive cultures for Mycoplasma were treated with a single dose of 1 g azithromycin and followed up 1 month after therapy. Patients with persistent infection received 100 mg doxycycline orally, twice daily for 7 days, according to the results of the susceptibility test. The patients were asked to rate the severity of their symptoms at their initial visit and after treatment.
A retrospective evaluation of a prospectively maintained radical cystectomy database consisting of the data from 344 patients was performed. Cox regression analysis was done, and Kaplan-Meier tables were developed to evaluate the contribution of this finding to clinical outcomes.
A total of 355 patients with Stage 1 or 2 hypertension and LUTS (as defined by an International Prostate Symptom Score of &gt; or =10) were randomly assigned to receive 2 mg of terazosin (n = 117), 5 mg of Amlodipine (n = 119), or 5 mg of Amlodipine plus 2 mg of terazosin (n = 119) once daily for a total of 28 days. The primary outcomes were a reduction in the total and subscores of the International Prostate Symptom Score and blood pressure. Analyses were performed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT00693199).
The effects of gefitinib on the activation status of EGFR and kinases downstream in its signaling cascade were examined in three gefitinib-resistant RCC cell lines: SKRC-44, KU20-01, and 786-O. The changes in signaling cascades and cell survival that were induced by gefitinib in combination with either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or the knockdown of Akt expression by transient transfection with Akt small interfering RNA were examined in 786-O cells.
HCC strips were mounted in 10-mL organ baths containing Krebs solution and connected to force-displacement transducers. The changes in isometric force were recorded using the Powerlab 400 data acquisition system. Corporeal smooth muscle was precontracted submaximally with phenylephrine (10 micromol/L).
A survey-based study of personnel returning from deployment to Southwest Asia was performed. The demographics were compared between the personnel reporting a history of urolithiasis during or within the first 90 days of returning from deployment and the personnel without a history of reported urolithiasis.
We studied the archeologic and artistic evidence regarding human representations performed during the Upper Paleolithic period, 38,000 to 11,000 years BCE, in Europe, with a focus on genital male representations in portable and rock art.
Fifty TSW who were at least 6 months' posttransition were recruited in a University Hospital. Speculum examination and digital vaginal examination were performed by a gynecologist. Transvaginal ultrasound of the prostate was performed by a radiologist. The information gathered included: ease of insertion of the speculum, vaginal length, palpability of the prostate, vaginal mobility and presence of scar tissue, ease of introduction of the ultrasound probe, ability to visualize prostate and seminal vesicles, echogenicity of the peripheral zone and the central gland, presence of calcifications and delineation of prostatic capsule, attitude toward gynecologic examinations, and anticipated and experienced painfulness of the different examinations.
The patients who underwent CTURVP were divided into those receiving only room temperature irrigation solution (group 1, 75 patients) or warm irrigation solution with a system maintaining the temperature of the ventral penile skin at about 36 degrees C continuously (group 2, 78 patients). At follow-up, 1, 3, and 6 months later, the International Prostate Symptom Score and peak urine flow rate were evaluated.
We retrospectively examined the records of all infants hospitalized for UTI at our institution, a free-standing children's hospital in the United States, for a 10-year period. Race, sex, and subsequent urologic diagnosis (using codes from the 9(th) edition of the International Classification of Diseases [ICD-9] were tabulated. Individual charts were reviewed to confirm documentation and workup of UTI.
From October 2000 to December 2006, 1308 consecutive men underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy by a single surgeon. Of these 1308 men, 331 (25.3%) met our criteria for having "extremely" low-risk disease as determined by the preoperative and pathologic factors, including a preoperative PSA level &lt;10 ng/mL, clinical Stage T1c or T2a, a Gleason score of &lt; or =6, an estimated cancer volume in the specimen of &lt;5%, and no evidence of positive surgical margins. This cohort was selected because any measurable PSA level would be highly suspicious for a benign origin. Undetectable PSA was defined as a PSA level of &lt; or =0.04 ng/mL. A measurable PSA level included values between 0.05 and 0.14 ng/mL on &gt; or =2 consecutive measurements 6 months apart. Biochemical recurrence was defined as 3 consecutively increasing PSA levels with a peak level of &gt; or =0.15 ng/mL.
The Food and Drug Administration's medical device complication database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database (MAUDE), was evaluated for pure and hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomies from 1992 to 2007 with the broadest keywords possible. In an attempt to estimate the failure rates by device type, a "denominator of use" was calculated using Organ Procurement and Transplant Network data multiplied by previously published survey-determined usage rates.
We performed a retrospective analysis of 619 patients with first-time calcium stone formation (SF) with complete metabolic assessments, who had been diagnosed and treated from 1994 to 2007 at our institution. Patients with SF were categorized into 2 groups according to the date of initial diagnosis: group 1 (1994-1999, n = 353 [57.0%]) and group 2 (2000-2007, n = 266 [43%]).
The study examined inpatient admissions for pediatric urolithiasis in 2003, using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database. We used the International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, Clinical Modification codes, to identify patients with a principal diagnosis of renal (592.0) or ureteral (592.1) calculi. Sex prevalence was assessed, and the results were stratified by age group.
An avascular plane of tissue from coagulation necrosis was achieved with the Habib 4X radiofrequency ablation device and the Rita 1500X generator. Typically, we used a power setting of 50 W but have found settings as low as 25 W necessary to provide hemostasis for larger vessels. The tumor was then sharply excised with a negative margin using robotic scissors and electrocautery to facilitate tissue cutting. Retrograde injection of methylthioninium chloride and saline through an externalized ureteral catheter allowed for precise sutured closure of the collecting system. FloSeal and BioGlue were then applied, making surgical bolsters or parenchymal sutures unnecessary. Intraoperative histologic evaluation of the surgical margin and repeat resection of the tumor bed was possible because the renal hilum was not clamped, and no warm ischemia was used.
From 1990 to 2007, 225 patients with renal tumors and inferior vena cava thrombus underwent RNIVCT, including 135 patients who had undergone preoperative renal artery embolization and 90 patients who had not. The effect of embolization on perioperative morbidity and mortality, transfusion requirements, blood loss, and operative time was analyzed by comparing the 2 groups.
Our prospective study included 24 children &lt;14 years old with radiopaque renal stones &gt;25 mm treated by ESWL as first-line treatment using the electromagnetic Dornier DoLi S device. Pretreatment kidney, ureter, and bladder plain films and intravenous urography and post-treatment ultrasonography and kidney, ureter, and bladder plain films were used to monitor the clearance of fragments. Stone clearance was assessed at 1 and 3 months. A stone-free state was defined as no radiologic evidence of stone. Asymptomatic noninfectious and nonobstructive fragments &lt;3 mm were considered insignificant.
During September 2006, men younger than 75 years of age living in the Washington, DC area were invited to participate in the George Washington University Prostate Cancer Screening Program. The SHIM questionnaire was administered to all participants. Information regarding primary care physician use, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor use, serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and digital rectal examination findings was also obtained. Those who registered SHIM scores of 17 or less or who were taking a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor were considered to have ED.
We performed a review of patients who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP; n = 343), holmium laser resection of the prostate (HoLRP; n = 54), or open prostatectomy (OP; n = 68). The PSA and PSA velocity values were collected at regular intervals both pre- and postoperatively for all patients. Only patients with histologic BPH and those with incidental CaP who underwent a watchful waiting strategy were included.
Data were obtained from the 2006 U.S. National Health and Wellness Survey. Cases (those who reported experiencing a sudden overwhelming urge to urinate, a frequent urge to urinate, or urinating &gt;8 times/d) were matched 1:1 with controls (those not experiencing any symptoms) by age, race, sex, educational attainment, and comorbidity status. The outcome measures assessed included health resource use, work productivity loss/activity impairment, and health-related quality of life.
White men, aged 40-79 years, were randomly selected in 1990 and assessed for alpha-blocker use and LUTS severity. Sexual function was assessed using the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory. Men who used alpha-blockers before any sexual dysfunction were considered "exposed." Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated separately for each sexual function domain using Cox proportional hazard models.
We retrospectively identified patients undergoing attempted retrograde ureteral access after urinary diversion surgery. The demographic information, diversion type, indication for retrograde access, success or failure of access, and intra- and postoperative complications were recorded.
A total of 156 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms who had indications for open prostatectomy were enrolled in the study from September 2004 to January 2006. Of the patients, 78 underwent open prostatectomy with suturing at the prostatic vesical junction (group 1) and 78 were treated with urethral catheter traction to control bleeding (group 2). The duration of operation, duration of hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, hemoglobin decrease, and weight of resected prostate were recorded in both groups. Three months later, we followed up patients with the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire, maximal flow rate measurement, and cystoscopic examination.
Our study included 120 patients who had attended our clinic and were diagnosed with idiopathic infertility according to medical history and physical and seminal examination findings, as initial evaluations. The patients were divided randomly into 2 groups. Those in the study group (60 men) were given NAC (600 mg/d orally) for 3 months; the control group (60 men) received a placebo. The oxidative status was determined by measuring the total antioxidant capacity, total peroxide and oxidative stress index in plasma samples. The sperm parameters were evaluated after NAC treatment and were compared with those in the control group.
Bilateral no-scalpel vasectomy was performed in 323 patients during 2007. Of the 323 patients, 65 received LIA, 29 received LIA + SCB, and 227 received anesthesia using the no-needle technique with the MadaJet device. The level of pain during anesthesia administration and the subsequent procedural pain was documented for each technique using a pain scale of 0-10.
A case-control study was conducted to test the association between metabolic syndrome features and prostate cancer among 637 patients and 244 controls, with African-American men constituting 43% of the study population.
A retrospective clinical record review was performed of 68 patients treated from March 1998 to July 2007. Group 1 (n = 45) had UGTB confirmed by microbiologic or histologic examination. Group 2 (n = 23) had a high suspicion of UGTB because of the clinical features, but no microbiologic or histologic confirmation. The data were collected and statistically analyzed using Student's t test for parametric data and Fisher's exact test for contingency tables (P &lt; .05 was accepted as statistically significant).
Since November 2005, 3 patients with symptomatic CU have undergone laparoscopic repair of their anomaly at our institutes. In all 3 cases, the ureter was transected and positioned anteriorly with an end-to-end anastomosis. In 2 cases, the retrocavally located ureteral segment was resected.
The retrospective data from 1339 patients who had undergone transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy from November 2003 to June 2008 were reviewed. An automatic biopsy gun with an 18-gauge needle was used to obtain 10-core biopsies for first biopsies and &gt; or =12-core for repeat biopsies. These patients had received 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for 5 days, beginning 24 hours before biopsy. All biopsies were performed as outpatient procedures.
From June 2007 to April 2008, 5 patients with congenital vaginal absence and 1 patient with a total vaginectomy defect after ablative surgery underwent total vaginal reconstruction with pedicled DIEP flaps. Preoperative mapping of the perforators was performed using enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning with three-dimensional reconstruction. The desired perforators were selected according to their diameters and intramuscular courses. The vertically oriented DIEP flaps were then raised and tubed to form the neovagina, which was brought to the prerectal pocket through a retropubic tunnel.
A 57-year-old woman with hypertension, right-sided flank pain, and radiographic evidence of an atrophic right kidney consented for NOTES transvaginal nephrectomy. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved with a Veress needle inserted deep in the umbilicus. Under direct vision, a colpotomy was made and a transvaginal port positioned. Using standard and articulating operating instruments inserted transvaginally, the kidney was mobilized and the renal hilum was controlled with an endovascular stapler. The kidney was placed in a laparoscopic retrieval bag and extracted through the vaginal incision. Salient demographic and operative data were obtained.
A total of 36 samples were selected from 888 adult patients residing in S√£o Paulo who had previously been diagnosed in two independent studies in our laboratory as being infected with subclade F1 based on pol subgenomic fragment sequencing. Proviral DNA was amplified from the purified genomic DNA of all 36 blood samples by 5 fragments overlapping PCR followed by direct sequencing. Sequence data were obtained from the 5 fragments of pure subclade F1 and phylogenetic trees were constructed and compared with previously published sequences. Subclades F1 that exhibited mosaic structure with other subtypes were omitted from any further analysis
The study was conducted with three different groups of participants: patients waiting for liver transplantation (N = 31 in joint evaluation and N = 30 in each of the two separate evaluation conditions); students (N = 30 in join evaluation and N = 30 in each of the two separate evaluation conditions); and healthy adults (N = 30 in joint evaluation and N = 30 in each of the two separate evaluation conditions). Participants were presented with hypothetical scenarios and asked how good (or bad) were their feelings toward one or two types of donor (e.g., human and pig).
Lewis rat islets or skin was transplanted into wild type B6 mice or into B6 mice that were Jalpha18(null), CD1(null), or beta2 microglobulin (beta2M)(null) NK 1.1 depleted, or perforin(null). Graft recipients were pretreated with an infusion of donor derived spleen cells and a brief course of anti-CD154 mAb treatments. Additional groups received mAb or cells only.
We examined whether human sequences in chimeric mice could be measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1 repeat element, sex-determining region Y, or short tandem repeats (STR) across human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions, which are distinct from rodent genomes.
Streptozotocin-treated (50 mg/kg) monkeys (n = 12, follow-up of 6 to 231 days) were compared with non-diabetic animals (n = 5; follow-up, 180 days). Metabolic [fasting and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) for serum levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon] and morphologic (endocrine volume density and cell mass for insulin and glucagon) were compared between non-diabetic and diabetic animals. Six additional diabetic primates were given transplants of 15 000 adult pig islet equivalents without immunosuppression to monitor glucose, glucagon, insulin, and porcine C-peptide levels until 48 h after transplantation.
Here, the combination of nuclear transfer cloning and RNAi technology was used to produce pigs that may not propagate PERV. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were expressed as short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against the gag and pol PERV genes, respectively, under the control of a RNA polymerase III (pol III), or a pol II promoter. PERV gag and pol model-genes, in combination with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter system, were developed to assess in vitro PERV target knockdown. Two shRNAs were selected, and transgenic pigs were produced that expressed the anti-gag and -pol shRNAs, in tandem, under the control of a ubiquitous pol II promoter.
The TY8000 servo-handle tension test machine was used to measure biomechanical indices, such as bending stiffness, radial pedestal, and stress-straining. The residual stress and bursting strength of adult-excised porcine trachea was evaluated.

Infertile couples who have applied to IVF were admitted into this study when the male partner's sperm concentration was &gt; 20 x 10(6)/mL and motility &gt; 30%. Pre- and post swim-up semen quality parameters including concentration, motility, sperm morphology and AI were evaluated in a prospective, randomized and blinded fashion. The couples were divided prospectively into 2 groups. In group I (25 couples) 50 000 sperm per oocyte were used for insemination considering post swim-up acrosome index, and in group II (25 couples) 50 000 sperm per oocyte were used for insemination without considering post swim-up acrosome index.
Six female cynomolgus monkeys, aged 17-21 years, were randomized into 2 groups by the stratified weight: the OVX and sham-operation groups (n = 3 in each group). The experimental period was 16 months. Lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in vivo and serum and urinary bone turnover markers were longitudinally measured, and peripheral quantitative computed tomographic and bone histomorphometric analyses were performed on trabecular bone of the lumbar vertebra, femoral neck, and distal radius at the end of the experiment.
The patients in this study were followed up prospectively in preoperative and postoperative 12 months periods. The 20 ophthalmologists in 14 hospitals were asked to refer about 20 patients who were scheduled to undergo cataract surgery from March and June of 1997. A multiple regression analysis was used to identify the degree of the appropriate surgery associated with the changes of outcomes. The outcomes were designed as the clinical and functional outcomes (visual acuity, visual function, satisfaction with vision, and satisfaction with overall care).
Ligamentum flavum tissues were harvested from OLF and non-OLF patients during surgery. OLF and non-OLF cells were isolated from explant cultures. Cultured cells were analyzed using immunofluorescence staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Seven adult, 20 kg mongrel dogs underwent evoked response laryngeal electromyography under 0.5 to 1.0 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) isoflurane anesthesia.

There were 86 patients operated by the Er-YAG laser stapedotomy from 2001 to 2007 were analyzed retrospectively, with 23 male, 63 female and 13 double ears and with the average age of 48 years old, ranging from 12 to 78. All of 99 ears suffered deafness of conduction. The average air-bone-gap (ABG) of all patients before surgery was (37.4+/-9.0) dB HL (ranging from 13.7 to 58.7 dB). The patients followed-up over 6 weeks after the surgery was regarded as the short-term result, while over one year follow-up as the long-term effect (according to the standard of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery). The followed-up average time was (26.3+/-15.8) months (range from 14 to 73 months). The pre-post-operation average bone conduction auditory threshold of 2 kHz and 4 kHz were observed. The data of the patient whether or not has the symptoms of tinnitus and dizzy and the lasted days were also recorded.

Thirty nine cases of cervical chylous leakage from June 1992 to June 2008 were retrospectively analyzed in this hospital. All of the 39 cases were cured by treating with conservative individualized therapy, including the applying of diet with high calorie, high protein and low fat and fatty food should only contains medium-chain triglycerides, total parenteral nutrition, keep the balance of hydrogen and electrolyte and correct hypoproteinemia, local pressure dressing, high persistent vacuum drainage (-50 approximately -80 kPa) and/or somatostatin analogue.
AR model in guinea pigs was established by using ovalbumin. The animals were divided into three groups. Group one was sensitized continuously by ovalbumin, group two was treated with Hemin as induction group, and group three was treated with zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) as suppression group. The guinea pigs treated with saline were used as control. The behavior science scores, eotaxin concentration of nasal lavage, IgE in blood serum were recorded, and the plasma concentrations of CO and H2S were determined, then the expression of hemeoxygenase (HO)-1, cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) were measured in nasal mucosa by fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR.
The expression of Ang-1, Ang-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD34 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were studied in 62 human OSCCs, 30 adjacent noncancerous oral tissues and 10 normal oral mucosa by conventional immunohistochemistry. Microvessel density (MVD) and vessel maturation index (VMI) were also assessed with double-labeling immunohistochemistry staining against CD34, a marker of pan-endothelial cells, and that against alpha-SMA, a marker of mural cells (pericytes/smooth muscle cells). The images were analyzed with BioMias system.
HepG2 cells were Implanted into the liver of nude mice. The implanted mice were then treated with SRL and tacrolimus (FK506). The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected by immunohistology, microvessel density (MVD) was counted by immunostaining with anti-CD34 antibody for endothelial cells. Tumor apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay.
22 cases of HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombus were devided into 2 groups: 10 patients (group A) recieved stent implantation in combination with conformal radiation therapy, 12 patients (group B) recieved stent implantation and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. The adverse reactions, and liver function before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. The stent patency rate at 4, 6 and 12 months and the survival rate at 3, 6 and 12 months were followed up. Comparison of liver function was analyzed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Comparison of stent patency rate curves and survival curves was analyzed by Log rank test.

Serum was collected from 161 patients with colorectal cancer and 26 healthy volunteers. Cancer tissue was collected from 128 patients. The level of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in serum and cancer tissue was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
This is a single-center, prospective study. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether adenoma detection rates differed between procedures with or without trainee involvement. A total of 368 consecutive patients entered the analysis (181 with trainee participation and 187 without).
A PubMed search was performed for publications between 1990 and May 2008. The terms acute, perforated, diverticulitis, lavage, drainage, and laparoscopy were used in combination. The EMBASE and Cochrane databases were also searched.
Between 2004 and 2007 sera of 1323 10-years old children in Baden W√ºrttemberg were tested in-vitro for specific IgE-antibodies against common aeroallergens including ragweed pollen.
A 44-year-old woman was referred to the emergency department for acute paraumbilical abdominal pain with colics. 5 days previously, a tooth extraction had been performed and postoperatively ibuprofen had been prescribed for pain relief. The medical history was empty besides a penicillin allergy and two caesarean sections 20 and 21 years ago.
The physical examination revealed paraumbilical pain on palpation. Abdominal ultrasound could identify some free fluid and an aperistaltic intestinal loop as well as an echo-rich structure in the hypogastric region. An abdominal CT scan showed a hypodense tubular structure of 6.5 x 3.3 cm indicating a possible ischaemic intestinal segment, and a dilated intestinal loop as well as an uterus myomatosis. Due to therapy refractory symptoms and increasing leucocytes on the second day after admission, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed.
Intraoperatively, a volvulus of the ileum as well as an adhesive strangulation of the small intestine could be identified.
Consecutively, surgery with an ileocoecal resection and a side-to-side ileotransversostomy was performed. Within a few days, the patient recovered completely and resumed normal activities of daily living.
Twenty adult CI users were evaluated on an objective test of speech recognition in noise (Bamford-Kowal-Bench Sentences in Noise [BKB-SIN] test) and a measure of noise tolerance (Acceptable Noise Level [ANL] test) and completed a self-report measure of communication difficulty (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit [APHAB]). Relationships between BKB-SIN scores, ANL scores, and aided APHAB scores for the ease of communication, background noise, reverberation, and Global scales were assessed. In addition, BKB-SIN scores and ANL scores for the CI users were compared with scores for a control group of 23 NH listeners.
Thresholds from 25 listeners were obtained using pulsed, warbled, and pulsed-warbled tones at test frequencies recommended by ASHA.
ER measurements at ambient pressure were made on five human cadaver ears in three conditions: (1) baseline with intact ossicular chain, (2) with the ossicular chain cut using an argon laser, and (3) with the ossicular chain repaired. Laser Doppler vibrometry measurements of stapes footplate velocity were also made in the three conditions to monitor the effect of the experimental manipulations on sound transfer through the middle ear.
The investigation entailed a randomized, repeated-measures design of 15 older adults (59 to 82 yr) with bilateral sensorineural hearing losses who wore HAs. Participants viewed three types of televised programs (news, drama, and game show) that were each edited into lists of speech segments and provided an identification response. Each participant was tested in four conditions: baseline (no HA or CC), HA only, CC only, and HA + CC. Also, pilot testing with young normal-hearing listeners was conducted to establish list equivalence and stimulus intelligibility with a control group. All testing was conducted in a quiet room to simulate a living room, using a 20 in flat screen television. Questionnaires were also administered to participants to determine the frequency of HA and CC use while watching television.
Existing data from more than 1200 ears were used to analyze BCR as a function of Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) level. These data were selected because both audiometric and DPOAE data were available on every ear. Although these data were not obtained in newborns, this compromise was necessary because audiometric outcomes (especially in infants with congenital hearing loss) in neonates are either lacking or limited in number. As such, it is important to note that the characteristics of responses from the group of subjects that formed the bases of the present analyses are different from those for neonates. This limits the extent to which actual criterion levels can be selected but should not affect the general approach of using BCR as a framework for considering UNHS criteria. Estimates of the prevalence of congenital hearing loss identified through UNHS in 37 states and U.S. territories in 2004 were used to calculate BCR. A range of estimates for the lifetime monetary benefits and yearly costs for UNHS were used, based on data available in the literature. Still, exact benefits and costs are difficult to know. Both one-step (DPOAE alone) and two-step (DPOAE followed by automated auditory brainstem response, AABR) screening paradigms were considered in the calculation of BCR. The influence of middle ear effusion was simulated by incorporating a range of expected DPOAE level reductions into an additional BCR analyses
Participants were 17 native English speaking adults with postlingual deafness. All subjects received the Nucleus 24 Contour implant in both ears, either during the same surgery or during two separate surgeries that were no more than 1 mo apart. Both devices for each subject were activated at the same time, regardless of surgical approach. Speech intelligibility was measured at 3 and 6 mo after activation. Target speech was presented at 0 degrees in front. Testing was conducted in quiet and in the presence of four-talker babble. The babble was located on the right, on the left, or in front (colocated with the target). Sound localization abilities were measured at the 3 mo interval. All testing was conducted under three listening modes: left ear alone, right ear alone, or bilateral.
Forty-two cochlear implant subjects were recruited from the University of Washington Medical Center cochlear implant program and referred by two implant manufacturers. Ten normal-hearing volunteers were drawn from the University of Washington Medical Center and associated campuses. A computer-driven, self-administered test was developed to examine three specific aspects of music perception: pitch direction discrimination, melody recognition, and timbre recognition. The pitch subtest used an adaptive procedure to determine just-noticeable differences for complex tone pitch direction discrimination within the range of 1 to 12 semitones. The melody and timbre subtests assessed recognition of 12 commonly known melodies played with complex tones in an isochronous manner and eight musical instruments playing an identical five-note sequence, respectively. Testing was repeated for cochlear implant subjects to evaluate test-retest reliability. Normal-hearing volunteers were also tested to demonstrate differences in performance in the two populations.
Forty-eight participants who had at least a high school education and who hold salaried positions participated in one of seven focus groups. Participants first answered questions about a hypothetical executive who had hearing loss and considered how she might react to various communication issues. They then addressed questions about their own work-related predicaments. The sessions were audiovideo recorded and later transcribed for analysis.
The Spatial Hearing Questionnaire, composed of 24 items, is scored from 0 to 100. It was administered to 142 subjects using one or two cochlear implants. Speech perception and localization abilities were measured, and the Speech, Spatial, and Other Qualities questionnaire was completed to evaluate validity of the questionnaire. Psychometric tests were performed to test the reliability and factor structure of the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire.
A total of 102 (67 trained musicians, 35 nonmusicians) right-handed young women with normal hearing participated in three auditory stimulus conditions: pure tones (25 musicians/15 nonmusicians), harmonic tones (42 musicians/20 nonmusicians), and speech syllables (26 musicians/15 nonmusicians). Pure tone and harmonic tone stimuli were presented in multideviant oddball paradigms designed to elicit MMN and P3a. Each paradigm included one standard and two infrequently occurring deviants. For the pure tone condition, the standard pure tone was 1000 Hz, and the two deviant tones differed in frequency from the standard by either 1.5% (1015 Hz) or 6% (1060 Hz). The harmonic tone complexes were digitally created and contained a fundamental frequency (F0) and three harmonics. The amplitude of each harmonic was divided by its harmonic number to create a natural amplitude contour in the frequency spectrum. The standard tone was G4 (F0 = 392 Hz), and the two deviant tones differed in fundamental frequency from the standard by 1.5% (F0 = 386 Hz) or 6% (F0 = 370 Hz). The fundamental frequencies of the harmonic tones occur within the average female vocal range. The third condition to elicit MMN and P3a was designed for the presentation of speech syllables (/ba/ and /da/) and was structured as a traditional oddball paradigm (one standard/one infrequent deviant). Each speech stimulus was presented as a standard and a deviant in separate blocks. P1-N1-P2 was elicited before each oddball task by presenting each auditory stimulus alone in single blocks. All cortical auditory evoked potentials were recorded in a passive listening condition.
Core elements of this position paper are the definitions of important terms like monitoring, exposure monitoring, effect monitoring, and integrated monitoring. Moreover, temporal and spatial aspects (monitoring of spatial distributions, trend monitoring, and retrospective monitoring) and their applications are discussed. The main focus of this position paper is the coverage of aspects which have to be observed for the preparation and implementation of a monitoring program. Essential is the clear specification of the targets of the monitoring which determine the development of the monitoring concept and its realization, e.g., if environmental media (compartments) or organisms are most appropriate as samples for the aim of the study. Of course, also the properties of the target substances are important (e.g., lipophilicity/bioaccumulation as pre-requisite for an exposure monitoring with organisms). Finally, the monitoring phases of sample planning, sampling, storage and transport of samples, selection of analytical methods, quality assurance measures as well as reporting are discussed.
This study was conducted to investigate the environmental behavior and long-term trends of toxic metals in Seoul and Busan, the two most populated cities of Korea, from 1991 to 2004. To this end, the concentrations of five toxic metals (including Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, and Ni) in TSP (total suspended particle) fractions were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. The analysis of long-term patterns of metal concentration data was conducted using two different temporal grouping criteria for both the full study period (1991-2004) and the second half (1998-2004). The statistical significance of such variabilities was assessed through a comparison with relevant reference data from other areas of the world.
The sorption-desorption of acetochlor, using the batch equilibration method, was studied on eight surface soils, one subsurface soil and five sediments collected from the Laborec River and three water reservoirs. Soils and sediments were characterized by commonly used methods for their total organic carbon content, distribution of humus components, pH, grain-size distribution, and smectite content, and for calcium carbonate content. The effect of soil/sediment characteristics on acetochlor sorption-desorption was examined by simple correlation analysis.
To address these questions, we have used the CALUX AhR agonist bioassay and the Comet genotoxicity bioassay with RTL-W1 cells to evaluate the toxic potential of different extracts from a PAH-contaminated soil undergoing large-scale bioremediation. The extracts were also chemically analyzed for PAH16 and PCDD/PCDF. Soil sampled on five occasions between day 0 and day 274 of biological treatment was shaken with n-butanol with vortex mixing at room temperature to determine the bioavailable fraction of contaminants. To establish total concentrations, parts of the same samples were extracted using an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE) with toluene at 100 degrees C. The extracts were tested as inducers of AhR-dependent luciferase activity in the CALUX assay and for DNA breakage potential in the Comet bioassay.
The occurrence of the antihistamines cetirizine, acrivastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine in sewage treatment plants wastewaters and in recipient river waters was studied. The analytical procedure consisted of solid-phase extraction of the water samples followed by liquid chromatography separation and detection by a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in the multiple reaction mode.
Element loads of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn) measured in the French campaign 2006 were aggregated to a multi-metal index (MMI). This index was first introduced in the German moss surveys and represents the mean rank of each monitoring site or estimated raster cell regarding all elements referred to. Hence, the spatial variability of the metal bioaccumulation in France could be assessed as a whole. A comparison of the MMI map with the spatial patterns of the Cu loads in mosses was then drawn, as Cu originates to a large extent from urban sources. Applying CHAID, the MMI and the Cu loads in the mosses were further investigated with regard to confounding factors. The said results were discussed on the basis of recent scientific publications.
The improved heavy metal resistance also makes the investigated tobacco clones interesting for understanding the plant defense enzyme system in general. Freshly harvested plant material (N. tabacum leaves) was used to investigate the antioxidative cascade in plants grown on heavy metal contaminated sites with and without amendments of different ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate fertilizers.
Plants were grown on heavily polluted soils in north-east Switzerland. Leaves were harvested at the field site and directly deep frozen in liquid N(2). Studies were concentrated on the antioxidative enzymes of the Halliwell-Asada cycle, and spectrophotometric measurements of catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), glutathione peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.9), glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2), glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) were performed.
This article is based on a secondary analysis of findings and perspectives reported in the literature and on the methods of qualitative social empirical research, i.e., interviews with experts. A total number of 34 interviews were conducted to explore the different strategies of handling non-knowledge and constructing evidence. Actors from science, administration, business and NGOs were interviewed. In this way, typical epistemic cultures can be described. An epistemic culture is the constellation of methodological strategies, theoretical assumptions and practical-experimental settings which define in every speciality the ways how we know what we know.
We based our review on classical and recent findings from the fields of biogeochemistry and microbial ecology, highlighting some odd results from highly humic Brazilian tropical lagoons, which can reach up to 160 mg C L(-1).
The potential of HYP to generate AOX was determined in laboratory-scale experiments. Different model solutions were treated with HYP according to disinfection processes in viticulture and conditions of AOX formation in effluents were simulated. AOX were quantified using the flask-shaking method and identified DBPs were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
The yeast estrogen screen (YES) was adapted so that toxicity and estrogenicity could be quantified simultaneously in one experimental run. Mercury, two organic solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 2,4-dinitroaniline), a surfactant (LAS-12) and the antibiotic cycloheximide were selected as toxic but non-estrogenic test chemicals. The confounding impact of selected concentrations of these toxicants on the estrogenic activity of the hormone 17ss-estradiol was determined by co-incubation experiments. In a second step, the impact of toxic masking and synergistic modulation on the predictability of the joint action of 17ss-estradiol, estrone and estriol mixtures by concentration addition was analysed.
No geological exogenic force has altered the earth's surface during the last centuries in such an extent as human activity. Humans have altered the morphology and element balances of the earth by establishing agrosystems first and urban systems later. Currently, urban systems happen to become the main regulators for fluxes of many elements on a global scale due to ongoing industrial and economic development and a growing number of inhabitants. Additionally, urban systems are constantly expanding and cover more and more former natural and agricultural areas. For nature, urban systems are new phenomena, which never existed in previous geological eras. The process of the globe's urbanization concurrently is active with the global climate change. In fact, urban systems are a major emitter for climate active gases. Thus, beside the global changes in economy and society, urbanization is an important factor within the global change of nature as is already accepted for climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity.
Insertion of intravascular catheters is a commonly performed procedure in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. However, significant iatrogenic injuries to the peripheral vascular system can occur. Management ranges from anticoagulation and thrombolytics to surgical intervention. In this case, surgical therapy involved thrombectomy and microsurgical reconstruction of the femoral artery.
Simulations with a 3-dimensional computer model of the vibrating vocal folds.
Speech recordings of 51 patients (6 months after reconstructive surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for oral or oropharyngeal cancer) and of 18 control speakers were subjectively evaluated regarding intelligibility, nasal resonance, articulation, and patient-reported speech outcome (speech subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Head and Neck 35 module). Acoustic-phonetic analyses were performed to calculate formant values of the vowels /a, i, u/, vowel space, air pressure release of /k/ and spectral slope of /x/.
We set up an experimental model to evaluate the use of adoptively transferred cytotoxic CD1d-restricted T cells and alpha-GalCer in the treatment of mice engrafted with CD1d(+) lymphoid neoplastic cells. To this end the C1R cell line was transfected with CD1c or CD1d molecules. In addition, upon retroviral infection firefly luciferase was expressed on C1R transfected cell lines allowing the evaluation of tumor growth in xenografted immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice.
We retrospectively analyzed 452 adult acute leukemia patients diagnosed according to French-American-British (FAB) classification and biphenotypic acute leukemia diagnosed according to European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL) classification, respectively. Biological characteristics, response to treatment, and outcome were examined in biphenotypic acute leukemia patients and compared with that in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with complete follow-up profiles diagnosed in the same period.
Twenty-five patients were recruited presenting with myeloid malignancies and treated with a reduced intensity conditioning transplant regimen with graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprising in vivo lymphocyte depletion with alemtuzumab and cyclosporin. A prospective study was performed of lymphocyte subset reconstitution in peripheral blood in relation to the incidence of graft-versus-host disease.
In plasma samples from 21 patients with essential thrombocythemia and ten healthy subjects, the levels and the cellular origin of microparticles were determined by flowcytometric analysis, while the microparticle-associated procoagulant activity was measured using a thrombin generation assay.
Conventional or regulatory CD4(+) T cells were isolated with immunomagnetic microbeads based on the expression of CD4 and CD25. The effect of bortezomib on T-cell viability was analyzed by flow cytometry using 7-amino-actinomycin D staining. To investigate the possibility of obtaining an enriched regulatory T-cell population in vitro with the use of bortezomib, CD4(+) T cells were cultured during four weeks in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, IL-2 and bortezomib. The phenotype of these long-term cultured cells was studied, analyzing the expression of CD25, CD127 and FOXP3 by flow cytometry, and mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. Their suppressive capacity was assessed in co-culture experiments, analyzing proliferation and IFN-gamma and CD40L expression of stimulated responder T cells by flow cytometry.
Effects of flavopiridol were examined in ALK-positive and -negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells by means of immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses to assess cdk expression and activity, quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure drug-induced changes in transcription, and FACS analyses to monitor changes in proliferation and survival.
We determined the effects of phenoxodiol on plasma membrane electron transport, MTT responses and viability of activated and resting human T cells. In addition, we evaluated the effect of phenoxodiol on the viability of leukemic cell lines and primary myeloid and lymphoid leukemic blasts.
To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of this malignancy, we analyzed 27 cases of cytogenetically proven dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia.
An ex vivo granulocyte differentiation system was utilized to investigate the role of mammalian target of rapamycin in the regulation of myelopoiesis.
LS was measured by TE in all 165 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who underwent liver biopsy consecutively in Fujita Health University Hospital from July 2004 to September 2007.
Of the overall population, 25 142 individuals (8876 males, 16 266 females) participated in health examinations with HCV tests in 2005, and the most commonly associated markers for HCV-positive subjects were explored by multivariate analysis, based on blood biochemical, physical, sphygmomanometric and hematological parameters. Thereafter, the efficiencies of the markers were estimated from a total population of 85 013 individuals (29 502 males, 55 511 females) in 2003-2005.
In a case-control study, virological factors associated with the development of FHB were sought in 50 patients with FH developed by transient hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (FH-T) and 50 with acute self-limited hepatitis B (AHB) who were matched for sex and age. In addition, 12 patients with FH developed by acute exacerbation (AE) of asymptomatic HBV carrier (ASC) (FH-C) were also compared with 12 patients without FH by AE of chronic hepatitis B (AE-C).
We analyzed 297 patients from eight hospitals belonging to the HIV/AIDS Network of Japan.
In an open-label randomized controlled trial, 17 NASH patients with hyperlipidemia received colestimide (3 g/day) for 24 weeks. There were 21 control patients. All patients received lifestyle modification therapy. Efficacy was assessed based on metabolic profile, insulin resistance, transaminases, serum hepatic fibrosis markers, adipokine levels, visceral fat on computed tomography (CT), and the fatty liver grade on CT. NASH patients with moderate to severe steatosis by histology were also evaluated separately.
Three previously reported promoter polymorphisms, T-1993C, T-1514C and G-1499A, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Two common polymorphisms, T-1993C and T-1514C, were selected for genotyping in 1074 chronic HBV carriers, 310 spontaneously recovered controls and 374 HBV naive controls. Of 1074 HBV carriers, 234 were considered to be asymptomatic carriers and 840 were found to have chronic progressive liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Haplotypes were constructed for each subject and associations with the susceptibility to persistent HBV infection were estimated by logistic regression.
We retrospectively studied 181 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We defined ischemic hepatitis as having a value of serum aminotransferases equal to or higher than 1000 IU/L. We recorded the age, sex, comorbidity, site of infection, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission to the ICU, maximum SOFA score and inadequate antibiotic therapy.
Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis (without ongoing bacterial infections) and normal subjects. Cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with LPS. The abundance of 24 cytokines was measured using a filter-based, arrayed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the supernatant of cultured monocytes.
We used male KO mice and C57BL6/J (WT) mice fed methionine choline-deficient (MCD)-diet as a steatohepatitis model. Liver histology, hepatic oxidative stress markers, and hepatic gene expression levels were investigated. In addition, Hepa 1-6 cells, a mouse liver cell line, were cultured with or without recombinant adiponectin, and gene expressions were investigated by real-time RT-PCR.
Ultrasonographic examination and color flow imaging were performed using a color Doppler unit (Aplio 50 or XV, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) with a 3.5 MHz convex probe. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) for rectal varices in seven patients and partial splenic arterial embolization (PSE) for hypersplenism in four. We examined color flow images and measured the velocity of blood flow in rectal varices using fast-Fourier transform analysis by CDU in all eleven patients, before and after treatments.
We studied 37 prepubertal children with idiopathic short stature (ISS), comparing children with high-normal BMI (standard deviation scores, SDS 1.23 +/- 0.11, n = 20) and low-normal BMI (SDS -0.93 +/- 0.12, n = 17). The IGF-I response to GH was determined with an abbreviated IGF-I generation test, by measuring serum IGF-I concentrations at baseline and 24 h after the administration of GH (0.033 mg/kg).
201 short SGA children were investigated for four IGF1 gene polymorphisms in the promoter (-G1245A, -841(CA)(n)), intron 2 (+3703(CT)(n)) and 3UTR (+A1830G). Spontaneous growth and growth during GH treatment were studied.
We sequenced all exons including exon-intron boundaries and the promoter region of the HSD11B1 gene. Of 8 polymorphisms identified, we selected 4 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (g.-19835G&gt;A, g.-19609A&gt;G, g.+27447G&gt;C and g.+27810C&gt;T) based on location, linkage disequilibrium and frequency and which were genotyped in 757 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 644 nondiabetic subjects.
Forty-eight patients with type 1 DM and 26 healthy controls were investigated.
In this longitudinal study we describe the relationship between changes in fasting hormone levels, and forearm cross-sectional fat/muscle area in 54 short children with GHD and 37 short children born SGA during the first 12 months of GH treatment. Mean GH dose was 31.4 microg/kg/day for GHD and 53.2 microg/kg/day for SGA. HOMA2-IR was calculated as a steady-state fasting measure of insulin resistance.
We studied 20 prepubertal children (11 boys and 9 girls), born after a full-term pregnancy with a mean birth weight below 2.8 kg. They were studied at the mean age of 7.3 +/- 0.5 years (range 4-11 years). Their mean height was -1.8 +/- 0.3 SDS and their mean BMI was 0.1 +/- 0.2 SDS at the time of the study. The children were studied on 2 separate occasions, the first under basal conditions, and the second time after s.c. administration of 1 mg/kg of Iplex at 21.00 h. Blood samples for determination of leptin and insulin were obtained every 60 min between 23.00 h and 07.00 h, while the children were sleeping. In each patient, we calculated the leptin and insulin mean area under the curve, both under basal conditions and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex.
The F:M ratio of 133 children with CAT (group A, age at diagnosis 2.4-17.7 years) was compared with that of 113 adult CAT patients (group B, age at diagnosis 21-79 years). Group A included 64 prepubertal (aged 2.4-13.2 years, group A1) and 69 pubertal (aged 9.2-17.4, group A2) children.
Sixty-five GH deficient (GHD 1 and 2) and 86 control children were studied. Children in the GHD-1 subgroup (n=33) had low GH values (&lt;10 microg/L) after clonidine and levo-dopa while those in the GHD-2 subgroup (n=32) had normal GH values after pharmacologic provocation but low 24-hour GH secretory rates compared to 187 Normal Statured (NS) children. Of the 86 controls, who underwent IGF-I gen,50 were NS and 36 Short-Statured (SS). Serum IGF-I was measured prior to and daily during hGH administration (hGH 0.033 mg/kg/dayx4 days).
A total of 50 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (stage 5)on hemodialysis and 35 healthy individuals who served as controls (C) were evaluated. The 50 CKD patients were divided into two groups: the HD group consisted of 31 patients who received usual care without any physical activity during the hemodialysis sessions, while group HD/Exer included 19 patients who followed a program of physical exercise for six months. Plasma levels of PGE2, 6-Keto-PGF1alpha (the stable derivative of PGI2) and TXB2 (the stable derivative of TXA2) were measured by reliable enzymo-immunoassay methods (EIA) in HD and HD/Exer patients before and after the hemodialysis sessions as well as in the group of C.
This constitutes a prospective study carried out in a tertiary care private hospital and included 15 morbidly obese patients who underwent LSG. The operation was performed through two 12 mm and two 5 mm ports, using the Endo-GIA stapler to create a lesser curve gastric tube over a 36-Fr bougie.
Cross-sectional observational data on diabetes-related resource use were collected from 15,016 individuals with type 2 diabetes within the second wave of International Diabetes Management Practices Study. Mean (SD) annual quantities were determined and predictors of diabetes-related hospitalisations, inpatient days, emergency room visits and absenteeism were investigated using negative binomial regression.
Retrospective analysis based on claims data from the Integrated Healthcare Information Services (IHCIS) National Managed Care Benchmark Database.
OAD use and HbA(1c) testing were analysed for patients with &gt;or= 2 claims indicating diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and &gt;or= 1 90-day OAD treatment period between 1 January, 2000 and 30 June, 2006. Likelihood of HbA(1c) testing was examined using multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for OAD regimen and patients' sociodemographical characteristics.
This observational study included 356 patients with AF undergoing elective pharmacological or electrical cardioversion. Of these patients, 135 were not included based on exclusion criteria and the remaining 221 patients were divided into RAS group (n = 116, 69 male) or non-RAS group (n = 105, 58 male) based on precardioversion use of any RAS blocker.
Medical notes were retrospectively reviewed in patients undergoing brain MRI following referral for cognitive impairment to a memory clinic between January 2004 and June 2008. Patients with AD were graded into four categories of CVD severity based on neuroradiology reports and assessed for behavioural and NPS and activities of daily living using Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Bristol Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Frontal lobe symptoms and parkinsonian features were also evaluated.
The cost-effectiveness of atomoxetine for children with ADHD in the UK was compared with treatment alternatives using an economic model with Markov processes. The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment history and comorbidities precluding stimulants. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated and compared between treatment algorithms. The Markov process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across the treatments. Utility values were derived from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD, and treatment efficacy and safety were based on a review of controlled clinical trials and literature, and validated by international experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over 1-year.
This observational study enrolled 909 patients with MDD in psychiatric care settings in China, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. Patients were classified as PPS positive (PPS+) or negative (PPS-) based on mean modified Somatic Symptom Inventory scores of &gt;or= 2 or &lt; 2 respectively. The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)) determined depression severity; a visual analogue scale (VAS) determined pain severity; and the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) assessed well-being after 3 months observation.
Systematic review.
We searched PubMed (1950-2006), Scopus and Cochrane library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), examining the clinical effect of balneotherapy (both as a solitary approach and in the context of spa) on various diseases.
Data from peer-reviewed publications (1975-2007) of controlled, crossover design, pharmacodynamic studies on SAD medications in healthy volunteers were analysed. The number of objective psychometrics for each drug/dose level at all time points after dosing, and of instances of statistically significant impairment of cognitive function, enabled calculation of drug-induced cognitive impairment. The magnitude of impairment between drugs was compared using proportional impairment ratios (PIRs).
A comprehensive medical record review was conducted in 155 consecutive hospitalised patients (median age 79.0 years, interquartile range 66.0-86.0). Information was collected on: demographics; clinical characteristics (including medications and their doses); history of anticholinergic-induced adverse effects; and biochemical markers of hepatic and renal function (serum albumin concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR). The ARS was calculated for each patient using a standard scoring approach and Poisson regression was used for identifying variables associated with the ARS.
We have written this illustrated article to educate junior doctors without any practical experience in using tissue glue.
According to the diagnostic criteria of AOSD, we identified 84 patients between 1990 and 2003. The aim of this study was to analyse the characteristics of AOSD in Turkish patients who were followed-up in a tertiary referral centre.
The study population consisted of 265 patients with RA which were divided into two groups with respect to the presence or absence of consanguinity between their parents. The frequency of parental consanguinity was compared with the general population. The two groups were compared with respect to family history of RA, the age of onset, the age at which RA was diagnosed, duration of the disease, the presence of rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, serositis and the need for orthopaedic surgery, amyloidosis, the presence and level of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, erosive changes on radiographs, and the need for anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy.
The extract was obtained from fungal cultivation in Czapek-Dox medium. It was sterilized by filtration through a Millipore membrane, and injected (0.5 mg/mL) intradermally into the skin of rats, which were killed 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after inoculation. Skin specimens were placed in paraffin and stained using hematoxylin and eosin, and toluidine blue, for the evaluation of the inflammatory response, and Sirius red for the quantification of collagen. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) was used for the identification of apoptosis. Tissue reactions were graded and compared over time and compartment.
Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) (1995-2004), a cross-sectional analysis of ambulatory visits in the USA was performed. Outpatients presenting with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)-coded diagnoses of tinea unguium, tinea corporis/manuum, tinea pedis, tinea capitis, and tinea cruris were identified. Trends, descriptive epidemiology, and point prevalence estimates for these conditions were determined using stratification and standardization.
This study includes 40 lesions. Bcl-2 and CD10 immunohistochemistry were performed in all cases and the patterns of expression were analyzed.
Screening of the archives of the pathology departments of regional hospitals from 2002 to 2005 was performed. For each patient, clinical and pathologic data were collected. Cases of metastatic, multiple, or relapsing melanoma were excluded.
From December 1995 to December 2007, four patients with ID were followed in the dermatology outpatient clinic of the "Hospital das Cl√≠nicas" of the University of S√£o Paulo Medical School, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Epidemiologic data were collected and dermatologic examination was performed. Patients were submitted to histopathologic, hematologic, virologic, and immunologic investigations.
Two hundred and seven military personnel with cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania major, were treated with glucantime according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended protocol. All patients were nonindigenous to the area and had moved from a nonendemic area to a highly endemic area.
A 58-year-old man with bulky metastatic melanoma of the liver was treated with transcatheter arterial infusion of cisplatin and embolization therapy. The patient developed classic signs of TLS within 24 h of chemotherapy, including acute renal failure.
Cross-sectional associations between WBC and metabolic syndrome (MS) defined by revised NCEP criteria for Japanese, Japanese MS (JMS) defined by the Examination Committee for Criteria of Metabolic Syndrome, and diabetes were examined using medical check-up data from 1,880 men and 1,079 women.
Six patients with this syndrome were studied clinically and subjected to MRI neuroimaging; one underwent biopsy of the striatum, and another underwent additional MR spectroscopy at 3.0T and FDG-PET.
Ten female nude rats with MDA-MB 435 xenograft tumors were treated with 1 mg intraperitoneal bevacizumab when tumors reached 1 cm diameter and, for 4 rats, treated again 7 days later. Just before and 24 hours after the first injection of anti-VEGF antibody, the tumors were imaged by dynamic CT scans enhanced with PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo (n = 3 rats) or iohexol (n = 3 rats). The other 4 rats underwent dynamic CT scans enhanced with PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo just before and 24 hours after the second injection of anti-VEGF antibody. Microvascular leakiness (K(PS)) was calculated for the tumors using a 2-compartment tissue model.
We examined groups of 11 healthy preschool-aged children, 10 healthy adolescents, and 10 healthy adults with both, DTI and TMS/ipsilateral silent period (iSP). DTI-values for fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated for areas I to V of the CC. ISP-values for latency, duration, and extent of electromyography suppression were calculated.
Ewing sarcoma implanted orthotopically into the left thigh of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were evaluated with a 9.4 T MR unit by using a specific mouse whole body coil. Transverse T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, T1-weighted spin-echo sequences, and transverse echo-planar DWI examinations were performed at baseline, 24 hours and 72 hours after intraperitoneal injection of treosulfan in 2 different doses. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the viable parts of the tumor was automatically calculated from DWI imaging findings. These findings were correlated with histopathologic results at each time point. Volumetric measurements were performed by summing up the regions of interest in consecutive slices.
Thirty-one patients (22 men, 9 women; mean age 55.1 +/- 17.5 years) were selected based on global EFs calculated at the time of the clinical visit with the Argus postprocessing tool (Siemens Medical Solutions). Patients were then placed into 2 predetermined categories of normal: EF &gt;or=50% and abnormal: EF &lt;50%. Regional EF was calculated for each segment of a 16-segment cardiac model. Three blinded reviewers used the standard of care assessment of regional function, which was a qualitative grading of the 16 segments into categories of normal or abnormal regional wall motion by visual analysis. CIM quantitatively analyzed global EF and regional EF for each segment. These segments were then sorted into the predetermined categories of normal (EF &gt;or=50%) and abnormal (EF &lt;50%). Level of agreement was conducted via Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis for global EF analysis and observed proportion of agreement (p(a)), sensitivity, and specificity for regional EF analysis.
Fifty-one patients underwent dual-energy CT angiography of the lower-extremity arteries on a dual-source CT scanner. CT parameters were tube potentials, 140 and 80 kVp; exposure, 80 and 340 mAs/rot; and collimation, 14 x 1.2 mm. Bolus tracking was used in the descending aorta for timing (Ultravist 370). Bones were removed from the datasets using the 3 techniques and MIP datasets were generated. Two experienced radiologists assessed image quality ((1) correct removal of bones and preservation of vessels without artificial truncation, stenoses or occlusions of arteries; (2) minor errors with residual bone in the dataset or removal of side branches; (3) significant errors impeding diagnostic evaluation), number of vessel segmentation errors, and number of nonremoved bones. Additionally, time for MIP-generation was measured. The plaque removal tool was applied to DEBR MIPs and the outcome was rated as positive, neutral, or negative.
We reviewed all observational studies that evaluated the association between PD risk and tea consumption. Only, 12 studies were identified: 11 case-control and 1 cohort. These studies were carried out between 1981 and 2003. The studies represented different populations from 3 continents; North America, Europe and Asia. The 3 studies from Asia were case-control studies of Chinese populations.
Cross-sectional study investigating dietary intakes using food records. Parents were instructed to document all food and drink consumed by their child for 3 consecutive days.

Twenty-two subjects, with impaired fasting blood glucose with BMI ranging from 25 to 45, were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were given capsules containing either a placebo or 250 mg of an aqueous extract of cinnamon (Cinnulin PF) two times per day for 12 weeks. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were assessed using high performance liquid chromatography and plasma antioxidant status was evaluated using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Erythrocyte Cu-Zn superoxide (Cu-Zn SOD) activity was measured after hemoglobin precipitation by monitoring the auto-oxidation of pyrogallol and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity by established methods.
Participants were 5,081 French men and women aged 35-61 y, voluntarily enrolled in a long-term clinical trial of cancer and CVD prevention (SU.VI.MAX study). Participants provided 12 days of dietary recalls. Data on heights, weights, blood pressure, and lipid profiles were obtained from clinic visits.
Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores were calculated for each participant. The association between dietary and lifestyle variables and health was tested using analyses of variance and regression models in a cross sectional design.
Eleven healthy male volunteers were randomly given, at three separate times, SWF, MWF, and white-wheat bread (WWB, reference food). Plasma glucose, insulin and ghrelin concentrations were measured. The feeling of hunger was evaluated using a subjective rating scale. Starch structure of SWF and MWF was characterised by scanning electron microscopy.
Iron status was assessed using red cell distribution width, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). Tumor-necrosis factor-alpha provided a marker of inflammation, and body fat percentage (BF) was calculated from mean skinfold thickness measurements at 3 sites.
Sixteen male Syrian Golden hamsters (8-month-old; initial body weight 167 +/- 5 g) were divided into two groups and fed on atherogenic diets supplemented either with 0.5% linoleic acid or trans-10,cis-12 CLA, for 6 weeks. Liver lipids, fatty acid profile, protein, water and DNA contents were analysed. The activity and expression of several enzymes involved in liver fatty oxidation and lipogenesis were assessed, as was the expression of transcriptional factors controlling these enzymes.
Thirty cases of anembryonic pregnancy were diagnosed using ultrasound scanning that showed an empty gestation sac with no embryo pole in the uterus. Additionally, thirty women with normal pregnancy were followed through the delivery a live and normal baby. The cases and controls were matched by age and week of gestation. Levels of 55 elements, homocysteine, folate and S-adenosylhomocysteine in women with anembryonic pregnancies were compared with those of the women experiencing normal pregnancies.
The study was conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-treatment cross-over design trial. The participants visited the hospital as outpatients.
Twenty patients meeting the 1987 criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis completed the study.
The subjects were randomized in three groups to receive one of following supplementation; quercetin+vitamin C (166 mg+133 mg/capsule), alpha-lipoic acid (300 mg/capsule) or placebo for 4 weeks (3 capsules/day). Each treatment period consisted of 4 weeks with 2 weeks of wash-out period before the subject starts next supplementation.
Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta), interleukin -6(IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. The severity of disease was evaluated using Korean Health Assessment Questionnaire(KHAQ) and Visual Analogue Scale(VAS). Nutrient intake was measured at baseline and at the end of each intervention period.
In this cross-sectional study, food and fluid intake and physical activity in 116 healthy overweight adults (BMI: 25-36 kg/m(2); age: 18-60y) was compared between a non-intervention and an intervention week using diet diaries and pedometers. The major outcomes were steps/day, daily caloric intake, macronutrient intake and meal size. Within subject ANOVAs were conducted to compare results between intervention and non-intervention weeks.
Secondary analysis of data from the 1999-2004 NHANES. SUBJECTS/ SETTING: Participants 2 years of age and older.
Percentage of the population meeting current recommendations for calcium, potassium and magnesium.
Percentage of EAR/AI for nutrients was calculated based on age/gender specific values. All analyses were weighted using the NHANES six-year sample weights and adjusted for the complex sample design of NHANES with the statistical package SUDAAN.
One reviewer independently conducted systematic searches in eight databases. The authors then abstracted information, assessed study quality and combined odds ratios (ORs), when obtainable, by using a random-effects model.
The authors used data from a National Institute of Dental Research survey of the oral health of U.S. children conducted in 1986 and 1987 to determine the prevalence of caries and mean decayed, missing or filled surfaces on permanent maxillary right first molars in children 7 to 17 years of age who had a history of a single residence. (To date, this is the only national oral health data set in the United States with detailed information on fluoride exposures.) They examined the association between enamel fluorosis and caries using logistic regression analysis, controlling for potential confounders in communities with water at or above optimal fluoridation levels and in communities with nonfluoridated or suboptimally fluoridated water.
The authors conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify original research articles and case reports that described oral conditions and associated factors that result in sequestrum formation and bone exposure.
Thirty participants, each of whom had at least two pairs of similar-sized noncarious cervical lesions, took part in this study. The authors placed 120 restorations, 30 in each of four groups: Clearfil S3 Bond (Kuraray, Osaka, Japan) (CS) and iBond Gluma inside (Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) (IB), and Clearfil S3 Bond (CSB) and iBond Gluma inside (IBB) with an extra layer of hydrophobic adhesive applied on top of them. They placed the restorations incrementally, using a resin-based composite. The authors evaluated the restorations at baseline and at 18 months following modified U.S. Public Health Service criteria.
The authors analyzed Medicaid dental claims data for 50,485 children residing in Wayne County, Mich. The study sample included children aged 5 through 12 years in 2002 who had been enrolled in Medicaid for at least one month and had had at least one dental visit each year from 2002 through 2005. The authors assessed dental care utilization and treatment patterns cross-sectionally for each year and longitudinally.
The authors enrolled 144 participants (67 natural red-haired and 77 dark-haired) aged 18 to 41 years in a cross-sectional observational study. Participants completed validated survey instruments designed to measure general and dental care-specific anxiety, fear of dental pain and previous dental care avoidance. The authors genotyped participants' blood samples to detect variants associated with natural red hair color.
The authors measured the pH and titratable acidity of candies dissolved in artificial saliva or water. They then measured the lesion depths of enamel surfaces exposed to candy slurries for 25 hours. Statistical analyses included two-sample t tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to identify differences between original-flavor and sour candies, as well as correlations to identify relationships between lesion depths, pH and titratable acidity.
A randomized controlled repeated-measure design was used, and generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate status at baseline and 4 and 12 months after initiation of the Res-Care intervention.
Twelve nursing homes in Maryland.

Adults aged 65 and older (n=323).
Data on self-reported asthma, depression, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were collected through interviewer-administered surveys (in English and Spanish) and chart abstraction. Chart-based disease was defined in two ways: physician documentation and physician documentation plus use of a medication to treat that condition. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement were calculated. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were used to determine the associations between patient characteristics and patient-chart agreement.
Systematic review and metasynthesis of primary research reporting the impact of PU and PU interventions on HRQL according to direct patient reports. Quality assessment criteria were developed and applied. Data extraction identified findings in the form of direct quotes from patients or questionnaire items and domain results. Combined synthesis of qualitative and quantitative research was performed using content analysis to generate categories and themes from findings. Thirteen electronic databases were searched, and hand searching, cross-referencing, contact with experts, and an online search was undertaken. No language restrictions were applied.

Prospective study.
Two nursing homes.
Fifty-two nursing home residents.
Thirty residents with impaired oral hygiene were randomly assigned to manual oral brushing plus 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinse at different frequencies daily. Twenty-two residents with swallowing difficulty were randomly assigned to upright feeding positioning, teaching swallowing techniques, or manual oral brushing. All protocols were administered over 3 months.
Feasibility was assessed monthly and defined as high if the protocol took less than 10 minutes to administer. Adherence was assessed weekly and defined as high if full staff adherence was demonstrated in more than 75% of assessments. Effectiveness for improved oral hygiene (reduction in oral plaque score) and swallowing (reduction in cough during swallowing) was compared at baseline and 3 months.
Cluster-randomized trial.
Fifteen psychogeriatric nursing home wards in the Netherlands.
In total, 432 psychogeriatric nursing home residents from 15 psychogeriatric nursing home wards in seven nursing homes were selected for participation; 404 consented, and 371 of these were available at baseline. Two hundred forty-one from 14 wards had complete data and were included in the data analyses.
The nursing home wards were assigned at random to educational intervention or control status. The educational intervention consisted of an educational program for nursing staff combined with consultation with a nurse specialist (registered nurse (RN) level).
Data were collected at baseline and 1, 4, and 8 months postintervention. At each measurement, the use of physical restraints was measured using observations of blinded, trained observers on four separate occasions over a 24-hour period. Other resident characteristics, such as cognitive status, were determined using the Minimum Data Set.
We performed a randomized, participant and outcome assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Participants, stratified by operative procedure (either arthroscopic decompression or rotator cuff repair), were given preemptive 1% ropivacaine (20 mL) and intraoperative intravenous parecoxib (40 mg) and were randomly assigned to 0.75% ropivacaine or placebo by elastomeric pump at 5 mL/hr. Pain at rest was reported on a verbal analogue scale at fifteen, thirty, and sixty minutes and at two, four, eight, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four hours. The use of alternative analgesia, delay in discharge, and adverse events, including development of stiff painful shoulder, infection, and leakage, were also assessed.
Forty-six patients with an injury to a single limb were randomized to be treated with augmented external fixation (twenty-two patients), a locked volar plate (twelve), or a locked radial column plate (twelve). The fracture classifications included Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) types A3, C1, C2, and C3. The patients completed the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire at the time of follow-up. Grip and lateral pinch strength, the ranges of motion of the wrist and forearm, and radiographic parameters were also evaluated.
Seventy subjects undergoing total knee replacement were randomized to receive either the Trabecular Metal or the cemented tibial component. Radiostereometric analysis of micromotion of the tibial components was performed postoperatively at six, twelve, and twenty-four months, and the maximum total point motion of the implant and three-dimensional translations and rotations were recorded.
Patients who were fifty years old or more, with no history of infection, and were undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty were randomized at the time of surgery to receive either an all-polyethylene or a metal-backed tibial component. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at one, three, five, eight, and ten years postoperatively. All assessments included a clinical history, a physical examination, and a radiographic evaluation. A total of 510 consecutive patients (566 knees) were recruited from August 1993 to January 1997. The mean age of the patients at the time of the index arthroplasty was 69.3 years, and 299 (59%) were women. The primary diagnosis was osteoarthritis for 458 knees (80.9%) and rheumatoid arthritis for 108 knees (19.1%).
Forty-seven patients with symptomatic type-II SLAP tears were evaluated preoperatively and at least two years postoperatively with use of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and L'Insalata outcomes instruments and physical examination. The study group included thirty-nine male and eight female patients with a mean age of thirty-six years; thirty-four of the forty-seven patients were athletes. Patients with rotator cuff tears requiring repair or concomitant shoulder instability were excluded.
We performed a prospective, randomized, multicenter pilot study to investigate the use of rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge combined with a ceramic-granule bulking agent as a replacement for autogenous iliac crest bone graft in single-level posterolateral lumbar arthrodesis with instrumentation. The investigational group (twenty-five patients) was treated with a 1.5 mg/mL solution of rhBMP-2 on two strips of absorbable collagen sponge (total dose of rhBMP-2, 12 mg) combined with 10 cm(3) of ceramic granules. The control group (twenty-one patients) received iliac crest bone graft. Clinical outcomes were assessed with use of well-established instruments. Radiographs were reviewed to assess consolidation of fusion.
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to analyze bearing type and demographic characteristics associated with 112,095 primary total hip arthroplasties performed in the United States between October 1, 2005, and December 31, 2006. The prevalence of each type of total hip arthroplasty bearing was calculated for population subgroups as a function of age, sex, census region, payer class, and hospital type.
From 1988 to 2005, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample recorded over 1 million patients who underwent joint replacement surgery. The present retrospective study compared patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (n = 3973), those with controlled diabetes mellitus (n = 105,485), and those without diabetes mellitus (n = 920,555) with regard to common surgical and systemic complications, mortality, and hospital course alterations. Additional stratification compared the effects of glucose control among patients with Type-I and Type-II diabetes. Glycemic control was determined by physician assessments on the basis of the American Diabetes Association guidelines with use of a combination of patient self-monitoring of blood-glucose levels, the hemoglobin A1c level, and related comorbidities.
We conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive series of male patients who had a saddle-horn injury of the pelvis after being bucked from a horse. Clinical and radiographic results were assessed more than eighteen months after the injury. Functional outcome measures were evaluated at the time of the latest follow-up with use of visual analog pain scales, a questionnaire addressing occupational and recreational function, the International Index of Erectile Function instrument, the Iowa pelvic score, and the Short Form-36.
Dorsoplantar weight-bearing radiographs of sixty normal feet (the control group) and sixty-five feet with hallux valgus (the hallux valgus group) in a study of adult women were reviewed. The feet in the hallux valgus group were treated with a proximal metatarsal osteotomy, and the radiographs were assessed preoperatively, at the early follow-up interval (at a mean of 3.1 months), and at the most recent follow-up interval (at a mean of forty-five months). The position of the medial sesamoid was classified with a grading system ranging from I through VII as described by Hardy and Clapham. In the feet with hallux valgus, we defined a grade of IV or less as the normal position of the medial sesamoid (the normal-position group) and grade V or greater as lateral displacement of the sesamoid (the displacement group).
Twelve patients who underwent allograft-prosthetic composite reconstruction of the proximal part of the tibia after tumor resection were retrospectively evaluated at a median follow-up of forty-nine months. Clinical records and radiographs were reviewed to evaluate patient outcome, healing at the allograft-host junction, function, construct survival, and complications.
Data were collected prospectively during a multicenter study. Surgical procedures were divided into three categories: primary device implantation, device exchange, and device lengthening. Further retrospective evaluation was undertaken in cases of neurologic injury or changes detected with neuromonitoring.
Between June 1981 and December 1983, 196 consecutive total hip arthroplasties were performed with use of an Iowa stem and a titanium-backed cemented acetabular component, with cobalt-chromium cable trochanteric reattachment. After nineteen to twenty years of follow-up, the patients were evaluated with regard to the depth of head penetration into the polyethylene (as a surrogate for wear), osteolysis, loosening, and the need for revision. The results were compared with those for a series of 304 total hip arthroplasties that were performed by the same surgeon from January 1984 to December 1985 with use of the same components and the same surgical technique, but with stainless steel wire trochanteric reattachment. The two groups had a comparable nineteen to twenty-year follow-up. All living patients (fifty-nine hips in the cable group and ninety-two hips in the wire group) had minimum ten-year follow-up radiographs.
One hundred and eleven tibial lengthening procedures in sixty-three patients were chosen. Seventy-six segments underwent lengthening with an Ilizarov ring fixator, and thirty-five segments had lengthening over an intramedullary nail. Serial radiographs were evaluated with regard to the amounts of tibiofibular distraction difference, proximal tibiofibular joint distraction, distal tibiofibular joint distraction, tibial axial deviation, and heel malalignment. Clinically, laxity at the knee was evaluated and fibular head instability was assessed. Variations in all of these parameters were evaluated with respect to tibiofibular joint fixation, etiology, skeletal maturity, lengthening over an intramedullary nail, and amount of lengthening.
Two hundred patients who had transplantation of an autologous osteochondral graft obtained from an asymptomatic knee for the treatment of an osteochondral defect of the talus were evaluated. Of the 200 patients, 112 were followed for a minimum of two years (mean duration of follow-up, fifty-five months). The WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and the Lysholm score were used to assess functional outcome. Variables that were examined included the number of grafts, total size of the harvested cylinders, patient age, body mass index, and overall satisfaction of the patient with the result of the procedure at the knee. A multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to determine the influence of each parameter on the WOMAC and Lysholm scores. In addition, the Lysholm scores for the entire patient group were reviewed to determine how long after the index surgery clinical improvement ceased.
The records of 122 consecutive patients who were fifty-five years of age or older and in whom a Neer three or four-part proximal humeral fracture had been treated surgically between January 2002 and November 2005 were studied retrospectively. After exclusions, thirty-eight patients treated with a locked-plate construct were compared with forty-eight patients who had undergone hemiarthroplasty. All patients had radiographic and clinical follow-up at a minimum of twenty-four months and an average of thirty-six months. Reduction and implant placement were evaluated radiographically. Clinical outcomes were measured with use of the Constant-Murley system.
We reviewed thirty patients with congenital scoliosis (including fifteen patients with failure of vertebral formation and fifteen with failure of vertebral segmentation). All patients had adequate axial T2-weighted, digitally formatted magnetic resonance imaging scans that were suitable for cross-sectional measurement. Cross-sectional areas of the spinal cord and spinal canal at each of the twelve thoracic levels were calculated three times by a blinded observer, and the average values were compared with measurements from age-matched normal controls.
Developmental dysplasia of the hip, avascular necrosis, and the treatment algorithm were carefully defined. The outcome was determined as the probability of any neonate having a non-arthritic hip through the age of sixty years. A decision tree was then built with decision nodes as described above, and chance node probabilities were determined from a thorough review of the literature. Foldback analysis and sensitivity analyses were performed.
The asymmetrical deficit was calculated ([fractured limb/sum of both lower limbs] x 100%) for isometric knee extension torque, rate of force development during isometric testing, and leg extension power. The asymmetrical measures for lower-limb muscle mass (fractured limb--nonfractured limb), and that of lower-limb pain and disease and injury burden (nonfractured limb--fractured limb), were calculated.
Fifty-four patients with unilateral obstetric brachial plexopathy who were ten to sixty days old underwent bilateral motor-nerve-conduction studies of the axillary, musculocutaneous, proximal radial, distal radial, median, and ulnar nerves. The ratio between the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential of the affected limb and that of the healthy side was called the axonal viability index. The patients were followed and classified in three groups according to the clinical outcome. We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curve of each index to define the best cutoff point to detect patients with a poor recovery.
Radial head implants of varying thicknesses were inserted into seven cadaver specimens, which were then assessed clinically and radiographically. Eight stages were examined: the intact specimen (stage 1); repair of the lateral collateral ligament (stage 2); radial head resection with repair of the lateral collateral ligament (stage 3); insertion of an implant of the correct thickness (stage 4); and insertion of an implant that resulted in radial overlengthening of 2 mm (stage 5), 4 mm (stage 6), 6 mm (stage 7), or 8 mm (stage 8). The specimens were tested with and without muscle loading to simulate resting muscle tone and surgical paralysis, respectively. At each stage, radiographs were made to measure the ulnohumeral joint space and the lateral ulnohumeral joint was visually assessed.
With survey data from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and using standard financial techniques, we calculated the estimated return on investment of an additional year of orthopaedic training over a working lifetime. The net present value, internal rate of return, and the break-even point were estimated. Eight fellowships were examined and compared with general orthopaedic practice.
The UNITE survey was an Internet-based initiative that recruited patients and caregivers from 11 countries (Australia, Brazil, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom). Opinion Research Corporation, Princeton, NJ, conducted the UNITE survey between June 10, 2006, and September 11, 2006, and analyzed the results.

We evaluated the incidence of STI among men aged 18-24 years enrolled in a randomized trial of circumcision to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Kisumu, Kenya. The outcome was first incident nonulcerative STI during 2 years of follow-up. STIs examined were laboratory-detected Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis infection.
The neonatal rotavirus candidate vaccine 116E was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation trial in India. Two doses of the Vero cell-adapted vaccine were evaluated. One hundred eighty-seven infants received a vaccine dose of 1 X 10(4) focus-forming units (ffu) and 182 received a dose of 1 X 10(5) ffu in a 1:1 randomization with placebo recipients. Infants received the vaccine at 8, 12, and 16 weeks, separately from routine vaccines.
var messenger RNA was isolated from 78 children with asymptomatic, mild, or severe malaria. We prepared complementary DNA from the upstream region into the DBL1alpha domain and picked, on average, 20 clones for sequencing.
C. albicans strain SC-5314 was grown in standard growth medium in the presence or absence a commercially available LE. Biofilms grown on silicone-elastomer catheter discs in these media were compared for mass by dry weight measurements. Biofilm morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser microscopy. The effect of LE on C. albicans germination and growth was evaluated microscopically and by determination of colony-forming units, respectively.
With the recent finding that activated CD4(+) T cells express TLR2 as a costimulatory receptor, we hypothesized that M. tuberculosis and its components may directly affect CD4(+) T cells by engaging TLR2, thus facilitating the expansion and function of these lymphocytes in tuberculous pleura.
We examined the predictive value of 4 algorithms at predicting virologic response (VR) during 734 treatment-change episodes (TCEs). VR was defined as attaining plasma HIV-1 RNA levels below the limit of quantification. Drug-specific genotypic susceptibility scores (GSSs) were calculated by applying each algorithm to the baseline genotype. Weighted GSSs were calculated by multiplying drug-specific GSSs by antiretroviral (ARV) potency factors. Regimen-specific GSSs (rGSSs) were calculated by adding unweighted or weighted drug-specific GSSs for each salvage therapy ARV. The predictive value of rGSSs were estimated by use of multivariate logistic regression.
Six different 14-day dosages of oral ciprofloxacin were randomly assigned to 48 healthy volunteers. Individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters combining antibiotic exposure in plasma, saliva, and stool specimens and ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and mutant prevention concentrations against viridans group streptococci in the pharyngeal flora and Escherichia coli in the fecal flora were estimated. Their links with the emergence of resistance to nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin in the fecal flora and to levofloxacin in the pharyngeal flora 7, 14, or 42 days after ciprofloxacin initiation were investigated.
We conducted a randomized, controlled, phase 2b trial of RTS,S/AS02A in 2022 Mozambican children aged 1-4 years. We now report safety results for all randomized subjects and vaccine efficacy (VE) findings for children in the Manhi√ßa area over the 45-month surveillance period.
In a double-blind, randomized trial, 102 healthy volunteers were evenly allocated to receive RTS,S/AS01B or RTS,S/AS02A vaccine at months 0, 1, and 2 of the study, followed by malaria challenge. Protected vaccine recipients were rechallenged 5 months later.
We conducted survival analyses of 310 consecutive subjects (including 80 patients &gt; or = 75 years of age) who developed cardiogenic shock after AMI at two study centers - Rush University Medical Center and the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County (both in Chicago, Illinois). The data were collected over a 6-year period. Where appropriate, we used Kaplan-Meier survival plots, multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, stepwise multivariate Poisson regression analyses and unconditional logistic regression analysis.
Blood samples were obtained from ovine subjects to characterize the optical response of blood by measuring the reflectance spectrum at varying levels of hematocrit diluted by a contrast agent. The results from the in-vitro test were implemented into an in-vivo system. An aspiration catheter equipped with a fiberoptic sensor was inserted into the coronary sinus (CS) of 5 canines. Contrast was administered through the coronary artery and reflectance signals were recorded at the CS. The removal rate was analyzed through 20 specimen collections.
All patients (n = 52) who underwent LMTCAD at our center in 2006-2007 and treated with the PES form the basis of this report. Demographic, clinical, procedural and in-hospital outcome variables were reviewed. Angiograms were analyzed by an operator blinded to the patients' history. Mid-term follow up was achieved from medical records and/or phone calls. The primary endpoint of the study was either cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or target lesion revascularization (TLR) on follow up. Follow up was achieved in 47/51 patients (92.2%) at a mean of 292.8 +/- 104.6 days. Patients were classified as Type A (30.8%) disease involving the LM and origin of branches, or Type B (69.2%) disease involving the origin of the trifurcation branches only, but not the LM artery. All patients were treated with kissing balloon after stenting. Descriptive analysis was performed on all variables with mean +/- standard deviation for continuous variables and percentages describing dichotomous variables. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictors of the primary endpoint.
E-mail invitations were sent to the 96 members of the Congenital Cardiovascular Interventional Study Consortium (CCISC). The survey was Internet-based and mainly consisted of multiple-choice questions.
From a total of 2,330 consecutive patients treated at our institution with DES, we selected 207 elderly patients (&gt; or = 75 years of age) who underwent, from May 2002 to December 2006, sirolimus-eluting stent (SES group, 116 patients [pts], 56%) or paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES group, 91 pts, 43.9%) implantation. We evaluated the 24-month incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).

The analysis of data was done with both SPSS 14.0 for descriptive statistics and AMOS 5.0 for covariance structure analysis.
We performed extensive mutation analyses of all 51 coding exons of the LRRK2 gene in index cases from 226 Parkinson's disease families compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance, mostly from France (n = 182) and North Africa (n = 14).
61 index cases with NF1 clinical diagnosis but no identifiable NF1 mutation were screened for SPRED1 mutation.
We implemented analyses in 3484 men and women aged 18 years or older, at three study centres.
We analysed anti-IA-2 and anti-GAD 65 autoantibody data from 2282 T1D patients from 1117 multiplex families. HLA genotyping was available for all cases and their parents and association with autoantibody positivity was tested by the transmission disequilibrium test.
85 patients with a mild NF1 phenotype were screened for SPRED1 mutations. 44 patients negative for both NF1 and SPRED1 mutations were then screened for SPRED2-3 and SPRY1-4 mutations. Complexity analysis was applied to analyse the flanking sequences surrounding the identified SPRED1 mutations for the presence of direct and inverted repeats or symmetric sequence elements in order to infer probable mutational mechanism.
To identify new transcriptional pathways altered by the normal and/or abnormal function of huntingtin, we probed several nuclear receptors, normally expressed in the brain, for binding to huntingtin in its mutant and wild-type forms.
This retrospective cohort study examines mortality outcomes among patients included in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2004. Patients included in the cohort were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for SAH. Multivariable logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses are used to measure the association of weekend admission on mortality for patients with SAH, adjusted for differences in patient characteristics that also contribute to mortality risk.
This novel sensor system consists of a hemostatic valve connected to the proximal end of a microcatheter (Y-connector). The sensor principle is based on an optical system composed of a light-emitting diode (LED) and a line sensor. The latter measures how much the coil-delivery wire slightly bends in response to the insertion pressure by detecting the wire shadow. This information is translated into a given force level. Experimental aneurysm embolization was performed using this optical sensor. A silicone aneurysm model and an in vivo model (porcine aneurysm model) were used in this study. Several surgeons manually performed the coil insertions. The sensor continuously monitored the mechanical force during the insertions.
Three patient-specific silicone aneurysm models based on clinical images were used in this study. Model 1 was constructed from a wide-necked internal carotid artery-ophthalmic artery aneurysm, and Models 2 and 3 were constructed from small wide-necked middle cerebral artery aneurysms. Neuroform stents were placed in the in vitro aneurysm models, and flow structures were compared before and after the stent placements. Flow velocity fields were acquired with particle imaging velocimetry.
The signal intensity of the MCA ipsilateral to CEA on preoperative MR angiography was graded according to the ability to visualize the MCA in 106 patients with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (&gt;or=70%). Diffusion weighted MR imaging was performed within 3 days of and 24 hours after surgery. The presence or absence of new postoperative neurological deficits was also evaluated.
The EPO and IGF-I were administered intranasally to mice that underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Stroke volumes were measured after 1 hour of MCAO and 24 hours of reperfusion. To evaluate the long-term effects of this treatment, behavioral outcomes were assessed at 3, 30, 60, and 90 days following MCAO. Radiography and liquid scintillation were used to visualize and quantify the uptake of radiolabeled 125I-EPO and 125I-IGF-I into the mouse brain after intranasal, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration.
A MEDLINE (1950-2007) database search was performed using the following keywords, singly and in combination: "ventriculoperitoneal shunt," "hydrocephalus," "subarachnoid hemorrhage," "aneurysm," "fenestration," and "lamina terminalis." Additional studies were manually singled out by scrutinizing references from identified manuscripts, major neurosurgical journals and texts, and personal files. A recent study from the authors' institution was also incorporated into the review. Data from included studies were analyzed using the chi-square analysis and Student t-test. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare overall incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus.
Cerebral metabolism was prospectively studied in 182 patients with aSAH. The database was retrospectively analyzed with respect to ICP. Patients were classified into 2 groups based on ICP. There were 164 with low ICP (&lt;20 mm Hg) and 18 with high ICP (&gt;or=20 mm Hg, measured&gt;6 hours/day). Cerebral microdialysis parameters of energy metabolism, glycerol, and glutamate levels were analyzed hourly from the brain parenchyma of interest for 7 days. The 12-month outcome in these patients was evaluated.
Sixteen patients with internal carotid artery stenosis (&gt;70%) underwent PET scanning before CAS, 1-7 days after CAS, and 3-4 months after CAS to assess a variety of parameters related to cerebral perfusion and metabolism.
Two hundred and forty-three adult patients were enrolled in this 1-year retrospective study. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between baseline clinical factors and the presence or absence of seizure during the study period.
Eight patients with intracerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and aneurysms underwent surgical treatment of their lesions in a combined endovascular surgical suite. After initial head positioning, preoperative biplane and rotational angiography was performed. Resection of the AVM or clipping of the aneurysm was then performed. Further biplane and rotational 3D angiograms were obtained intraoperatively to confirm satisfactory treatment.
Selections from fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were stained for histological examination with H &amp; E and Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Lipid dye Oil Red O was used to stain vessel specimens that were embolized using NBCA. Specimens were evaluated for the presence of embolic agent, inflammation, angionecrosis, and evidence of recanalization. These results were correlated with the time interval between the bleeding, embolization, and resection.
Eleven patients-6 men and 5 women with a mean age of 48 years and each with a ruptured VBA-DA not amenable to internal trapping of the parent artery-underwent an SAC-SWS between November 2005 and October 2007. The feasibility and clinical and angiographic outcomes of this combined procedure were retrospectively evaluated.
Nine experimental aneurysms were created. The aneurysm dome was first embolized with bare platinum coils and HydroCoils, and then the remaining neck portion was embolized with HydroSoft coils to obtain maximum aneurysm occlusion. Follow-up angiography was performed at 1 and 3 months, and histopathological analysis was performed after the 3-month follow-up angiography.
Data obtained in 3567 patients who were entered into randomized trials of tirilazad between 1991 and 1997 were analyzed. Patients underwent treatment in 162 neurosurgical centers in 21 countries in North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. The dependent variable was clinical outcome assessed 3 months after SAH with the Glasgow Outcome Scale, which was analyzed as a 5-point variable and dichotomized into favorable (good recovery or moderate disability) and unfavorable (severe disability, vegetative state, or death) outcomes. The effect of country or continent of treatment on outcome was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and proportional odds modeling before and after adjusting for numerous other factors significantly associated with outcome.
The authors investigated the tractography appearance of the descending motor pathways in 6 patients with intracranial vascular malformations. Of these patients 4 presented with a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, 2 of whom were clinically hemiparetic. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using a 1.5-T clinical MR imaging system, and whole-brain tractography was performed after reconstruction of the data. A fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.05 was used to terminate the tractography. The semiautomatic motor pathway segmentation technique required definition of a single voxel within the corticospinal tract of the medulla from which the descending motor pathways were automatically defined by grouping together all streamlines within the entire image with a geometry similar to that of the single streamline generated from this initial voxel. The results of this segmentation were then visually assessed and compared with the patient's motor function.
In a prospective study design, patients with symptomatic carotid artery (CA) occlusion were selected for C-Port-assisted high-flow EC-IC bypass surgery if they met the following criteria: 1) transient or moderate permanent symptoms of focal ischemia; 2) CA occlusion; 3) hemodynamic instability; and 4) had provided informed consent. Bypasses were done using a radial artery graft that was proximally anastomosed to the superficial temporal artery trunk, the cervical external, or common CA. All distal cerebral anastomoses were performed on M2 branches using the C-Port Flex-A system.
Within 72 hours of aSAH, 80 patients (age range 24-82 years) were randomized to receive intravenous EPO (30,000 U) or placebo every 48 hours for a total of 90,000 U. Primary end points were the incidence, duration, and severity of vasospasm and impaired autoregulation on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Secondary end points were incidence of DIDs and outcome at discharge and at 6 months.
To understand its neuroprotective effect in vitro, GM-CSF was administered to a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity neuronal injury cell culture model that mimics the pathophysiology of focal hypoxic cerebral injury. In the animal study, the authors prepared a rat focal cerebral ischemia model by occluding the unilateral middle cerebral artery. They then examined the effects of GM-CSF administration on changes in infarct volume, apoptosis-related gene expression, and improvement in locomotor behavior.
The medical charts of 2808 children hospitalized between 1988 and 2007 for a true craniosynostosis were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided according to their subtype of craniosynostosis (sagittal, plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, metopic, oxycephaly, syndromic cases, or unclassifiable).
Eighty-four patients who underwent spinal cord untethering after at least 1 primary repair were retrospectively evaluated using scaled and subjective outcome measures at short-term and long-term follow-up visits. Outcomes were analyzed for predictive measures using multivariate logistic regression.
The authors conducted a prospective, controlled, clinical trial of data obtained in a pediatric intensive care unit of a regional trauma center. All patients were sedated and mechanically ventilated prior to inclusion in the study. Children with sustained, elevated ICP (&gt; 18 mm Hg) resistant to first-tier therapies received a single ketamine dose (1-1.5 mg/kg) either to prevent further ICP increase during a potentially distressing intervention (Group 1) or as an additional measure to lower ICP (Group 2). Hemodynamic, ICP, and CPP values were recorded before ketamine administration, and repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare these values with those recorded every minute for 10 minutes following ketamine administration.
The 4 centers of the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network participated in a retrospective chart review of infants with PHH who underwent treatment at each institution between 2001 and 2006. Patients were included if they had received a diagnosis of Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, weighed &lt; 1500 g at birth, and had received surgical intervention. The authors determined the incidence of conversion from a temporizing device to a permanent shunt, the incidence of CSF infection during temporization, and the 6-month CSF infection rate after permanent shunt placement.
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging was performed in 24 infants with progressive hydrocephalus before and after CSF diversion. Parametric images of the trace apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were obtained. The ADCs of 5 different cortical and subcortical regions of interest were calculated pre- and postoperatively in each patient. The ADC values were compared with age-related normal values. Mean arterial blood pressure and anterior fontanel pressure were measured immediately after each MR imaging study.
The expression of stathmin protein was examined by immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections obtained in 17 consecutive patients with medulloblastoma who underwent resection between 1995 and 2005. Four patients were excluded because they were either lost to follow-up or underwent biopsy sampling only, leaving a total of 13 patients in the study. The stathmin expression was scored according to the immunoreactive fraction of tumor cells, and the level was correlated with various clinicopathological factors.
The authors retrospectively reviewed the MR imaging findings in 60 consecutive patients who were reported to have pineal cysts over a 19-month period. Patients were identified retrospectively using a word search of radiology reports. Of these 60 patients, 24 with stable follow-up imaging or pathological proof of a pineal cyst were included in this study. In all cases, axial or sagittal FLAIR images were available, and in 10 of 24 patients the authors obtained sagittal images using fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA). For those cases in which FIESTA studies were obtained, the authors classified the cysts into 1 of 4 categories based on their appearance. Eighteen of 24 cases were performed with intravenous contrast.
This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the methods of treatment used to manage IIS at a single institution. The authors reviewed 31 consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of IIS. Patients were screened to ensure that there were no confounding congenital anomalies or comorbidities that may have contributed to the spinal deformity. The average age at the time of initial treatment was 25 months. Treatment modalities included bracing, serial body casting, and VEPTR. Pretreatment, posttreatment, and most recent Cobb angles were compared to assess the overall curve correction, and patient charts were reviewed for the occurrence of complications.
Between January 2006 and March 2008, 8 patients who presented with vertical mobile and reducible atlantoaxial dislocations were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India. The vertical atlantoaxial dislocation/basilar invagination reduced completely on extension of the neck, with no need of any cervical traction. According to the extent of superior migration of the odontoid process, and measurements based on the vertical atlantoaxial instability index, the dislocation was graded as mild, moderate, or severe. All patients were treated using the C-1 lateral mass and C-2 pars plate and screw method of fixation.
Prospective follow-up was performed in 55 consecutive patients who underwent instrumented fusion of C-2 by a single surgeon. The causes of spinal instability and type and extent of instrumentation were documented. All patients underwent preoperative CT or MR imaging scans to determine the suitability of C-2 screw placement. Intraoperatively, screws were placed following dissection of the posterior pars interarticularis. Postoperative CT scans were performed to determine the extent of cortical breach. Patients underwent clinical follow-up, and complications were recorded as vascular or neurological. A CT-based grading system was created to characterize such breaches objectively by location and magnitude via percentage of screw diameter beyond the cortical edge (0 = none; I = &lt; 25% of screw diameter; II = 26-50%; III = 51-75%; IV = 76-100%).
Nine fresh-frozen C-7 cadaveric specimens were scanned for bone mineral density using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Prior to testing, all specimens were imaged using CT to obtain 1-mm axial sections. Caliper measurements of both pedicle width and laminar thickness were obtained. On the right side, pedicle screws were first inserted and then pulled out. Salvage intralaminar screws were inserted into the left lamina from the right spinous process/lamina junction and then pulled out. All screws were placed by experienced cervical spine surgeons under direct fluoroscopic visualization. Pedicle and lamina screws were 4.35- and 3.5-mm in diameter, respectively. Screws sizes were chosen based on direct and radiographic measurements of the respective anatomical regions. Insertional torque (IT) was measured in pounds per inch. Tensile loading to failure was performed in-line with the screw axis at a rate of 0.25 mm/sec using a MiniBionix II system with data recorded in Newtons.
All patients with severe CST in the north area of S√£o Paulo City were studied. The data analyzed were age, sex, incidence, causes of trauma, level of trauma, morbidity, deaths, and complications. Analytical tests were performed to study risks of trauma and complications. The chi-square and analysis of variance tests were used for analytical data (significance level p &lt; 0.05).
The authors retrospectively reviewed data from the last 3000 patients with a histological diagnosis of disc herniation. Patients with preoperative MR imaging findings that simulated a spinal tumor or other space-occupying lesion were individually analyzed.
An institutional database of patients undergoing decompressive surgery for MESCC at an academic tertiary-care institution between 1996 and 2006 was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with primary lung, breast, prostate, kidney, or gastrointestinal (GI) cancer or melanoma were identified. Fisher exact and log-rank analyses were used to compare pre-, peri-, and postoperative variables and survival for patients with these different types of primary cancers.
The latencies of lumbar SSEPs were recorded in 40 patients with central LSS, including 16 men and 24 women. The mean age of the patients was 67.3 +/- 7.4 years. The diagnosis was LSS in 23 cases and LSS associated with degenerative spondylolisthesis in 17 cases. The average duration of symptoms was 43.8 +/- 51.2 months. Twenty-two cases had bilateral and 18 cases had unilateral leg symptoms. Thirty-seven cases were associated with neurogenic intermittent claudication and the mean walking distance of patients with this condition was 246.8 +/- 232.7 m. The mean Japanese Orthopedic Association scale score, as well as the visual analog scale (VAS) scores of low-back pain, leg pain, and numbness, were 16.5 +/- 3.5, 6.0 +/- 2.5, 6.9 +/- 2.1, and 7.8 +/- 2.2, respectively. The minimal cross-sectional area of the dural sac on MR imaging was 0.44 +/- 0.21 cm(2). Thirty-nine cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy without lumbar and peripheral neuropathy were chosen as the control group.
The authors evaluated the branches of 20 VAs from 10 adult cadavers and assessed the distribution and surgical significance of the branches from the V2 and V3 segments.
We investigated liver samples obtained from 8 patients with liver failure due to unknown etiology and from 15 patients with metabolic disease: ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, 6 cases; Wilson disease, 3 cases; metylmalonic aciduria (MMA); 3 cases, neonatal hemochromatosis, 2 cases. The estimation of MRC enzymes was carried out by the following independent methods; i) blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) in gel enzyme staining, ii) BN-PAGE western blotting, iii) in vitro MRC enzyme assay. Furthermore, we estimated the quantities of mtDNA and nDNA using qPCR.
A total of 2,129 Korean CB units, donated and processed during the period from August 2007 to December 2007, were enrolled. We measured hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC) count, differential count of WBC, platelets and nucleated red blood cell (nRBC) count by XE-2100 automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex, Japan), and estimated reference value of each parameter by using parametric (Mean+/-2SD) and/or non-parametric methods (2.5-97.5 percentile). And also, we compared the result of each parameter in relation to sex of neonates and delivery method.
Eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia were defined when absolute eosinophil count was greater than 500/microL and 1,500/microL, respectively. Patient's clinical records were reviewed to find out the underlying clinical conditions responsible for causes of hypereosinophilia. Conventional chromosomal analysis, reverse transcriptase PCR and FISH for gene rearrangement were performed to check the presence of clonal eosinophilia.
Based on our preliminary tests using various concentrations of DPA, 200 and 300 microg/mL concentration of DPA were chosen for further study. Bacterial lawns were grown on MHA biplate, one half of which contained DPA while the other did not. The inhibition zone around the imipenem (IPM) disk on both sides of this plate was compared. The stability of DPA in the stored DPA-MHA biplate was also evaluated during three months using two MBL- and one non-MBL-producing isolates.
A total of 113 clinical strains of S. pneumoniae (88 penicillin susceptible strains, 8 intermediate strains, and 17 resistant strains by 2008 CLSI criteria) were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for penicillin, cefotaxime, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and vancomycin were determined by Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden) and Phoenix System. The results obtained by Phoenix system were compared to those obtained by Etest.
During the period of May to June 2005, we collected clinical isolates of E. coli that were intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime from 11 Korean hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. ESBL production was confirmed phenotypically by the double-disk synergy test. ESBL and qnr genes were searched for by PCR amplification, and the PCR products were then subjected to direct sequencing.
Among the patients requested for HBV DNA quantification, 16 patients positive in HBV DNA but negative in HBsAg RIA (BNIBT HBsAg Kit, China) were enrolled. The "a" determinant of HBV S gene was sequenced and clinical characteristics were reviewed. Additional HBsAg assay was performed using Architect HBsAg kit (Abbott laboratories, USA) employing chemiluminescent immunoassay method.
A four-reaction multiplex ASPCR genotyping assay was designed to detect specific nucleotide sequence differences between the six ABO alleles A101, A102, B101, O01, O02, and cis-AB01. The ABO genotypes of 127 randomly chosen samples were determined using the new multiplex ASPCR method.
Forty MPD patients were included in this study. We screened JAK2 V617F and determined the mutant allele burden using JAK2 MutaScreen kit. The mutant allele burden was estimated by six-scaled standards of JAK2 V617F mutant allele (2%, 5%, 12.5%, 31%, 50%, and 78%). For evaluation of test performance, an allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) was carried out in all samples by using Seeplex JAK2 Genotyping kit. We assessed the clinical differences in distinct disease entities of MPDs according to JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden.
Plasma RNA was extracted from 30 patients with NSCLC, 30 patients with benign lung diseases including pulmonary tuberculosis, and 10 healthy controls. Plasma hnRNP B1 mRNA was measured by TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems, USA), and pre-developed beta-actin (ACTB) mRNA was used for normalization. We analyzed the relative gene expression data using the delta-delta Ct method.
Thirty FOBT-positive specimens above 100 ng/mL were used for the study from July to August 2008. Quantitative FOBT was performed with OC-sensors II (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan). Each specimen was divided into 4 groups. Two groups in plastic buffer-free containers were kept either at 4 degrees C or room temperature (25-28 degrees C), respectively. Another two groups in buffer-tubes were also kept either at 4 degrees C or room temperature. Each group was repeatedly examined with same method every 24 hr up to 120 hr.
Between 1997 and 2006 a total of 123 patients (109 with pHPT and 14 with sHPT) underwent parathyroidectomy at the ENT Department in Luzern. Ultrasonographic scanning was performed on 74 patients (68%), szintigraphy in 8 patients (7%) and both scanning methods in 27 patients (25%). 103 patients were available for follow-up. The indications for each technique were reviewed and outcome measures included serum Calcium and parathyroid hormone levels.
Children with suspected APD were examined with a combination of 12 audiological and psychometric tests in order to allow the proper allocation to either the APD-group or to the Non-APD-group.
Forty-six 8-10-year-old children diagnosed with auditory-specific perceptual deficits [clinical group (C)APD; average age 9;2 years; SD 0;7 years] were compared to 39 normally developed children of the same age span with no evidence of specific language impairment, developmental dyslexia or learning disorders [control group Non-APD; average age 9;3 years; SD 0;7 years].
We examined 22 patients with acute stroke (14 men, 8 women, mean age 72.5 years) treated with intravenous rt-PA. All were assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and underwent emergent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within 3 hours and 24 hours of stroke onset. Patients were divided into a deteriorated group (16 patients), in which NIHSS scores were increased after thrombolysis, and a non-deteriorated group (6 patients). We compared the DWI score, ASPECTS, and volume of hyperintense ischemic lesion on DWI (DWI volume) of the 2 groups and examined correlations between these scores and initial NIHSS score or DWI volume.
We created a phantom using a wall of plastic bottles varied with plastic tapes measuring 0.4 to 3.0 mm thick (0-14 sheets) by vernier caliper and compared widths with those on profile curves. In 3 patients, to clarify the capacity to visualize the coronary wall in vulnerable plaque, we acquired WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE and WS-spectral attenuation with inversion recovery (SPAIR) (inversion time [TI] 400 ms) 3D T(1) TFE images of carotid vulnerable plaque; also termed "lipid-rich plaque," vulnerable plaque is considered to be visualized in high intensity. We utilized the same geometric parameters and rest period on WHCA as for WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE. We obtained MIF of WHCA and WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE and measured thickness of the right coronary artery (RCA) wall on the profile curve in 18 cases.
We used a 1.5-tesla MR system with body-array and spine coils to obtain oblique sagittal T(1)-weighted shoulder images of 29 normal adults (16 men, 13 women); 6 national-level competitive swimmers (4 men, 2 women); 10 collegiate-level female badminton players; and 7 collegiate-level male rowers. We calculated the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis CSAs at the 0-1 locations on the scapula (dividing scapula width into 11 locations), 0 representing the medial border of the scapula and 1, the glenoid fossa surface. We evaluated the differences in CSAs at relative locations on the scapula for each muscle in normal adults, swimmers, badminton players, and rowers using a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test (P&lt;0.05).
We performed 3D HP (129)Xe MR imaging of the lungs of 2 healthy and 2 emphysematous mice that were spontaneously breathing diluted HP (129)Xe (&lt;1%). From the three 3D MR images acquired by varying the flip angle of the radiofrequency (RF) pulse, we calculated the time constant of regional recovery, tau'(rep), which represents the time required for HP (129)Xe magnetization to be replenished approximately 63% after destruction of hyperpolarization by RF saturation pulse. After calculating the tau'(rep) maps, we examined the validity of our method.
Posthoc analysis of data was collected from 90 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, randomized to either conventional or TGC groups. Independent of these treatments, patients with at least two organ dysfunctions simultaneously received rh-APC. Plasma levels of multiple biochemical markers for fibrinolysis, coagulation, and inflammation were determined every day for the 1st week and then on study days 9, 11, 13, 18, 23, and 28. Clinical data and sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were also recorded.
A questionnaire was administered to the nurses of four non-intensive wards. The questionnaire addressed several issues, including the extent of the nurses' involvement in the decision to start the treatment, their relationship with the ward physicians and the Medical Emergency Team (MET), the monitoring, incidence, and management of errors and complications, the adhesion to the prescribed ventilatory program, and the desired training.
A randomized clinical trial was performed on 100 outpatients; 50 patients were enrolled in the subarachnoid anesthesia (SA) group and 50 patients in the monitored anesthesia care (MAC) group. Patients in the MAC group received local anesthesia plus target-controlled infusion propofol (LA+TCI). SA was performed using 7.5 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine according to the selective technique. In the LA+TCI group, LA was performed with 20 mL 1% mepivacaine + 10 mL 1% ropivacaine; IV propofol sedation using TCI according to Schnider was used to obtain a Ramsay scale response of 4-5. Transferability from the operating room was evaluated based on an Aldrete score &gt; or =9; ability to discharge from the health facility was evaluated based on a Post-Anesthesia Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) &gt; or =9.
We injected pregnant dams (between E10.5 - E18.5) with anti-angiogenic agents, which caused either a placental insufficiency type of IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction; i.e., TNP-470) or frank placental pathology (Angiostatin(4.5) [AS(4.5)]), and assessed changes in absolute ocular dimensions, tissue types, and vascular profiles using stereological techniques.
We performed Western blotting of protein extracts from normal human glomeruli with serum samples from patients with idiopathic or secondary membranous nephropathy or other proteinuric or autoimmune diseases and from normal controls. We used mass spectrometry to analyze the reactive protein bands and confirmed the identity and location of the target antigen with a monospecific antibody.
We examined fee-for-service Medicare data from 1992 through 2005 to identify beneficiaries 65 years of age or older who underwent CPR in U.S. hospitals. We examined temporal trends in the incidence of CPR and the rate of survival after CPR, as well as patient- and hospital-level predictors of survival to discharge.
We randomly assigned patients who were referred for preoperative staging of NSCLC to either conventional staging plus PET-CT or conventional staging alone. Patients were followed until death or for at least 12 months. The primary end point was the number of futile thoracotomies, defined as any one of the following: a thoracotomy with the finding of pathologically confirmed mediastinal lymph-node involvement (stage IIIA [N2]), stage IIIB or stage IV disease, or a benign lung lesion; an exploratory thoracotomy; or a thoracotomy in a patient who had recurrent disease or death from any cause within 1 year after randomization.
We conducted a multicenter, controlled trial involving 285 normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria and who were randomly assigned to receive losartan (100 mg daily), enalapril (20 mg daily), or placebo and followed for 5 years. The primary end point was a change in the fraction of glomerular volume occupied by mesangium in kidney-biopsy specimens. The retinopathy end point was a progression on a retinopathy severity scale of two steps or more. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed with the use of linear regression and logistic-regression models.
We compared spending for prescription drugs and other medical care 2 years before the implementation of Part D in January 2006 with such expenditures 2 years after the program's implementation in four groups of elderly beneficiaries: Medicare Advantage enrollees with stable, uncapped, employer-based drug coverage throughout the study period (no-cap group), those who had no previous drug coverage, and those who had previous limited benefits (with either a $150 or a $350 quarterly cap) before they were covered by Part D in 2006.
There are many different methods to collect saliva, either directly from the mouth as an expectorate or indirectly by using swabs, capillary tubes or paper foams. The swab may be cotton-based, synthetic, with or without a plastic sheath. There are different methods for analysis - immunological, radioisotopic, mass fragmentographic and chromatographic.
In this study, a patient requiring invasive monitoring for seizure localization underwent concurrent implantation with a 16-microwire array (1-mm electrode spacing) placed over primary motor cortex. Microscale activity was recorded while the patient performed simple contra- and ipsilateral wrist movements that were monitored in parallel with electromyography. Using various statistical methods, linear and nonlinear relationships between these microcortical changes and recorded electromyography activity were defined.
Six patients undergoing invasive monitoring for medically intractable epilepsy using subdural grid electrodes were asked to perform a motor task involving moving a joystick in 1 of 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right) and a fifth condition ("trigger"). Evoked activity was synchronized to joystick movement and analyzed in the theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high-gamma frequency bands.
To form the multifunctional neural probe, the authors affixed a 16-channel microfabricated silicon electrode array to a fused silica catheter. Three experiments were conducted in rats to characterize the performance of the device. Experiment 1 examined cellular damage from probe insertion and the drug distribution in tissue. Experiment 2 measured the effects of saline infusions delivered through the probe on concurrent electrophysiological measurements. Experiment 3 demonstrated that a physiologically relevant amount of drug can be delivered in a controlled fashion. For these experiments, Hoechst and propidium iodide stains were used to assess insertion trauma and the tissue distribution of the infusate. Artificial CSF (aCSF) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) were injected to determine the efficacy of drug delivery.
Arrays of nonpenetrating microwires were implanted over the human motor cortex in 2 patients. The patients performed directed stereotypical reaching movements in 2 directions. The resulting data were used to determine whether the reach direction could be distinguished through a frequency power analysis.
We evaluated the status of lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha- and beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, alpha- and beta-carotene, and fat-soluble vitamins by a quality-controlled high-performance liquid chromatography method in serum of 53 patients. Subjects were consecutively included as they were monitored for nutritional status after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). Average follow-up time was 18 and 14 months for each protocol, respectively.
Serum phenylalanine and alanine aminotransferase (an independent predictor of liver steatosis) concentrations as well as several parameters related to obesity were measured in 16 obese patients (seven men and nine women) before and 6 months after vertical banded gastroplasty. Ten (six men and four women) lean, healthy subjects served as controls.
One hundred ten obese patients (body mass index, 47.9 +/- 8.6 kg/m(2)) undergoing gastric bypass had a measurement of plasma albumin and transthyretin (formerly prealbumin) and a calculation of nutritional risk index (NRI) before and throughout the 2 years following the surgery.
Thirty rats were randomized into normal chow group (NC), high-fat-diet group (HD), and sleeve group (SG). Rats in the SG group received sleeve gastrectomy operation. After operation, rats in SG and HD group received a high-fat diet, while rats in the NC group received normal chow. Body weight was measured every 10 days. Thirty days later, animals were sacrificed and blood samples were collected to check total cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride. Fresh liver sections were made and stained with Nile red and observed under a fluorescence microscope.
BP measurements were recorded prospectively in 100 consecutive patients preoperatively and then postoperatively at weeks 1, 5, 9, and months 6 and 12. In order to reduce bias, three BP measurements were made by the same nurse at each office visit and the mean recorded. Pre- and postoperative usage of antihypertensive medication was also noted.
A total of 156 patients with morbid obesity were included in this prospective study. There were 120 women and 36 men, with a mean age of 41 years and a body mass index of 43 kg/m(2). They were submitted either to a laparotomic resectional gastric bypass or to a laparoscopic gastric bypass. Body temperature was measured every 8 h during 5 days. CPR and white blood cells were measured at the first, third, and fifth day after surgery.
We performed a retrospective review of 75 patients who underwent revisional surgery between December 2003 and October 2007. Demographic, anthropometric, perioperative, and clinical follow-up data were collected, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14.0.
In 26 patients with morbid obesity who underwent bariatric surgery, we analyzed different kinds of lipids and hepatic lipase (HL) from both plasma and liver biopsies performed 12-18 months after surgery.
The "Tip-Stitch" is a low-technology method of orienting the gastric specimen for easy retrieval. A suture through the distal tip of the specimen allows for extraction without enlarging a 15-mm trocar site.
Seventeen patients were studied 2 months after laparoscopic gastric banding. The aims were to evaluate the association between (1) the extent of pouch filling and satiety, (2) gastric emptying and weight loss, and (3) the pouch pressure during a meal and the sensation of satiety and weight loss.
From October 2002 to November 2008, 200 patients underwent LSG. Nineteen patients (9.5%) had a body mass index (BMI) of &gt;60 kg/m(2). A 48-Fr bougie is used to obtain an 80-120-ml gastric pouch. An oversewing running suture to reinforce the staple line was performed in the last 100 cases. The technique adopted to reinforce the staple line is a running suture taken through and through the complete stomach wall.
Patients in a prospective database of morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 2004 and May 2007 were recruited by phone and in clinic. Patient demographics, body mass index (BMI) at surgery, and survey data were collected. The survey included questions regarding their child/grandchild's body habitus, weight, and height. Child obesity was defined as BMI percentile &gt; or =95. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.
Thirty-six individuals were divided into two groups: patients who have kept a healthy weight 2 years after surgery and patients who showed weight regain of at least 2 kg 2 years after the surgery. Selected patients have signed a consent form. Body mass index and excess weight loss were evaluated. RMR and body fat percentage were measured. FFM is a heterogeneous component that can be partitioned into muscle mass and no-muscle mass. The FFM was calculated as the result of subtracting total fat weight from total body weight in kilogram. We also wanted to know if the predictive formulas to assess RMR overestimate energy expenditure in these patients. Statistical tests were used to analyze the two groups.
Sixty-two morbidly obese white women aged 45.3 +/- 8.9 years were studied. Anthropometric measurements, bone mineral density (BMD) screening using dual-energy X- ray absorptiometry and plasma determinations of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D(3)] and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were made prior to and 12 months after surgery.
Data describing peri-interventional characteristics were prospectively documented in an internet online data registry. All primary bariatric procedures performed since January 1st, 2005, were registered. In addition, reoperations in patients who had previously undergone primary surgical intervention were included. As a representative excerpt from the overall prospective multicenter observational study on obesity surgery, data on the type, regimen, and time course of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis were documented. From the number and spectrum of complications, the incidences of clinically manifest DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE) were derived during the in-hospital course and follow-up in conjunction with the type of surgical procedure and body mass index (BMI).
Twenty LAGB patients underwent high-resolution video manometry with the LAGB empty, 20% under, 20% over, and at their optimal volume. Twenty obese controls were also studied. Effects on esophageal motility, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and the gastroesophageal junction were measured. Transit during liquid and semisolid swallows was assessed.
All patients who underwent open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from February 2007 to August 2008 were prospectively evaluated. Blood and peritoneal effluent from the drain were collected for the determination of cytokine levels. We also evaluated the clinical signs and the leukograms of the patients.
Thirty-two morbid obese females were enrolled in the study and evaluated at baseline, 1 and 18 months after LAGB surgery. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, total proteins, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin soluble receptor were evaluated. In addition, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting glucose were also evaluated.
Parotid saliva was collected from cotton rolls positioned in the oral cavity during two baseline water trials and ten lemon juice trials. Data were condensed into trial blocks, representing mean values for the two baseline water trials and each of five pairs of lemon juice trials (i.e., blocks 1-5). Salivary change across lemon juice trials was calculated by subtracting values for blocks 1 through 5 from baseline.
Dyslipidemic patients (n = 156; 83 men) who were non-smokers, did not have diabetes mellitus or evident vascular disease and were not on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive agents were recruited. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. We estimated vascular risk using the Framingham equation.
Fat suppressed oblique sagittal images of the open and closed mouth were acquired, and MRI scanning parameters were applied.
After insertion of a femoral catheter under peripheral nerve stimulation control, 111 patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty or tibial osteotomy were randomized to receive either pre-incisionnal (treatment) or postoperative (control) continuous femoral block. Anesthesia and postoperative management was standardized. An assessor blinded to the randomization process recorded early and late postoperative conditions (POC) which included pain scores, opioid demands, length of stay in Postoperative care unit and patients' satisfaction.
Retrospective chart review of 618 patients seen at our PH clinic from 1991 to June 2008. Data collection focused on patients diagnosed with CTEPH, D-dimer levels, demographics, clinical, and hemodynamics. We compared D-dimer levels in CTEPH patients or World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic group 4 with PH patients in WHO group 1.
Lipids in the retina of normal and diabetic mice were trans-methylated with methanolic HCl. The esters so prepared were analyzed for fatty acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, qualitatively as well as quantitatively.
Microglia were collected from retinas of newborn rats, cultured and treated with LPS in vitro. Microglia were also activated by an optic nerve crush in vivo. Pretreatments with and without alpha-crystallin were performed in cultured cells, and by intravitreal injection in adult rats. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO) and inducible NOS synthase (iNOS) were measured by RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot and the nitrate reductase method.
Retinal neurons were cultured in 4 groups: (1) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), (2) DMEM containing lens extract, (3) DMEM containing macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM-D), (4) DMEM and medium from macrophages grown with lens extract (MCM-L). Neurite outgrowth and neuron survival time were observed. The density of retinal neurons with neurites and the longest neurites of the cells were measured on days 1, 3 and 5.
Of 15 adult rats used, 3 served as non-laser-treated controls. CNV was induced in the right eye of the remaining 12 rats by laser photocoagulation. These 12 rats were divided into two groups (n = 6 each) which were retrobulbarly injected with octreotide (50 miucrog/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.15 ml) immediately and on day 3 after the first injection. Fluorescein angiography and quantitative analysis of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-choroidal flat mounts were performed 14 days after the operation to evaluate the changes in the CNV lesions. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to compare the changes shown by the octreotide-, PBS-, and non-laser-treated rats (n = 3 each) with regard to mRNA levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in the RPE-choroidal complex.
S. epidermidis strains were isolated from patients with conjunctivitis (n = 23), endophthalmitis (n = 14) and corneal ulcers (n = 7). Minimum inhibition concentrations were determined by broth and agar dilution methods for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, balofloxacin, rufloxacin and pazufloxacin. Mutations were identified by sequencing the gyrA and parC genes, and their expression was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Adult cats were perfused intracardially for 1, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min with physiological saline and were subsequently perfused with a mixture of 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde. After the fixation, the retinas were immunocytochemically examined.
We recruited 30 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of exudative AMD with newly diagnosed choroidal neovascularization (CNV), 30 subjects with dry AMD and 30 age- and sex-matched volunteers without AMD. The concentration of C3a-desArg complement compound was measured in the subjects' peripheral blood. We evaluated the association between the level of C3a-desArg and age, sex, smoking, atherosclerosis, and hypertension.
The digital camera has a compound lens consisting of two optical elements (a 90-dpt and a 20-dpt lens) attached to a 7.2-megapixel camera. White-light-emitting diodes are used to illuminate the fundus and reduce source reflection. The camera settings are set to candlelight mode, the optic zoom standardized to x2.4 and the focus is manually set to 3.0 m.
Western blot and immunocytochemistry were performed to confirm gene expression, the MTT assay to detect cell growth, flow cytometry to investigate the cell cycle and the TUNEL to detect cell apoptosis.
Histological, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical studies were performed on skeletal muscle and myocardium of BALB/c mice infected with T. cruzi, RA strain.
The effect and mechanisms of ING4 on proliferation and apoptosis of U87MG were evaluated in vitro by MTT assay, flow-cytometric analysis, TUNEL assay, Western blot analysis and animal experiments.
Twenty-nine patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) and 43 with biliary tract cancer (BTC; 27 cases of bile duct cancer, 8 of gallbladder cancer and 8 of cancer of the papillary area) were included. ELISA was used to assess the concentrations of TS and DPD in cancerous and noncancerous tissues. All 82 patients were followed up at least 12 months after surgery. We compared patient survivals between the 2 groups, taking TS and DPD cutoff as median values, high versus low DPD and high versus low TS in the cancerous tissue of PC and BTC patients.
Small rat bowels were stored in the absence or presence of THP or its synthetic derivative lauryl-THP for 18 h at 4 degrees C. Several biochemical parameters were evaluated following isolated reperfusion in tissue grafts and/or effluent solution. Graft morphology was analyzed by electron microscopy. Ceramide was quantified as a potential target of THP action.
The authors retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with conservatively treated EDH at the Department of Neurosurgery, King Abdulla University Hospital, Irbid, Jordan, between August 2003 and October 2007. All patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14 or 15, and an initial computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrating an EDH with or without skull fractures. Follow-up included neurological examination and brain CT.
Between July 1999 and August 2007, 59 children with posterior fossa tumours were surgically managed. Based on presenting neurology, imaging criteria and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure during ventriculostomy, patients were categorised into no (n = 16), mild (6), moderate (22) or severe (15) hydrocephalus on admission.
In the study, 27 patients (11 males and 16 females, aged 0-6 months) with congenital hydrocephalus were studied. CSF levels were obtained from the patients preoperatively and on postoperative days 3 and 30, and TCD was applied. The level of NGF was investigated in CSF by the ELISA method. The pulsatility index (PI) and resistive index (RI) were examined in the right middle cerebral artery by TCD.
Dysraphism was surgically created in 2 groups of 48 rat fetuses; group 1: control, and group 2: treated with corticosteroid. Each group was subdivided into fetuses with surgically created MM, controls and shams on day 18.5 of gestation (term = 22 days). Fetuses were harvested on day 21.5, examined for evidence of neurological deficits, and the following clinical parameters were registered: kyphosis, tail deformities, leg deformities, leg paralysis or paresis and pain perception. The fetuses were fixed for GFAP immunostaining.
A national random sample of 15-year-olds (n = 996) was followed up after four and twelve years respectively in a longitudinal study in Denmark; 614 persons completed questionnaires in all three waves. The main outcome measure was medicine use for headache within the past 14 days.
Annual, national suicide mortality rates from 1990 to 2006 for 10-19 year-olds in World Health Organisation (WHO) Mortality Stratum A countries were studied using the WHO mortality database. Departures from country-specific trends in 2004-2006 relative to overall trends 1990-2006 were calculated to estimate the impact of regulatory actions in 2003/4.
We conducted a case-control study among members of an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State. Cases (N = 641) were diagnosed with CRC between 2000 and 2003; controls (N = 641) were randomly selected from enrollees and matched to cases on age, sex, and length of enrollment. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CRC associated with the use of any acid suppressive medication, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) only, histamine receptor antagonists (H2 blockers) only, or both PPIs and H2 blockers in relation to the use of neither PPIs nor H2 blockers.
We obtained the complete Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX) files for the State of Michigan between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2003. We tracked the adoption of: aripiprazole, atomoxetine, escitalopram, methylphenidate OROS, and ziprasidone. We conducted retrospective, space-time analyses, scanning for clusters with high rates of prescribing. Chi(2) analyses were used to compare the attributes of patients living within clusters to patients living in the rest of the state for each medication. Clusters of utilization were identified via the spatial scan statistic. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then used to compare the numbers of mental health professionals per capita in geographic areas that did and did not demonstrate clustering of prescriptions for new psychotropic medications.
This study was carried out in 62 hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, between May and August, 2007, using a closed and choice questionnaire. The data were entered using the EpiData3.1 software and analyzed by chi (2)-test, single-factor analysis, and multi-factor logistic regression using the SAS9.1 software.
Infants participated in the WHeezing Illnesses STudy LEidsche Rijn (WHISTLER), a prospective birth cohort on respiratory illnesses. Outcome was defined as having received a prescription of antibiotics or of anti-asthma medication for respiratory symptoms by a physician.
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a population-based prospective cohort study of 6814 US adults from 4 different ethnic groups. After excluding baseline users of ADM, we examined the relation between baseline depression and new use of ADM for 4 different ethnicities: African-Americans (n = 1822), Asians (n = 784) Caucasians (n = 2300), and Hispanics (n = 1405). Estimates of the association of ethnicity and ADM use were adjusted for age, study site, gender, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), alcohol use, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, education, and exercise. Non-random loss to follow-up was present and estimates were adjusted using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW).
Eighty-four qualitative in-depth telephone interviews were conducted; 50 with health plan members, 21 with providers, and 13 with purchasers. Interviews focused on stakeholders' concerns about and recommendations for conducting CRTs in health plans.
A single center, retrospective cohort study examined different HAART regimens and total cholesterol (TC) levels. The primary outcomes were TC levels &gt; 180, &gt; 200 mg/dl. HAART was defined as multiple nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), NRTI and protease inhibitor (PI) combinations (NRTI/PI), and NRTI and non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) combinations (NRTI/NNRTI). Controls were HIV-1 infected children while on no medications (No MED). Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models generated hazard ratios for each of the primary outcomes with duration of therapy in the model.
Data on 4,163,045 prescriptions of psychotropic drugs dispensed at all pharmacies in Norway during 2005 were extracted from The Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD), including antipsychotics (ATC-code N05A), anxiolytics (N05B), hypnotics (N05C) and antidepressants (N06A). This information was merged with data concerning the 3857 general practitioners (GPs) from the Norwegian Regular GP Scheme.
We studied reports recorded in the French Pharmacovigilance database and the GERAP database over a 12-year period (1995-2006). For each report, we detailed the clinical features and skin tests used. Delayed or immediate-type allergic reactions and cross-reactivity between amide type local anesthetics were also analyzed.
A population-based cohort study was conducted in the IPCI database (1995-2007). The index cohort comprised all persons who started an anti-obesity drug. The reference cohort comprised up to six randomly sampled patients from the same GP practice with same index date. Baseline characteristics were assessed for both cohorts. The index cohort was followed for 1 year to study patterns of drug use. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
For 143 well-known photosensitisers (e.g. tetracyclines, diuretics), we retrieved information on spectroscopic and molecular parameters, including: absorption maximum lambda(max), molar absorption coefficient epsilon, area under the absorption curve (AUC), molecular weight and configuration, hetero and aromatic halogen atoms, lipophilicity (log P) and acid/base status (pKa). In the WHO-ADR database, all reports with suspected adverse drug reactions of the study drugs were selected. We identified all reports on photosensitivity reactions and defined them as cases. All other reports were selected as non-cases. A case-non-case approach was performed to assess the spectroscopic and molecular exposure variables as a factor for photosensitivity reactions. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Prospective, observational study for a period of 1 year in medical ICU of a tertiary care hospital. Relevant data of patients with ADRS were analysed. Characteristics of patients with and without ADRs were compared.
The 'physician preference' instrument correlates well with the treatment only if physician preferences affect the treatment received by a large fraction of patients. Yet, often there is a subgroup of patients whose treatment cannot be affected by physician's preferences. The larger this subgroup is, the weaker the instrument. We investigated the impact of weakening this instrument on the performance of IV estimates, by comparing risk difference estimates from the conventional and IV analyses in the presence of an unobserved confounder, for both continuous and binary outcomes.
The present study involves in-vitro autofluorescence monitoring of different human brain tumor samples to assess their spectroscopic properties. The autofluorescence measurement at four different excitation wavelengths 320, 370, 410, and 470 nm, were carried out for five different brain tumor types: glioma, astrocytoma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, and schwannoma.
Adult male albino rats were divided into three groups: control rats, pilocarpinized rats (epileptic animal model), and pilocarpinized rats treated daily with laser irradiation (90 mW at 830 nm) for 7 d. The following parameters were assayed in cortex and hippocampus: amino acid neurotransmitters (excitatory: glutamic acid and aspartate; and inhibitory: gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], glycine, and taurine) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), glucose content, and the activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), using a spectrophotometer.
Seventy Wistar rats were used and divided into seven groups of 10 rats each: group 1, sham laser treatment; group 2, which received irradiation at 1 point 5 cm from the flap's cranial base; group 3, which received irradiation at 2 points (5 and 7.5 cm from the flap's base); group 4, which received irradiation at 3 points (2.5, 5 and 7.5 cm from the flap's base); group 5, which received irradiation at 1 point 2.5 cm from the flap's base; group 6, which received irradiation at 2 points (2.5 and 5 cm from the flap's base); and group 7, which received irradiation at 1 point 7.5 cm from the flap's base. The animals were subjected to laser therapy at an energy density of 36 J/cm(2) for 72 sec immediately after surgery, and one time on each of the four subsequent days. The percentage of necrotic skin flap area was calculated on the seventh postoperative day using a paper template.
Digital analysis of standardized pre- and post-treatment digital photographs of a total of 90 maxillary incisors from 23 adult patients undergoing photodynamic bleaching was undertaken. The patients were treated by a visible green KTP laser (wavelength 532 nm) combined with a rhodamine-B photosensitizer gel (Smartbleach) applied to the teeth and activated for 30 sec. Each tooth underwent four cycles of 30 sec of laser exposure. Digital image analysis was undertaken in a blinded manner, and we examined changes in the four maxillary incisors in terms of blue pixel intensity (yellowness).
Dentine specimens prepared from extracted human third molars were randomly assigned to six groups, including one receiving phosphoric acid etching, and five others with different laser parameters: 5 W for 30 sec, 2.5 W for 30 sec, 2.5 W for 60 sec, 1.5 W for 30 sec, and 1.5 W for 100 sec. Surface morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Average roughness (Ra) was determined with a profilometer. Bonding of resin composites to the dentine specimens was tested in shear mode.
A prospective blind study was made of 60 Sprague-Dawley rats divided into two groups after the creation of tongue lesions using the CO(2) laser. Nothing was applied to the resulting wounds in the first group, while PRGF was applied to the 30 wounds in the second group. Wound re-epithelialization and inflammation were measured after 7, 14, and 28 d.
Two Y-TZP materials were evaluated: Cercon Smart Ceramics and Procera Zirconia. Thirty plates from each ceramic material were randomly divided into five groups according to the surface treatment received (none [control], air abrasion, or irradiation with the Er:YAG laser at three different energy intensities [200, 400, or 600 mJ]). After the surface treatments, the ceramic plates were gold-coated and their surface roughness (Ra, microm) was measured using confocal microscopy. For each ceramic system, the surface roughness was analyzed through two-way ANOVA/Tukey's test, with a 5% significance level. Changes in the morphological characteristics of the ceramics were examined through light and scanning electron microscopy.
Twenty healthy women scheduled for cesarean section were randomly divided into two groups: an LLLT group and a control group. LLLT was delivered as follows: (1) irradiation with 980 nm (100 mW, 3.3 J/cm(2), total energy 60 J), and 650 nm (30 mW, 1.5 J/cm(2), total energy 27 J) to the incision line, and (2) intravenous laser irradiation at 2.5 mW and 650 nm for 15 min on three consecutive postoperative days. Except for LLLT, all the therapeutic conditions in both groups were identical. Blood prolactin levels were measured in the groups on the third postoperative day, and tissue samples were taken from the wound margins for histological evaluation on the 10th postoperative day.
A double-blind controlled clinical trial was performed on 152 patients with knee pain who were randomly assigned into two different groups. Group I patients (n = 76) received interferential laser therapy generated by two identical laser probes located opposite each other on the knee joint. Group II patients (n = 76) received one live probe in conventional laser therapy and one dummy probe. The device used in both groups was an AlGaAs laser (wavelength 810 nm, power 100 mW, in continuous mode). Fifteen laser sessions were applied transcutaneously on 5 knee points (6 J/point) per session. In addition, patients in both groups received a quadriceps strength program based on isometric exercises. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation in different situations, such as in standing, in knee flexion/extension, and when going up and down stairs. VAS pain scores were evaluated before, in the middle of, and after treatment.
MSCs were irradiated with a blue laser (wavelength 405 nm) for 180 sec via a fiber attached to the bottom of the culture dish.

Intracellular hematoporphyrin was monitored with a confocal microscope, and Western blot and caspase activity assays were performed.
One hundred nineteen permanent molars were assessed by two experienced dentists using the LF and the LFpen devices, both with and without PVC wrapping. The teeth were histologically prepared and assessed for caries extension.
Patients with unilateral LET for at least 4 wk were sequentially allocated to receive either an exercise program with LLLT or an exercise program with polarized polychromatic non-coherent light. The exercise program consisted of eccentric and static stretching exercises of wrist extensors. In the LLLT group a 904-nm Ga-As laser was used in continuous mode, and the power density was 130 mW/cm(2), and the dose was 0.585 J/point. In the group receiving polarized polychromatic non-coherent light the Bioptron 2 was used to administer the dose perpendicularly to the lateral epicondyle at three points at an operating distance of 5-10 cm for 6 min at each position. The outcome measures were pain and function and were evaluated at baseline, at the end of the treatment (week 4), and 3 mo after the end of treatment (week 16).
The authors detail their experience with welding using an Nd:YAG fiberoptic-delivered laser that is normally used for dental therapy.
Irradiation was performed at two time points: T0 (24 h after cell culture) and T48 (48 h after the first irradiation). Cellular viability was assessed using an MTT assay at the following times: T0 (first irradiation), T6 (6 h after the first irradiation), T12 (12 h after the first irradiation), T24 (24 h after the first irradiation), T48 (48 h after the first irradiation), and T72 (72 h after the first irradiation). The results were analyzed using Graphpad Prism software.
One hundred and sixty samples of human caries-free premolars were immersed in pH-cycling solution (pH = 5) for 2 d for decalcified lesion formation. Then the tooth samples were randomly divided into eight groups and the lesions were treated using the different modalities: a control group, an APF only group, an APF = Nd:YAG laser group, and APF = CO(2) laser group, an Nd:YAG laser = APF group, a CO(2) laser = APF group, a CO(2) laser only group, and an Nd:YAG laser only group. The energy density setting for the two types of lasers was 83.33 J/cm(2). After treatment the tooth samples were immersed in pH-cycling solution again for 2 d for acid challenge. As for the acid-resistance evaluation, the calcium concentration dissolved from the enamel surface was analyzed by an electrolyte analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to assess morphologic changes and polarized light microscopy (PLM) was used to evaluate optical changes in the lesions.
L929 fibroblast cell cultures were irradiated with LLLT and subjected to LIPUS. Cultures irradiated with the laser (904 nm) were divided into three groups: group I, control (no irradiation); group II, irradiated at 6 J/cm(2); and group III, irradiated at 50 mJ/cm(2). Cultures subjected to ultrasound were divided into five groups: group I, control (no LIPUS); group II, LIPUS at 0.2 W/cm(2) in pulsed mode at 10% (1:9 duty cycle); group III, LIPUS at 0.6 W/cm(2) in pulsed mode at 10% (1:9 duty cycle); group IV, LIPUS at 0.2 W/cm(2) in pulsed mode at 20% (2:8 duty cycle); and group V, LIPUS at 0.6 W/cm(2) in pulsed mode at 20% (2:8 duty cycle). Each group was irradiated at 24-h intervals, with the following post-treatment incubation times: 24, 48, and 72 h. The effects of LLLT and LIPUS on the cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum was evaluated by the use of fluorescent probes and with fluorescence microscopy analysis.
Twenty-five neuropsychological studies comparing subjects with adult ADHD and healthy controls were evaluated. Statistical effect size was determined to characterize the difference between ADHD and control subjects.

In this cross-sectional study we recruited consecutive psychiatric admissions to the Maudsley Hospital, London. We carried out structured assessments of decision making using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T), resulting in a clinical judgement about capacity status. We analysed associations with a range of sociodemographic and clinical variables, including insight score on the Expanded Schedule for the Assessment of Insight (SAI-E). The same variables were compared in an analysis stratified according to diagnostic group: psychotic disorders/bipolar affective disorder (BPAD)/non-psychotic disorders.
We analysed cross-sectional data from a large, randomly selected cohort of UK military personnel deployed to Iraq (n=5869). Two markers of PCS were generated: 'PCS symptoms' (indicating the presence of mTBI-related symptoms: none, 1-2, 3+) and 'PCS symptom severity' (indicating the presence of mTBI-related symptoms at either a moderate or severe level of severity: none, 1-2, 3+).
Data came from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a nationally representative US household survey that retrospectively assessed lifetime history and age of onset of DSM-IV mental and substance disorders. Survival analysis using retrospective age-of-onset reports was used to estimate associations of mental disorders with subsequent substance dependence. Simulations based on the models estimated effect sizes in several hypothetical intervention scenarios.
A decision analysis method was used to estimate the number of suicides prevented or induced by ADT in children and adolescents (10-19 years old), adults (20-64 years old) and the elderly (65 years) diagnosed with major depression. The impact of gender and parasuicide history on the findings was explored within each age group. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the models.

Representation, its shortcomings and the way they may affect clinical/research programs undergo a conceptual analysis, which shows how representational-founded semiology leave out information that is essential for symptom specificity and correct symptom assessment. Schizophrenic autism, delusional perception and axial syndromes are studied as examples of both the difficulties that have arisen and possible ways of dealing with them.
Participants were 68 young persons with major depressive disorder. Twenty-six patients also met the criteria of attenuated or brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms according to the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States (CAARMS) criteria. Subjective experiences were assessed with the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms (BSABS). Recognition of complex social emotions and mental states was assessed using the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test.

Pearson correlation, multiple logistic regression, multivariate linear regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used.
Theory-based behavioural nutrition and physical activity interventions aim at changing mediating variables that are hypothesized to be responsible for changes in the outcome of interest. MVA are useful because they help to identify the most promising theoretical approaches, mediators and intervention components for behaviour change. However, the current literature suggests that MVA are often inappropriately conducted, poorly understood and inadequately presented. Main problems encountered in the published literature are explained and suggestions for overcoming weaknesses of current practice are proposed.

Survey, cross-sectional.
Weight and height were measured in 12,556 children taking part in the obligatory school entrance health examination 2004-5 and 2005-6 in three urban and three rural Bavarian regions. Their parents were asked to answer a questionnaire with a set of questions on physical activity.
Survey of 300 mothers of 2-year-old children from areas of high deprivation in Scotland (response rate 81 %). A diet quality score was derived from reported consumption of carbohydrates, protein, fruit and vegetables, dairy products and restriction of sugary fatty foods.
Dietary patterns were assessed using FFQ on a representative sample (n 1200) of the BI and GI (n 1324) adult population. A Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was calculated according to the consumption of nine MDP components: (i) with a beneficial effect on health, i.e. vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals, legumes, fish and shellfish, MUFA:SFA ratio, and moderate alcohol consumption; and (ii) with a detrimental effect on health, i.e. meat and meat products, and milk and dairy products. Persons with consumption of beneficial components below the median (GI plus BI) received a value of 0 and those with consumption above the median a value of 1. Persons with below-median consumption of detrimental components received a value of 1 and above-median consumption a value of 0. For alcohol, a value of 1 was given to consumptions of 10-50 g/d (men) and 5-25 g/d (women). The range of the MDS was 0-9, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to the MDP.

A review of the literature and consideration of the determinants of effective public health nutrition practice has been used to inform the development of a conceptual framework for capacity building in the context of public health nutrition practice.
Participating schoolchildren (mean age 9.9 years at baseline) and their parents completed parallel questionnaires at baseline, at 1-year and at 2-year follow-up, including questions on usual F&amp;V intake of the child, potential behavioural determinants, their appreciation of the project and general demographics. Primary outcomes were usual F&amp;V intakes as assessed by parent and child self-reported food frequency measures. Secondary outcome measures were taste preference, knowledge of daily recommendations, availability and accessibility for fruit intake. Multilevel linear regression analyses were used to assess differences at second follow-up adjusted for baseline values between control and intervention groups.
Reports were available for 346 intervention children (148 parents) and 425 control children (287 parents).
Cross-sectional food consumption data from the Korean National Nutrition Survey Reports (KNNSR) of South Korea at four separate time points (1969, 1978, 1988 and 1998) were used to calculate Zn, Ca and phytate intakes using various food composition tables, databases and literature values. Nutrient values in local foods were cited from their analysed values.
Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test (i) the relationships between 30 d fish frequency consumption and five CHD risk markers, i.e. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, TAG and C-reactive protein (CRP); and (ii) if total blood Hg attenuated any associations between fish consumption and CHD risk markers in non-pregnant, non-diabetic females aged 16-49 years.

Patients were stratified by pre-operative BMI as normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)), obese (30.0-34.9 kg/m(2)) and morbidly obese (&gt; or =35.0 kg/m(2)). Of 5642 patients, 1362 (24.1 %) patients had a normal BMI, 2146 (38.0 %) were overweight, 1342 (23.8 %) were obese and 792 (14.0 %) were morbidly obese.
We examined image quality on CT exams performed in patients with hip arthroplasties as well as other types of implanted metal orthopedic devices. The exam raw data were reconstructed using two different methods, the standard filtered backprojection (FBP) program and the MAR program. Images were evaluated for quality of the metal-cement-bone interfaces, trabeculae &lt; or = 1 cm from the metal, trabeculae 5 cm apart from the metal, streak artifact, and overall soft tissue detail. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare the image scores from the large and small prostheses. Interobserver agreement was calculated.
A retrospective billing database search identified 544 patients who had been diagnosed with patellar instability over a 13-year period. One hundred twenty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. After review by a staff orthopedic surgeon and two musculoskeletal radiologists, 28 patients were found to have medial patellar ossification. The size and location of medial patellar ossification was recorded.
From 122 patients with histologically proven enchondromas and two patients without histology but with radiologic and clinical follow-up, 11 patients with small, eccentrically located chondromas in the long bones had cross-sectional imaging available. The lesions were evaluated for location, size, presence, and degree of cortical scalloping. The patient's medical charts and microscope slides were reviewed for relevant clinical history, clinical management, and histology.
A multiinstitutional retrospective review was performed on seven patients. The patient population consisted of one family with an affected mother and two siblings and four unrelated patients; there were one adult, aged 40 years, and six children, ranging in age from 3 to 12 years. The gender ratio of females to males was 5 to 2. We reviewed the clinical data and skeletal surveys and focused on radiographs of the pelvis, knees, hands, and spine.
Optimized MRI sequences for cartilage imaging at 3.0 T were tailored for 7.0 T: an intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo (IM-w FSE), a fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) and a T1-weighted 3D high-spatial-resolution volumetric fat-suppressed spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequence. Three healthy subjects and seven patients with mild OA were examined. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), diagnostic confidence in assessing cartilage abnormalities, and image quality were determined. Abnormalities were assessed with the whole organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS). Focal cartilage lesions and bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) were also quantified.
Ten healthy volunteers (mean age, 32.4 years) and 12 patients who underwent MACT of the ankle joint (mean age, 32.8 years) were included. In order to evaluate possible maturation effects, patients were separated into short-term (6-13 months) and long-term (20-54 months) follow-up cohorts. MRI was performed on a 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner using a new dedicated eight-channel foot-and-ankle coil. Using high-resolution morphological MRI, the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was assessed. For biochemical MRI, T2 mapping, T2* mapping, and DWI were obtained. Region-of-interest analysis was performed within native cartilage of the volunteers and control cartilage as well as cartilage repair tissue in the patients subsequent to MACT.
Twenty-six patients were identified retrospectively as having comparative 1.5 and 3.0 T MR studies of the knee within an average of 102 days. Standard protocols included T1-weighted and fat-saturated intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo sequences in three planes; sequence parameters had been adjusted to account for differences in relaxation at 3.0 T. Arthroscopy was performed in 19 patients. Four radiologists reviewed each study independently, scored image quality, and analyzed pathological findings. Sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies in diagnosing cartilage lesions were calculated in the 19 patients with arthroscopy, and differences between 1.5 and 3.0 T exams were compared using paired Student's t tests with a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05.

Non-randomized pilot trial.
Outpatient SCI clinic in a Veterans Affairs hospital (USA).
Participants had neurogenic bladders secondary to SCI, were practicing ICP, had experienced at least one UTI and had documented bacteruria within the past year. All participants received a urinary catheter that had been pre-inoculated with E. coli 83972. The catheter was left in place for 3 days and then removed. Participants were followed with urine cultures and telephone calls weekly for 28 days and then monthly until E. coli 83972 was lost from the urine. Outcome measures were (1) the rate of successful bladder colonization, defined as the detection (&gt;or=10(2) cfu ml(-1)) of E. coli 83972 in urine cultures for &gt;3 days after catheter removal and (2) the rate of symptomatic UTI during colonization with E. coli 83972.

All experiments were performed at the Plataforma Solar de Almer√≠a, located in the Tabernas Desert (Southern Spain) in July and October 2007. Turbid water samples [5, 100 and 300 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)] were prepared by addition of red soil to distilled water, and then spiked with purified C. parvum oocysts. PET bottles containing the contaminated turbid waters were exposed to full sunlight for 4, 8 and 12 h. The samples were then concentrated by filtration and the oocyst viability was determined by inclusion/exclusion of the fluorogenic vital dye propidium iodide. Results After an exposure time of 12 h (cumulative global dose of 28.28 MJ/m(2); cumulative UV dose of 1037.06 kJ/m(2)) the oocyst viabilities were 11.54%, 25.96%, 41.50% and 52.80% for turbidity levels of 0, 5, 100 and 300 NTU, respectively, being significantly lower than the viability of the initial isolate (P &lt; 0.01).

Cross-sectional study in Walukuba Division bordering Lake Victoria, Jinja District. We assessed a random sample of 463 individuals aged 10-20 years for Schistosoma mansoni infection, water contact behaviour and treatment status with praziquantel as of the last mass treatment. Socioeconomic conditions of the participants' households were assessed by calculating a wealth index (based on type of housing and ownership of assets). Households were classified in four classes; multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of being infected with schistosomiasis. Intensities of infection with S. mansoni were compared across the classes of wealth index.

Ninety-five healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 225-250 g were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group (I, n=8); normal saline group (II, n=29); rAAV-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) group (III, n=29) and rAAV-rHO-1 group (IV, n=29). In II, III and IV groups, 600 mul of normal saline, rAAV-EGFP or rAAV-rHO-1 was injected intra-myocardial at four sites on the anterior and posterior walls of left ventricle. After 3 months, 3 animals in each group were sacrificed. EGFP-expression in heart sections was observed under fluorescence microscope. The expression of HO-1 in the injected myocardium was detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The remaining animals in the four groups were anesthetized, tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated. I/R of myocardium was producing by blocking the left anterior descending branch of coronary artery (LAD) for 30 minutes followed by 120 minutes reperfusion. After the successful reproduction of the model, the animals were killed and their hearts were harvested for determination of myocardial infarct size, apoptotic index (AI), and pathology changes in myocardial tissue.

Frequency of haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium of PECAM-1 gene in different groups were analyzed by SHEsis programs.
Twenty-six patients with sudden cardiac arrest received CPR, and those patients who had blood circulation maintained for over 24 hours were included. The expression of CK-MB and cTnI activation in peripheral blood were determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours after CPR in all patients. Electrocardiogram was checked every 2 hours in all patients. If CK-MB, cTnI and ST segment of electrocardiogram was higher than usual, or myocardial infarct with suspicious elevation of ST (STEMI), coronary arteriography and interventional therapy were carried out immediately. Patients were divided into three groups. The patients who were not found to have coronary artery block were classified as group A (15 cases), those who were found to have coronary artery block were group B (6 cases), and the remaining patients in whom ST segment of electrocardiogram did not elevate, and coronary arteriography and interventional therapy were not consider were classified as group C (5 cases). Control group consisted of 15 healthy people (group D). The change in CK-MB and cTnI in peripheral blood and the elevation of electrocardiogram ST segment were analyzed.
Rats were randomly divided into three groups: the sham-operated group, the resuscitation control group, and the resuscitation treatment group. Cardiac arrest was produced by clamping the endotracheal intubation, and CPR was executed 1 minute later. In the resuscitation treatment group, SB-3CT (25 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally after the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The rats were executed immediately, and 0, 3, 9, 24 and 48 hours after the treatment. BBB was examined, and the expression of MMP-9 protein and MMP-9 mRNA in brain tissue were detected, and the ultrastructure of brain tissue was studied with electron microscopy.
The bone marrow of the extremities of the rats was flushed, and bone marrow MSCs were obtained by method of density gradient centrifugation. They were cultured. The second passage of cultured MSCs were labelled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The cardiac myocytes were obtained from the apex of rat heart with trypsin digestion method, and they were cocultured with labeled MSCs. The developmental changes of bone marrow MSCs were observed under light microscope with immunohistochemical staining for BrdU and alpha-sarcomeric actin on the 3rd day, and electron microscopic examination on the 5th day.
One hundred and eighty-three patients in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College were prospectively studied. The patients were divided into two groups according to the different ways of out-hospital care, one group consisted of patients who received first-aid care after calling "120" (94 cases), another was self-aid group consisting of patients sent to hospital by relatives (89 cases). The proportion of persons with higher than high school education and better knowledge for emergency care of patients with heart disease in first-aid group was higher than self-aid group (50.0% vs. 29.2%, 83.0% vs. 60.7%, both P&lt;0.05). When the patients were brought to the emergency room, they were all treated according to our standard procedure and then registered. All patients were followed up at the end of first and third month after illness.
Human renal proximal tubular cell line HK-2 cell was used as target cell. They were divided into three groups: control group, asphyxia group and Ucf-101 (Omi/HtrA2 special inhibitor) treated group.

To characterize the properties of the YCP receptor, carbohydrates and antibodies were used to inhibit the binding of fl-YCP to macrophages. Moreover, we investigated the role of membrane receptors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) and complement receptor 3 (CR3). We also examined the role of the p38 kinase pathway in mediating nitric oxide (NO) production.
The antiviral activity of arbidol in vitro was determined by plaque-forming assay, ranging from 0.5 to 8 microg/mL. To investigate whether arbidol has an antiviral effect in vivo, suckling BALB/c mice infected with HTNV were treated with arbidol at 24 h before infection with a 5, 10 or 20 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), once per day, for 10 days. On day 12 and 28 post infection (pi), histopathological changes and viral antigen were detected. On days 4, 8, 12, and 16 pi, the viral load of target organs and serum TNF-alpha levels of arbidol-treated animals were determined.
A 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay was used to determine the degree of growth inhibition by the drugs analyzed in this study.

We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 1997 to 2006. We studied wait times for acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH). Diagnosis was based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Racial/ethnic categories were defined as non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic White (HW). Wait time was stratified by racial/ethnic group and by study year. We evaluated the association between race/ethnicity and frequency of delay relative to triage assignment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the impact of age, sex, payment status, and geography on wait time.

The test group received HCA by topical spray once daily for 7 days, while the control group did not. Pruritic events (time and frequency) were videotaped and then scored. Clinical signs (erythema, papules, excoriation and alopecia) present on four anatomical regions were monitored and their severity directly assessed.
We recruited 43 cats and 50 dogs for the study; 11 cats and 4 dogs were excluded from the statistical analysis because of abnormalities on clinical examination or laboratory testing including anaemia, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), or insufficient plasma volume for comprehensive laboratory coagulation testing.
Blood samples were collected via direct venipuncture for MAX-ACT, packed cell volume/total solids, manual platelet estimation and PT/APTT measurement. Blood (0.5 mL) was mixed gently in the MAX-ACT tube at 37 degrees C for 30 s, then assessed for clot formation every 5 to 10 s by tipping the tube gently on its side and monitoring for magnet movement. The endpoint was defined as the magnet lodging in the clot. The technique was tested with 10 dogs by collecting two blood samples from the same needle insertion and running a MAX-ACT on each simultaneously.

The expression of alpha 2, 3-linked sialic acid residues in 100 cases of gastric cancer samples was evaluated using Maackia amurensis leukoagglutinin (MAL) histochemical staining analysis. The assays of cytochemical staining and flow cytometry were employed to determine the MAL positive cells in the gastric cancer cell lines. The activities of invasion and migration were evaluated using the assays of cell adhesion and transwell chamber.
The study consisted in the comparison of 96 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) cases and 222 controls without HCC matched for age, gender and ethnicity. PCR-RFLP and sequencing methods were used to determine the genotype at the MDM2 SNP309T&gt;G locus.
All pathology reports for oral (ICD-O-3 C01-C06) soft tissue biopsies generated during 1/2004-5/2005 by seven PR and two New York City (NYC) pathology laboratories were reviewed. The analysis was restricted to persons diagnosed with invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), epithelial dysplasia, or hyperkeratosis/epithelial hyperplasia (HK/EH), i.e., diagnoses associated with lesions clinically suspicious for OC/precancer. The OC relative frequency measured the percentage of persons diagnosed with OSCC among persons with OSCC, dysplasia, or HK/EH. OC relative frequencies for PR and NYC laboratories were compared.
Data from a cohort of women were evaluated for regularity of screening and ethnicity utilizing multi-category logistic regression models to investigate Pap test and biopsy results.
We conducted a case-control analysis of 150 subjects with lung cancer and 329 controls with no personal history of the disease. The three statistically inferred GSTP1 promoter haplotypes were confirmed experimentally through cloning and sequencing. Haplotype-tagging SNPs were selected and GSTP1 haplotypes were tested for genetic association to lung cancer using unconditional logistic regression after adjusting for confounders. Statistical interaction between GSTP1 promoter haplotypes with either cigarette smoking or dietary fruit and vegetable intake were tested using the likelihood ratio test.
We extracted data from 12 case-control studies, three cohort studies, and the Pooling Project of Diet and Cancer publication for which 13 international cohorts were evaluated. Random effects meta-analysis models were used to calculate summary relative risk estimates (SRRE) based on high vs. low intake values. Sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted, including assessments of heterogeneity.
In a hospital-based case-control study of 208 cases and 212 controls matched on age and gender, genotypes were determined by PCR-based methods. Risks were evaluated by unconditional logistic regression analysis.
Ten healthy volunteers (all male) were included in the study, based on their haematocrit levels (42.6 +/- 0.96). Using a heparinised 50-ml syringe, 40 cm(3) of blood were drawn from the antecubital veins of fasting volunteers. Six ml of blood were haemodiluted with 2 ml of albumin (20%), 2 ml of Ringer's lactate containing albumin (1.3%), and 2 ml of Ringer's lactate, in order to simulate cardiopulmonary bypass conditions. Test tubes with the solutions were placed in a 15 degrees C water bath for 25 minutes. Viscosity was measured in the haemodiluted blood samples using an Ostwald viscometer. Relative viscosities of samples were assessed with SPSS software and the ANOVA test.
Clinical data on patients subjected to a prosthetic above-the-knee femoro-popliteal bypass for atherothrombotic disease over a four-year period in the Durban Metropolitan Vascular Service were culled from a prospectively maintained computerised database. The patients were divided into two groups, diabetic and non-diabetic.
Two-dimensional, guided M-mode echocardiography including Doppler was performed in 150 consecutive, newly diagnosed hypertensive individuals and normotensive controls aged between 35 and 74 years. Left ventricular mass index and relative wall thickness were used to classify the hypertensive individuals into four geometric patterns, and the pulsed-wave Doppler parameters obtained were used to categorise the abnormalities of diastolic function.
We analysed data from 123 patients who were on regular haemodialysis, by means of traditional transthoracic echocardiographic examination. The usual statistical parameters, correlations and the Student's t-test were performed, with levels of significance of p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted. A multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression was conducted of clinical, surgical and laboratory factors which may be associated with a CK exceeding five times the upper limit of normal (ULN).
Cross-sectional observational study.
Large primary care clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin, USA.
Convenience sample of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and a range of edema severity, including patients without edema.
Eight methods of edema assessment were evaluated: (1) clinical assessment of pit depth and recovery at three locations, (2) patient questionnaire, (3) ankle circumference, (4) figure-of-eight (ankle circumference using eight ankle/foot landmarks), (5) edema tester (plastic card with holes of varying size pressed to the ankle with a blood pressure cuff), (6) modified edema tester (edema tester with bumps), (7) indirect leg volume (by series of ankle/leg circumferences), and (8) foot/ankle volumetry by water displacement. Patients were evaluated independently by three nurse examiners.

A United States Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System outpatient setting.
Adults with type 2 diabetes and asthma or COPD.
Subjects (n=12) were randomized to receive either inhaled fluticasone propionate (440 microg twice daily) and oral placebo, or inhaled placebo and oral montelukast (10 mg/day). After 6 weeks, subjects were switched to the opposite therapy for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change in the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (%HbA1c) at 6 weeks relative to the baseline value.
A 7-year retrospective study of 1134 invasive breast cancer subjects. Clinical and pathologic features and survival of the four subtypes were compared.
One hundred and thirty-two patients with middle or inferior rectal cancer were admitted to our unit and underwent TME from December 1998 to February 2008. Eighty-nine patients were approached with laparoscopy. Patients staged cT3/4 cTxN+ or uTxN+ were submitted to neoadjuvant treatment. Postoperative complications and oncological outcomes were registered.
We recovered tumour samples from 92 of the 143 patients operated on for colorectal cancer in our institution between 1995 and 2000. Five MSI markers (BAT 25, BAT 26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250) were studied on them. The rate and clinicopathologic characteristics of MSI tumours were investigated along with their impact on the global and disease-free survival as compared with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours.
This was a longitudinal, prospective study of 304 patients from a single centre in Catalonia, Spain. Patients underwent 1 of 3 treatment procedures: radical prostatectomy (114 patients), external beam radiation (134) or interstitial brachytherapy (56). HRQOL was assessed by both general and specific questionnaires, including the SF-36 health survey and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Interviews were administered prior to treatment and at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24. One-way analysis of variance and generalised estimating equations models were constructed to assess between group differences in HRQOL.
We reviewed records from all patients diagnosed with conventional high-grade osteosarcoma at our institution over a 25-year period and analysed the prognostic significance of LDH in high-grade localised extremity osteosarcomas treated with chemotherapy.
Event-related functional magnetic resonance with a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to explore brain activity during two overt oral language tasks, i.e., object naming (ON) and generation of action-verbs (GenA), in 14 non-demented PD patients using a common set of object drawings. The objects used were either man-made objects (MMO) or manipulable biological objects (MBO). Stimuli and tasks were randomized across subjects. Neuroimaging data were analyzed using SPM2.
Stepped hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamps were performed on 20 subjects with Type 2 diabetes, 10 SU-treated and 10 treated with twice-daily premixed insulin, and 10 age- and weight-matched non-diabetic controls. Diabetic subjects were matched for diabetes duration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and hypoglycaemia experience. We measured symptoms, counterregulatory hormones and cognitive function at glucose plateaux of 5, 4, 3.5, 3 and 2.5 mmol/l.
Analysis of the seasonality in diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes was based on the incidence data in 0- to 14-year-old children collected by the World Health Organization Diabetes Mondiale (WHO DiaMond) Project over the period 1990-1999. One hundred and five centres from 53 countries worldwide provided enough data for the seasonality analysis. The incidence seasonality patterns were also determined for age- and sex-specific groups.
This was a cross-sectional study in a nationally representative sample of 6739 people aged 52-79 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) 2004/2005. Diabetes cases were ascertained by self-reported doctor diagnosis of diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose measurement after a minimum of 8-h fast was available for 2387 (38% of the participants without diabetes). Undiagnosed diabetes cases were based on a fasting plasma glucose &gt;or= 7.0 mmol/l.
In 51 diabetic patients, CAN, symptoms and signs of DPN, vibration perception threshold (VPT), cold (CTT) and warm thermal perception thresholds (WTT) were measured. Neuropad response was determined as normal (complete colour change) or abnormal (absent or incomplete colour change). The time until the complete colour change (CCC time) was recorded.
The JADE interactive risk engine stratifies patients into different risk levels using results from an annual comprehensive assessment of complications and risk factors. We used a prospective registry consisting of 7534 Type 2 diabetic patients [45.6% men, median (range) age 57 years (13-92)] to perform internal validation of the risk engine.
A qualitative study using focus group methodology was conducted. Sampling of patients followed the maximum variation strategy. Sample size was determined by saturation. The focus group discussions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The meaning condensation procedure was used for data analysis. The resulting meaningful concepts were linked to ICF categories according to established linking rules.
Exposure to anti-IFRx was compared between T2DM patients with a history of weight loss (n = 100) and those with no weight loss or with weight gain (n = 102) during a 1-year follow-up period. Logistic regression was used to develop odds ratios for weight loss status.
Three patient groups totalling 28 subjects with diabetes [group A 10 Type 1 (Ulm), group B 10 Type 1 (Neuss), group C eight Type 2 (Aarhus)] participated in this trial. Two CRT microdialysis probes were inserted in parallel in the abdominal subcutaneous tissue for 120 h in each subject. In subjects in group A, glucose excursions were induced on one study day and those in group B underwent a glucose clamp (eu-, hypo- or hyperglycaemic) on one study day. CRT data were calibrated once with a retrospective calibration model based on a run-in time of 24 h and three blood glucose measurements per day.
In this 52-week randomized, multi-centre, open-label study, 295 subjects managed with diet and exercise and/or oral glucose-lowering medications received either exenatide QW or BID during weeks 1-30; thereafter, subjects receiving exenatide BID were switched to exenatide QW, with 258 total subjects receiving exenatide QW during weeks 30-52. Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire-status (DTSQ-s) and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) were assessed at baseline and weeks 30 and 52. Mean group changes from baseline to week 30 were estimated by ancova; changes from week 30 to week 52 were assessed by Student's t-test.
We studied 366 in-patients with insulin-treated diabetes at a single UK centre. We developed a 19-item DTSQ-IP to assess in-patient diabetes treatment satisfaction, and collected data on in-patient length of stay (LOS) and in-patient care at the same time.
We measured apoC-II and apoC-III in total plasma and in non-high-density lipoprotein fractions by an immunoturbidimetric assay in 88 Caucasian Type 2 diabetic patients and in 138 healthy control subjects.
We used a structured questionnaire to ask fifty healthcare professionals how 'dangerous' a given blood glucose value was. Their answers were modelled to produce an algorithm of assessed risk. To examine if patients (and their carers) would apportion a similar level of risk to that of healthcare professionals, the same questionnaire was issued to fifty children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. For patients under 8 years old the carers completed the questionnaires (n = 23). Both patient and carers together completed the questionnaire for those aged 8-11 years (n = 15) and patients over the age of 11 years completed the questionnaire themselves (n = 12). The median results and interquartile range of the assessed level of risk, as determined by the two groups, were compared using a generalized linear model.
The ionic liquids were oxidized in dilute aqueous solution in the presence of two different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. All reactions were performed in the dark to prevent photoreduction of Fe(III). The concentrations of ionic liquids during the process were monitored with high-performance liquid chromatography. Preliminary degradation pathways were studied with the aid of (1)H NMR.
The alga Chlorella vulgaris was maintained in the algal growth medium HB IV. The inhibition of algal growth was determined by measuring optical density at 680 nm (OD(680)). Initially, DM and two selected breakdown products were added to the algal cultures, and following degradation experiments analyses were carried out by high performance liquid chromatography. In addition, the possible relationship between DM degradation and toxicity was assessed, based on physico-chemical properties of the compounds and their toxicity.
Two vineyard soils with different properties were chosen as experimental samples. They were sampled from 0 to 10 cm, dried, and sieved to 2 mm. Each soil was spiked with copper sulfate solution to obtain the following total soil Cu concentrations: 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,600 mg.kg(-1). The treated soils were incubated for 2 weeks and then dried at 20 degrees C. For each soil sample and at each soil Cu concentration, the adsorption of lambda-CHT and CPM was measured using a batch equilibrium method. The concentration of lambda-CHT was determined by HPLC, and the amount of lambda-CHT and CPM adsorbed by the soil sample at equilibrium was determined by the difference between the initial and equilibrium concentrations in solution corrected by the blank adsorption measurement.
Powdered samples of two different color-type patinas (ochre-orange and brownish) were collected in the external and internal parts of the stained glass windows of the Prebystery and Chapter House of the Pedralbes Monastery by using a precision (odontological) drill. These patinas were subsequently analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
Test systems used in basic research to elucidate the olfactory cascade and the communication of environmental organisms by infochemicals are plentiful. Some of them might be the basis for a quantified ecotoxicological analysis of the infochemical effect. In principle, test systems for the infochemical effect could be developed at each step of the chemosensory signal transduction and processing cascade.
Common laboratory strain of E. coli (K12) was used and the effects of two emitted wavelengths (269 and 276 nm) were investigated with two photolytic batch reactors both including ten LEDs. The effects of test medium were examined with ultrapure water, nutrient and water, and nutrient and water with humic acids.
Effluents of 20 different industrial units were characterized by 24 attributes. Comparing these with corresponding irrigation water quality standards, the probability of their reuse was interpreted in the first approach. On the basis of relevant properties of major soil types dominated in a particular region, the soil-based usability of effluent was worked out in the second approach. By emphasizing the limitation of groundwater development where it went beyond 50% exploitation level, the land form and major soil type were then identified by applying a soil-based effluent reuse approach; the area-specific suitability of its use was perceived in the third approach.
The following parameters were determined in relation with Staroe lake: (1) the current quality of the lake's water-each 1,000-ml sample was collected at a surface point and a deep point (near the bottom layer), and the collected samples were directly analyzed after filtration; (2) atmospheric bulk deposition-bulk deposition was collected using a set of three rainwater samplers near the lake. In addition, bulk deposition was collected in a background site (250 km to the southwest of the smelter complex) as a reference; and (3) sediment profile (plus principal component analysis)-lake-bottom sediment was collected by an open-gravimetric column sampler equipped with an automatic diaphragm. After collection, the sample columns were cut at a 1-cm interval for analysis. Eigenvalues and variances by factor were calculated from the correlation coefficients.
Trichiurus lepturus (Actinopterygii: Perciformes) is a pscivorous marine straggler. Fish from this species (n = 104) were captured in a trapping barrier used by the local traditional population and using an otter trawl net along the main channel of the low estuary during two dry seasons (D1 = November, December 2005, January 2006; D2 = November, December 2006, January 2007) and the end of a rainy season (R = August, September, October 2006). Fish muscle samples were preserved cold and then freeze-dried prior to analysis of its total mercury (Hg-T) contents. Total mercury was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) with sodium borohydride as a reducing agent.
Surface sediment samples (146 in total) were collected at various points along the Swedish coast and offshore areas. In addition, bulk deposition was sampled, monthly, at a single site in northern Sweden during 1 year. The concentrations of tetra- through octa-substituted CDD/Fs were determined in both matrices.
Rapid ecological assessment based on a SPOT 5 image and field survey was used to simulate the vegetation of the whole area based on reference ecological factors of the GIS system. The vegetation map of the site was thus derived from this simulation. Based on the previous studies, the three vegetation types were identified as the suitable habitat of the monkeys. The confusion matrix-based field GPS points were applied to analyze the precision of the habitat map. Based on the map of suitable habitat of the monkeys, the utilization of the habitat and the carrying capacity were analyzed in the GIS.
Many independent experiments were performed on the individual processes in gene flow. The results comprise information both from laboratory, growth chambers and field trials, and they were generated using molecular or phenotypic markers and analysis of fitness parameters. Monitoring of the extent of spontaneous introgression in natural populations was also performed. Modelling was used as an additional tool to identify key parameters in gene flow.

The manuscript is supported by more than 70 professors and university academics of leading institutions in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and other countries in Europe, but addresses topics of global concern.
In this open-label phase II study, patients were randomised to receive morning or evening dosing of sunitinib 37.5mg/day. The primary end-point was clinical benefit rate (CBR; percent complete responses+partial responses [PRs]+stable disease [SD] 24 weeks). Secondary end-points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma biomarker levels.
A 31-item LENT-SOMA patient questionnaire was administered prospectively to 220 patients pre-treatment and at eight time periods post-radical head and neck radiotherapy over 3 years. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out and questionnaire reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.
Sixty-six patients (median age, 13.4 years) with newly diagnosed, localised disease completed three HRQOL instruments, and their parents completed two of the same instruments at diagnosis, before surgery (Week 12), at Week 23 and a median of 20 weeks after treatment completion.
The effect of R(+)XK469 on S-warfarin hydroxylation was determined by the measurement of S-7-hydroxywarfarin formation in pooled human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYP2C9.
We performed a review of the data on the prognostic and/or predictive value of molecular markers for cytotoxic drugs in CRC. The following markers were included: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, thymidine phosphorylase, thymidylate synthase, mismatch repair deficiency, topoisomerase 1, excision cross-complementing gene and carboxylesterases.
Twenty-five patients with subacute or chronic stroke were included in the study. At the beginning, all the patients received a conventional rehabilitation programme for 3 weeks. Seventeen patients who had no improvement in upper extremity functioning with this conventional programme received CIMT for 3 weeks. Active range of motion (ROM) and modified Ashworth scale of the plegic upper extremity were noted; Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and KFET were performed to each patient before and after CIMT.
Several electronic databases were searched up to January 2007. The review considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised studies of children aged 3 to 16 years with acquired dysarthria grouped by aetiology (e.g., brain tumour, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular accident). Both authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts for relevance (100% inter-rater reliability) and the full text version of all potentially relevant articles was obtained. No studies met inclusion criteria.
Motor function and QoL of 16 (9 males and 7 females) consecutive stroke survivors (60.68+/-9.78 years) recruited from a Nigerian tertiary health facility in Ibadan were assessed within four weeks of stroke onset (baseline) and monthly for five consecutive months using the Modified Motor Assessment Scale (MMAS) and World Health Organization's WHOQoL BREF questionnaire respectively. Friedman's ANOVA was used to study the pattern of each construct across the study period, while relationship between the MMAS and WHOQoLBREF at the first and sixth month post-stroke was computed using Spearman's correlation coefficient at 0.05 alpha.
Twenty chronic hemiparetic stroke patients presenting with a stiff-knee gait performed an instrumented gait analysis at the same walking speed before and 2 months after BoNT-A injection in several spastic muscles. We used the kinematic recordings previously obtained by Caty et al. [Caty GD, Detrembleur C, Bleyenheuft C, Deltombe T, Lejeune TM. Effect of simultaneous botulinum toxin injections into several muscles on impairment, activity, participation, and quality of life among stroke patients presenting with a stiff knee gait. Stroke 2008;39(October (10)):2803-8] and computed KSC following Borghese's methodology. The treatment effect was tested using a repeated measures ANOVA.
Individuals with PN and age-matched controls were assessed for functional gait by the 6-min walk and timed up-and-go tests. Leg strength was measured as isokinetic peak torque of the knee extensors. Standing balance was assessed by center-of-pressure sway velocity and area during quiet stance. Locomotor kinematics from treadmill walking were used to compute stride duration variability and local instability (i.e., finite-time Lyapunov exponents), which estimate kinematic divergence caused by small-scale perturbations.
A total of 28 subjects were recruited for the study of which 14 were clinically diagnosed with hallux valgus. A custom built platform was used to collect peak pressure and shear data. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the recorded data.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone were used to evaluate clinical effectiveness and safety. Inclusion criteria included any comparator trial for duration of treatment studies, and any study design conducted in patients with NSTE-ACS, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stroke, peripheral artery disease (PAD) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) for evidence of rebound on withdrawal of treatment. The existing model was updated to provide a more robust approach to evaluating the cost-effectiveness of alternative durations of clopidogrel and to assess the potential value of further research using value of information approaches.
Gelatin zymography was performed on 157 tissue extracts of malignant and adjacent normal breast tissues as well as negative and positive lymph nodes from 49 breast cancer patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS statistical software (version 10).
This study is designed with 130 study subjects for analysis of selected types of HPV 6/11 and 16/18, in four groups, in a course of three years. The Bethesda system of classification is followed for grouping the samples, using histopathologic examination in biopsies.
The biopsy samples were collected in 10% buffered formalin and were embedded in paraffin within 24 hours, for long-term preservation. The presence of HPV types were tested by PCR using type-specific primers for HPV16 and HPV18 in the DNA isolated from the subject's biopsies. The stages of cervical lesions were identified by histopathology using the Hematoxylin Eosin stain.
The data were subjected to statistical analysis, using the SPSS and INSTAT software packages for their associations and risk estimation, respectively. The Graph Pad Prism 2 x 2 contingency table was used for risk estimation and the Kruskel Wallis test was used for analysis of the associations.
The descriptive survey was conducted to determine the practices of nurses and midwives and their attitude toward BSE. It tried to cover the total population rather than sampling part of it. However, 15 nurses and midwives, where there were errors detected in their data coding papers, and who did not accept to join the study, were excluded from the study. A total of 80 nurses and midwives were included in the study group.
This survey was carried out at the State Hospital, all Public Health Cabins, and Family Health Centers, in the rural area of Izmir, a city located in the western region of Turkey. The data was collected between 15 March and 1 April 2004.

Age, marriage, parity, menopausal status, smoking, oral contraceptive usage, pathological staging, and histological grading were reviewed by a trained general practitioner. SPSS 14 was used for statistical analysis.
This study assessed 13 gnathic OS patients of 98 OS patients from four major referral centers during 1996-2007. The age distribution, gender, involved site, clinical findings, signs, symptoms, grade and sub-types were assessed. Hematoxylin-eosin, Picrosirius red, Ponceau trichrome, Masson trichrome and osteoid staining methods were used.
We analyzed noninfectious, noninflammatory, benign lesions of the calcaneum seen in the Orthopedic Out Patient Department from 1991 to 2003. Twelve such tumors were encountered. There were 11 males and one female and their ages varied from 18 to 53 years with a median of 31. Data was collected from the histopathology reports, radiographs, and inpatient and outpatient records. One of the coauthors reviewed the histopathologic findings of all the tumors.
In a retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series, the records of 39 eyes of 31 patients presenting with Stage 4 retinal detachment secondary to ROP who underwent primary two or three-port lens-sparing vitrectomy from January 2000 to October 2006 were evaluated. The outcomes studied at the final follow-up visit were the retinal status, lens and medial clarity and visual acuity . Favorable anatomical outcome was defined as the retinal reattachment of the posterior pole at two months after the surgery; and favorable functional outcome was defined as a central, steady and maintained fixation, with the child following light.
Retrospective analysis of a non-comparative series from the database was done. All the patients presenting with corneal stromal infiltrate underwent standard microbiologic evaluation of their corneal scrapings, and smear and culture-guided antimicrobial therapy.
This prospective observational study included patients with manifest, horizontal, comitant deviation&gt; 10 prism diopter (PD). Inter-eye acuity difference (IEAD) was calculated by converting Snellen visual acuity to logMAR and was compared with BFP testing. The fixation behavior of the non-preferred eye was evaluated by a single investigator as central or uncentral, steady or unsteady and maintained or unmaintained. Amblyopia was defined as the IEAD of&gt; 0.2 logMAR.

Ophthalmologists assessed vision, ocular pressure, ocular media and posterior segment to note ocular manifestations among patients with DM. DR was graded by using bio-microscope and Volk lens. The prevalence and 95% confidence interval of ocular complications of DM were calculated. Risk factors of DR like age, sex, duration of diabetes and hypertension were evaluated.
Univariate and multivariate analysis.
The 30-cluster sampling technique based on probability proportional to size advocated by the World Health Organization was used to assess vitamin A-first dose supplement amongst 210 children in the age group of 12-23 months residing in slums of a randomly selected municipal zone of Delhi during October to November 2005.
Twenty-six ovarian cancer specimens were obtained during ovarian cancer debulking, and tumor slices were prepared with the Krumdieck tissue slicer. The tumor slices were exposed to varying concentrations of TRA-8, carboplatin/paclitaxel, or the combination of TRA-8 and chemotherapy. Using nonlinear modeling, dose-response curves and IC50 values were generated for specimens treated with TRA-8. The additive and synergistic cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy combination with TRA-8 were evaluated in specimens. In addition to adenosine triphosphate viability assays, the treated and untreated slices were assessed by immunohistochemistry to confirm apoptosis induction.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 101 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer were used for immunohistochemical staining for the ERCC1 protein. All patients received carboplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy.
A retrospective case series of 45 consecutive patients who underwent prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy between 2004 and March 2008.
Eligible patients were those with epithelial ovarian carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma stages II to IV who underwent initial surgery and had a residual tumor size of 2 cm or larger. Patients received IV paclitaxel 175 mg/m followed by intraperitoneal carboplatin AUC6. The primary end point was a response. Secondary end points were toxicity, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

Clinical data included patients' age, comorbidities, chronic use of medications, body mass index (kg/m), previous surgical procedures, surgical International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, histological grade, relevant prognostic factors, a number of dissected lymph nodes, occurrence of perioperative complications, postoperative hospital stay (in days), and long-term disease-specific survival (in months).
A total of 191 patients with endometrial cancer, who underwent hysterectomy from 1995 to 2007 in Tottori University Hospital, were included in this study. One hundred seventy-four patients underwent endometrial curettage or Pipelle biopsy preoperatively. Histological grade was compared between preoperation and postoperation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before surgery, and the depth of MI was assessed as 3 levels (no MI, &lt;50%, and &gt;50%). During surgery, the uterine wall was incised at the most invasive part, and then, intraoperative gross assessment was evaluated as less than or greater than 50%.
Full-length HIF-1alpha (fL HIF-1alpha) and dominant-negative HIF-1alpha (dn HIF-1alpha) were transfected into UCC SiHa cells. The expression of HIF-1alpha and its targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), and human growth and transformation-dependent protein (HGTD-P) was detected by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were surveyed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling staining, and scratching test.
This was a retrospective study of patients with locoregionally advanced cervical cancer staged by examination under anesthesia and pretreatment MRI and PET. Potential prognostic factors examined were derived from either clinical evaluation (age, FIGO stage, clinical diameter, histology), MRI (corpus invasion, tumor volume), or PET (lymph node metastasis). Outcome measures examined were overall survival, relapse-free survival, time to failure, local failure, nodal failure, and distant failure.
The infections of HPV in a total of 175 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, including 71 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 27 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and 77 CC were detected by the combination of consensus primers nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and type-specific primers nested PCR.
This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial evaluating the toxicity and efficacy of oral erlotinib at an initial dosage of 150 mg daily until progressive disease or adverse effects prohibited further therapy.
Data files of 2 international screening trials, the NIS (n = 3187) and the LAMS (n = 12,114) study cohorts, were combined, and a subcohort of 1865 (n = 854 and n = 1011 for the NIS and the LAMS, respectively) women prospectively followed up for 19.7 (median, 22.2) months was analyzed for different intermediate end-point markers of disease progression to squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 and higher (CIN1+), and CIN grade 2 and higher (CIN2+) as terminal events.
Forty-three consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2 to IIB uterine cervical cancer were treated with intravenous paclitaxel (60 mg/m), followed by intravenous cisplatin (60 mg/m) every 10 days. Two weeks after the third cycle of chemotherapy, the patients underwent surgery or radiation therapy, depending on overall condition. They were followed up, and 5-year survival rates and factors affecting prognosis were evaluated.
Bone marrow aspirates from 377 patients with primary ovarian (112), endometrial (141), cervical (102), and vulvar cancer (22) undergoing surgery at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany between November 2001 and November 2007, were included into the study. Disseminated tumor cells were identified by immunocytochemistry using the pancytokeratin antibody A45B/B3 and by cytomorphology.
Patients with cervical cancer who underwent RH have been enrolled in a questionnaire-based study. Quality of life (QoL) and bladder, intestinal, and sexual dysfunctions were evaluated with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix (FACT-Cx). Patients were grouped according to the type of RH: group 1, class II RH and group 2, class III nerve-sparing RH (NSRH).
A retrospective study was conducted on LRH + LPL in 117 cases of cervical cancer with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages Ib (n = 96) and II a (n = 21) from August 1998 to December 2006. The intraoperative and postoperative complications were analyzed.
Three hundred five patients who needed an MPE were analyzed from 9 French cancer centers. One hundred sixty-eight MPEs were performed during initial surgery (55.1%), 69 during interval surgery (22.6%), 36 after chemotherapy (11.8%), and 32 for recurrences (10.5%).
To evaluate the current patterns of care, a questionnaire with 48 items was sent to 40 Society of Gynecologic Oncologists member clinics with fellowship programs and all 38 German teaching hospitals for gynecologic oncology.
Our database was searched for all women who had a laparotomy for advanced stage (stages III and IV) ovarian cancer between January 2001 and December 2007. Women who had the word(s) "ureteric," "ureter," "stent," "stents," and "stented" either in their operation notes or the multidisciplinary meeting discussions were filtered to identify those who had a ureteric stent inserted. Stents inserted because of excision/injury to ureters with reanastomosis or reinsertion to bladder were excluded.
We designed and built a non-invasive, computerized system that automatically initiates VNS following the real-time detection of a pre-identified seizure or epileptiform discharge. The system detects these events through patient-specific analysis of the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.
Nine men completed 3 trials in a randomized counterbalanced order, with trials separated by at least 7 days. Two hours before the run after an overnight fast, each participant consumed a high-GI (GI = 83) or low-GI (GI = 36) CHO meal or low-energy sugar-free Jell-O (GI = 0, control). The 2 isocaloric GI meals provided 1.5 g available CHO/kg body mass. During each trial, 2 ml/kg body mass of a 6.6% CHO-electrolyte solution was provided immediately before exercise and every 2.5 km after the start of running. Each trial consisted of a 21-km performance run on a level treadmill. The participants were required to run at 70% VO2max during the first 5 km of the run. They then completed the remaining 16 km as fast as possible.
TAS, protein, and enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically before and after 2 and 3 hr of exercise without or with L-cys administration.
This study examined 73 bifurcation lesions with post-procedural and 9-month follow-up intravascular ultrasound images for both main vessel (MV) and SB. All lesions were treated with drug-eluting stents using the T-stenting technique. Analysis included 5 distinct locations: MV proximal stent, MV middle area, MV distal stent, SB ostium (&lt;5 mm distal to the neocarina), and SB distal stent.
Rates of the primary composite end point (major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events) to 1 year and mortality to a median of 4.4 years in 427 patients included in the 3 randomized arms of the REACT trial (repeat lysis, conservative therapy, and R-PCI) were analyzed.
We studied 36 patients with primary AMI. Peripheral blood sampling was performed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 days after AMI onset. Two monocyte subsets (CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+)) were measured by flow cytometry. The extent of myocardial salvage 7 days after AMI was evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging as the difference between myocardium at risk (T2-weighted hyperintense lesion) and myocardial necrosis (delayed gadolinium enhancement). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was also performed 6 months after AMI.
We analyzed ECG recordings with TdP from 35 LQTS patients (15 c-LQTS and 20 a-LQTS) and compared them with premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) from 40 patients with normal QT intervals and with PVCs in 24 of the 35 LQTS patients not related to TdP.
Perfusion and CFR were assessed in 256 patients using (13)N-ammonia PET, and follow-up was obtained in 245 (96%) patients. Sixteen early revascularized patients were excluded and 229 were assigned to normal versus abnormal perfusion or normal versus abnormal CFR (&lt;2.0). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, late revascularization, or hospitalization for cardiac reasons) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to identify independent predictors for cardiac events.
There were 488 patients transplanted for CHD from the combined Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (1993 to 2002, n = 367) and the Cardiac Transplant Registry Database (1990 to 2002, n = 121) who were analyzed.
Detailed electroanatomic mapping of the LV endocardium was performed in 17 stable control ICM patients (16 males) without clinical SMVT. They were compared with 17 ICM patients (15 males) with spontaneous SMVT. Standard definitions of low-voltage zones and fractionated, isolated, and very late potentials were used.
In the current study, we tested the effect of treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent, apigenin in combination with DNA vaccines encoding the HPV-16 E7 antigen linked to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the control of the E7-expressing tumor, TC-1.
To reveal whether chromosome fidelity was decreased, the frequency of gynandromorphy, an individual with both male and female characteristics, and of non-disjunction were measured in the progeny from parents with reduced mars and/or tlk activities and analyzed by Student's t-test. To show that the genetic interaction between mars and tlk is epistatic or parallel, a cytological analysis of embryos with either reduced or increased activities of mars and/or tlk was used to reveal defects in mitotic-spindle morphology and chromosome segregation.
We screened all 2,462 completed Cochrane reviews published since 2000 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 3, 2006. In a random sample (n=61) of 292 reviews, including unpublished trials, we studied all 116 references.
We used all 105 randomized controlled trials in the Cochrane review of NRT for smoking cessation. We obtained impact factors from the Journal Citation Reports and the number of citations from ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar.
Simulations were used to estimate the error rates.
We identified 17 low back pain prognosis reviews published between 2000 and 2006. One reviewer extracted and a second checked review characteristics and results. Two reviewers independently assessed review quality.
We performed multiple-treatments meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework by synthesizing six Cochrane reviews. We explored the compatibility between direct and indirect evidence and adjusted the results using a meta-regression model to take into account differences in the year of randomization across studies.
We constructed an item bank consisting of 33 activities commonly affected by lower extremity (LE) osteoarthritis. A sample of 323 adults with LE osteoarthritis reported their degree of limitation in performing everyday activities, and completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II). We used confirmatory factor analyses to assess scale unidimensionality and IRT methods to calibrate the items and examine the fit of the data. Using CAT simulation analyses, we examined the performance of OA-DISABILITY-CATs of different lengths compared with the full-item bank and the HAQ-II.
NNT(t) reflects the point at which the risks and costs of a clinical intervention balance the benefit. MERT defines the minimum target event risk at which the intervention is justified. Uncertainty in these measures has not previously been investigated.
Backward multivariable logistic regression (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.157) was performed with possible predictors for persistent complaints in patients with nonspecific neck pain. The continuous variables were introduced in the analysis in three separate ways: (1) continuous, (2) split into multiple categories, and (3) dichotomized. The different models were compared with regard to model content, goodness of fit, explained variation, and discriminative ability. We also compared the effect on performance of categorization before and after the selection procedure.
Over three school years, 555 randomly selected fourth-grade children were interviewed to obtain a 24-hour dietary recall; before being interviewed, 374 children were observed eating two school meals (breakfast, lunch), and 181 children were not observed. Within observation-status groups (observed, unobserved), children were randomized within sex to one of six combinations from two target periods (prior 24 hours, previous day) crossed with three interview times (morning, afternoon, evening).
We encountered a meta-analysis in which a confidence interval (CI) of relative risk (RR) overlapped 1.0; the point estimate favored treatment A, but when we used RR and median baseline risk to calculate a CI for RD, a greater portion of the CI favored treatment B (a result that some may find counterintuitive). We then calculated 10 different RDs from recently published meta-analyses in outcomes in which CIs of RR crossed 1.0 using three methods: estimation from RR, estimation from the odds ratio, and pooling RDs across trials.
Review of methodological articles.
The number of authors listed per original research article published in the five general medical journals with the greatest 2004 Impact Factors in the first issue of each month in the years before and after introduction of required author contribution forms was compared.
Factor analysis of the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality-of-Life (ADDQoL) items (n=385) identified plausible attributes. An expert panel provided qualitative input, including additional items. Data from three pilot rounds on patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were analyzed using Rasch analysis (RA). In a validation survey, the final version of the CS was mailed along with the SF-12v2, Well-Being Questionnaire, and Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form to a convenience sample (type 1 or type 2 diabetes).
One hundred ninety-nine consecutive adults presenting to a tertiary mood disorders clinic with major depressive disorder with either atypical or melancholic features according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders were administered a self-report adult attachment questionnaire to assess the core dimensions of secure, anxious-ambivalent, and avoidant attachment. Attachment scores were compared across the 2 depressed groups defined by atypical and melancholic features using multivariate analysis of variance. The study was conducted between 1999 and 2004.
Two randomized trials were conducted to assess the benefits of adjunctive acupuncture for symptoms of depression and hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder (DSM-IV criteria). For 20 patients experiencing symptoms of hypomania, targeted acupuncture (points specific to symptoms) was compared to acupuncture points off the acupuncture meridian over 12 weeks (from May 2000 through May 2003). For patients experiencing symptoms of depression (n = 26), targeted acupuncture was compared to acupuncture for nonpsychiatric health concerns over 8 weeks (from November 2001 through May 2003). Preexisting psychotropic medications were maintained at stable doses throughout study participation.
We examined 95 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) in a long-stage unit and 53 healthy controls (matched for age, gender, and years of education). Neuropsychological battery included tests for verbal memory, working memory, executive functioning, and processing speed. Functional disability was assessed at 6-month follow-up with the Disability Assessment Schedule after the neuropsychological and clinical assessment. The study was conducted from September 2005 to July 2008.
Sex- and age-matched patients with anxiety disorders (N = 33) and healthy volunteers (N = 33) were assessed on standardized and validated measures of subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and subclinical narcoleptic events in the form of cataplexy (Stanford Center for Narcolepsy Revised Sleep Inventory). Patients were recruited from October 2006 to January 2007 from 2 programs of the Penn State Behavioral Health Clinic.
Subjects (N = 46) who responded to selective SRIs (SSRIs) in an initial 12-week trial were continued on SSRI monotherapy plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for 1 year. Subjects (N = 44) who failed to respond to SSRIs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 atypical antipsychotics -- olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone -- and were consecutively treated using SSRI + atypical antipsychotics combined with CBT for 1 year. This study was conducted from January 2006 to November 2007 at Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine Hospital, Japan.
Records of antipsychotic prescriptions for all U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs patients diagnosed with MDD (ICD-9 criteria), excluding those with comorbid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, in the fiscal year 2007 (N = 191,522) were examined. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to identify veterans' characteristics, measures of service use, and medical center characteristics that were associated with receipt of these medications and, among such users, with use of the lower doses suggested for MDD.
The search for the psychiatric clinical manifestations of fragile X-associated conditions was accomplished by PubMed for clinical papers published between 1970 and 2008 with the following search terms: Fragile X syndrome, depression, psychosis, anxiety, and dementia.
Articles addressing psychiatric symptoms in premutation carriers based on review of the abstracts were reviewed. As the majority of the literature on this topic is based on case reports and small case series, these were included in the database.
This was a retrospective analysis of data from the 36-week Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness in Alzheimer's Disease in which patients with probable AD (diagnosed according to criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS/ADRDA]) were treated in a naturalistic manner. Scores were compared on the irritability, apathy, delusions, and hallucinations subscales of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. The trial was conducted between April 2001 and November 2004.
Patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with a fixed dose of lurasidone 80 mg (N = 90, 75.6% male, mean age = 39.7 years, mean baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [BPRSd] = 55.1) or placebo (N = 90, 77.8% male, mean age = 41.9 years, mean BPRSd score = 56.1). The primary efficacy measure was the BPRSd. The study was conducted from May to December 2004.
The DEMO trial is a randomized pragmatic trial for patients with unipolar depression conducted from January 2005 through July 2007. Patients were referred from general practitioners or psychiatrists and were eligible if they fulfilled the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, criteria for unipolar depression and were aged between 18 and 55 years. Patients (N = 165) were allocated to supervised strength, aerobic, or relaxation training during a 4-month period. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)), the secondary outcome measure was the percentage of days absent from work during the last 10 working days, and the tertiary outcome measure was effect on cognitive abilities.
This inpatient randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ziprasidone-controlled, 28-day study of the efficacy of iloperidone was conducted from November 2005 to September 2006. Likelihood ratios, predicted probabilities of response, and number needed to treat were calculated for patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) using 6 genetic markers of iloperidone response as measured by change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Total (PANSS-T) score. Data analysis was performed on 409 patients of various ethnic origins.
In a prospective cohort study, 204 consecutive HCV outpatients who received PegIFN and RBV were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R). Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered at baseline and at 4, 12, 24, and/or 48 weeks of treatment. Patients were recruited between September 2003 and December 2006.
Six hundred seventy-five Israeli veterans from the 1982 Lebanon War were assessed. The clinical group consisted of 369 who had combat stress reaction (CSR) during the war, and the nonclinical group consisted of 306 veterans with no antecedent CSR. The 2 groups were matched in age, education, military rank, and assignment. They were prospectively evaluated 1, 2, and 20 years after the war.
Subjects completing a 21-day placebo-controlled trial of ziprasidone in DSM-IV acute bipolar mania (N = 65) were enrolled in a 52-week open-label extension of flexibly dosed ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day, administered b.i.d. Three subjects had missing evaluations (N = 62) but still provided demographic data. Subpopulations with manic (N = 43) or mixed (N = 19) episodes, and with (N = 37) or without (N = 25) psychotic symptoms, were identified. Safety evaluations included adverse event monitoring, electrocardiography, and standard laboratory assessments. Efficacy measures included change from initial study baseline in Mania Rating Scale (MRS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) scores, as well as MRS responder rates (&gt; or = 50% reduction from initial study baseline). The study was conducted from March 1998 to September 1999.
An ecological, retrospective time-series analysis and a meta-analysis of the suicide deaths in 3 Asian regions: Hong Kong (from 2001 to 2003), Taiwan, and South Korea (both from 2003 to 2005).
A total of 71 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (Mini-Mental State Examination score &gt; or = 21 and &lt; or = 26) were successfully randomly assigned to placebo (N = 38) or lithium treatment (N = 33) at 6 academic expert memory clinics. The 10-week treatment included a 6-week titration phase to reach the target serum level of lithium (0.5-0.8 mmol/L). The primary outcome measures were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and GSK-3 activity in lymphocytes. Secondary outcome measures were CSF concentration of total tau and beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)), plasma levels of Abeta(1-42), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS)-Cognitive summary scores, MMSE, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Patients were enrolled in the study from November 2004 to July 2005.
Healthy subjects with pre-existing recession were assigned to brush with either a PT (n=55) or an ADA reference MT (n=54) according to a prospective randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel group design. Participants were asked to brush their teeth twice daily for two minutes each with the same fluoride toothpaste. Clinical attachment loss and probing pocket depths (PPDs) were measured at six sites per tooth to the nearest mm by one calibrated examiner at baseline and after six months. Gingival recession was calculated as the differences between clinical attachment loss and PPDs overall and separately at individual sites.
Forty human third molar teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n=10). The occlusal enamel was removed to obtain a flat surface of dentin. Each group was treated as follows: Group 1: 10% polyacrylic acid (positive control); Group 2: 37% phosphoric acid followed by 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); Group 3: 1.1% APF gel; and Group 4: no conditioning (negative control). Fuji II LC glass ionomer was bonded to dentin using a cylindrical mold. Samples were thermocycled and debonded using a shear force with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey tests (a = 0.05).
Fifty enamel blocks were either roughened with 600-grit SiC paper or polished with diamond pastes. After establishing ten test groups (n=5), the initial Ra measurements, rough (R) and smooth (S) enamel surfaces were etched according to the following protocols: Group 1(R)/Group 2(S)- 35% phosphoric acid gel (H3PO4) for 15 seconds; Group 3(R)/Group 4(S)- 35% H3PO4 for 60 seconds; Group 5(R)/Group 6(S)- Clearfil SE Bond primer for 20 seconds; Group 7(R)/Group 8(S)- self-etching primer (SEP) for 60 seconds; Group 9(R)/Group 10(S)- 35% H3PO4 for 15 seconds + SEP for 20 seconds. After treatments, a new Ra measurement was performed and enamel surfaces were bonded with either Single Bond (Group 1 to Group 4) or Clearfil SE Bond (Group 5 to Group 10). Afterwards, specimens were prepared for the microtensile test. Ra values were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the BS values were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (5%). Correlation between BS and Ra values was assessed using the Pearson's test.
This study included 40 subjects with bilateral occlusal carious lesions on mandibular first permanent molars. The lesions were randomly assigned to receive one restoration after carious dentin removal with a polymer bur and the second after removal of carious dentin with a carbon steel round bur. Both procedures were completed by a single operator in one appointment. The efficacy of caries removal, time taken for caries removal, and patients' perception of the treatment were evaluated. The restorations were evaluated immediately and after six months using intraoral periapical radiographs (IOPA).
The study included 49 patients (28 women, 21 men) in need of implant treatment in the anterior teeth region of either the maxilla or mandible. Twenty-three subjects received 37 immediate (Im) implants and 26 subjects received 37 delayed (De) implants. The implants were placed immediately in the alveoli following the extraction in the Im group and the implants in the De group were placed approximately six months following the extractions. The width and depth of the marginal bone defects mesial and distal to the implants were evaluated radiographically using computer software designed to measure distances in digitized radiographs. The mean reduction of bone defect over time was 48% (from 3.4 to 1.3 mm) in the Im group which was statistically significant (P &lt;0.05) when tested using a sample t-test, while the mean reduction was 17% (from 2.1 to 1.9 mm) in the De group.
A total of 310 canals were evaluated in patients presenting for root canal therapy. Canals with intact apices were selected. After gaining straight line endodontic access, the coronal third was flared using Gates-Glidden drills. Working length was determined using an apex locator. ISO Standard K-files (tapered) were passively introduced into the canals starting with a No. 15 file. The first K-file size to bind against the canal walls without pushing and to reach the working length was recorded as the FKFB (First K File to Bind). Next, ISO Standard Lightspeed files (non-tapered instruments) starting with No. 20 were then gently introduced by hand to each canal in ascending order to the working length. The first size of a Lightspeed instrument to bind against the canal walls and reach the working length was recorded as FLSB (First Light Speed to Bind). In all instances a larger file was introduced to ensure it could not reach the same depth (i.e., working length). Statistical analysis was carried out using a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA).
This cross-sectional case-control study was conducted on 90 children (45 PLBW and 45 NBW). The demographic data and information about feeding practices was ascertained using a structured questionnaire. Dental caries status (dmft) was determined, and the differences between the two groups were tested using the Fisher's exact and the Mann-Whitney U tests at a confidence level of 5%.
The present study was conducted on 80 asthmatic patients receiving treatment at the KMC Hospital, Mangalore, India. They were examined for their caries status, and the scores were compared with an age, sex, and socioeconomic status matched group of 80 non-asthmatic patients as controls. The mean age of asthmatics was 17.4 (+/-4.3) years and mean duration of asthma was 17.69 (+/-7.66) months.
Ninety non-syndromic orthodontic patients from a south Indian population, with either labial or palatal impactions of one or both maxillary canine teeth, were selected for the study group. A group of 250 patients who had normally erupted maxillary canines were selected as controls. Clinical findings and panoramic radiographs were used to identify dental anomalies.
A cross-sectional study consisting of 1,013 mothers of children between the ages four to 36 months who visited the immunization clinics at the Community Health Centres in Ife Central and Ife East Local Government Areas. Data was analyzed using STATA (Intercooled release 9) for Windows.
A review of the initiatives undertaken by the dental profession to adopt smoking cessation recommendations as standard of care is presented.
A 42-year-old female patient presented with an endodontically treated mandibular right first molar with extensive destruction of the coronal tooth structure. To conserve the remaining tooth structure a FRC resin core substructure was fabricated and veneered with Ceramage dentin and enamel hybrid composite to create the final restoration.
We examined the expression of PDCD4 in three HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials, MHCC-97H (high metastatic potential), MHCC-97L (low metastatic potential) and Hep3B (no metastatic potential). A plasmid encoding PDCD4 gene was constructed and then transfected into HCC cells with the lowest PDCD4 expression level. Effects of PDCD4 on cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, gene expression of metastasis tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) and in vitro migration and invasion capacity were assessed after transfection.
mRNAs extracted from 35 pancreatic tubular adenocarcinoma tissues obtained by EUS-FNA before GEM-treatment were studied. mRNAs were amplified and applied to a Focused DNA Array, which was restricted to well-known genes, including GEM sensitivity-related genes, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), hENT2, dCMP deaminase, cytidine deaminase, 5'-nucleotidase, ribonucleotide reductase 1 (RRM1) and RRM2. mRNA levels were classified into high and low expression based on a cut-off value defined as the average expression of 35 samples. These 35 patients were divided into the following two groups. Patients with partial response and those with stable disease whose tumor markers decreased by 50% or more were classified as the effective group. The rest of patients were classified as the non-effective group. The relationship between GEM efficacy and mRNA expression was then examined by chi-squared test.
Retrospective survey regarding the views of a large sample of Iranian sued physicians by using a piloted anonymous questionnaire.
Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).
Eighty (n = 80) medical students, who had no experience with tying a laparoscopic intracorporeal knot, were randomly taught to do so by either reading a text with accompanying pictures (n = 40) or watching a short video with audio of comparable content (n = 40). The participants were allowed to review the material for as long as they needed to achieve understanding of the procedure. They were then asked to tie a laparoscopic square knot in a box trainer, with a limit time of 15 minutes. Time to review the educational material(s), time to tie the knot(s), numbers of attempts at the task (n), and numbers of those who expressed understanding of the task (n) were recorded.

La Conception Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Marseille, France.
Thirty-one women who had a term pregnancy from January 1996 through December 2004 after hysteroscopic metroplasty for septate uterus (group A) were studied retrospectively. A control group (group B) of 62 women was selected from the same database who had term pregnancies and no history of hysteroscopic metroplasty.
Cross-sectional study (Canadian Task Force II-2).
University teaching hospital.
Two hundred fifty-seven of 1000 randomly selected women aged 45 to 50 years.
Transvaginal ultrasonography and saline infusion sonography were performed in all study participants and were repeated in women with endometrial polyps after 12 months. Polyps present at follow-up were removed by hysteroscopic polyp resection.
Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-3).
Fertility and pelvic surgery clinics.
One hundred sixty-eight women (age 21-53 years) with symptoms including pelvic pain, infertility, or both with 252 bowel endometriotic lesions underwent laparoscopic bowel resection performed by gynecologic surgeons between May 2000 and January 2008.
Laparoscopic procedures for excision of several endometriotic nodes and lesions included shaving resection (LscShR), discoid resection (LscDR), segmental resection (LscSgR), terminal ileal resection (LscIR), partial cecal resection (LscCR), and appendectomy (LscAp).
Prospective observational case series (Canadian Task Force Classification II-3).
University affiliated teaching hospital.
Premenopausal women on Warfarin therapy.
From January 2002 through January 2007, 10 women were identified from the senior author's clinical practice (G.A.V.). After clinical assessment, including Papanicolaou smear, endometrial biopsy, and pelvic sonography, the LNG-IUS was placed to treat their AUB.
Case series.
Five consecutive collegiate Division I wrestlers, with a mean age of 20.2 years (range, 18-22 years), were treated postsurgical stabilization to address posterior glenohumeral joint instability. All received physical therapy postoperatively, consisting of range-ofmotion, strengthening, and plyometrics exercises, neuromuscular re-education, and sport-specific training. Functional outcome scores using the Penn Shoulder Score questionnaire were recorded at postsurgical initial evaluation and discharge. Isometric shoulder strength, measured with a handheld dynamometer at discharge, was compared with measurements made during preseason screening.

Controlled laboratory study.
Bilateral knee MCL injuries were created in 51 rodents, while 7 rodents were maintained as ligament-intact, control animals. IACFM was commenced 1 week following injury and introduced 3 sessions per week for 1 minute per session. IACFM was introduced unilaterally (IACFM-treated), with the contralateral, injured MCL serving as an internal control (nontreated). Thirty-one injured animals received 9 ACFM treatments, while the remaining 20 injured animals received 30 treatments. Ligament biomechanical properties and morphology were assessed at either 4 or 12 weeks postinjury.
Resident's case problem.
A 32-year-old male presented to a medical aid station in Iraq with a history of 4 weeks of insidious onset and recent worsening of low back, left buttock, and posterior left thigh pain. He denied symptoms distal to the knee, paresthesias, saddle anesthesia, or bowel and bladder function changes. At the initial examination, the patient was neurologically intact throughout all lumbosacral levels with negative straight-leg raises. He also presented with severely limited lumbar flexion active range of motion, and reduction of symptoms occurred with repeated lumbar extension. At the follow-up visit, 10 days later, he reported a new, sudden onset of saddle anesthesia, constipation, and urinary hesitancy, with physical exam findings of right plantar flexion weakness, absent right ankle reflex, and decreased anal sphincter tone. No advanced medical imaging capabilities were available locally. Due to suspected CES, the patient was medically evacuated to a neurosurgeon and within 48 hours underwent an emergent L4-5 laminectomy/decompression. He returned to full military duty 18 weeks after surgery without back or lower extremity symptoms or neurological deficit.

Experimental laboratory study.
Surface electromyography was used to quantify the activity level of the gluteal muscles in 21 healthy, physically active subjects while performing 12 exercises. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to compare normalized mean signal amplitude levels, expressed as a percent of a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), across exercises.
Randomized clinical trial.
Forty-one patients (21 females) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the experimental group received Kinesio Taping to the cervical spine (applied with tension) and the placebo group received a sham Kinesio Taping application (applied without tension). Both neck pain (11-point numerical pain rating scale) and cervical range-of-motion data were collected at baseline, immediately after the Kinesio Tape application, and at a 24-hour follow-up by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation of the patients. Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine the effects of the treatment on each outcome variable, with group as the between-subjects variable and time as the within-subjects variable. The primary analysis was the group-by-time interaction.

Experimental laboratory study supplemented by a case series.
Twenty female patients with midfoot arthritis participated in the study. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Foot Function Index-Revised (FFI-R). Plantar loading during walking was measured in the following conditions: shoe only, shoe with 3Q insert, and shoe with FL insert. Repeated-measures analyses of variance with post hoc analyses were used for statistical analysis.

This study involved an Internet survey of members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA), comparisons using chi(2) and paired t test analyses.
Anthropometric measurements and lung function tests were performed in 26 infants after surgical repair of CDH and 26 non-CDH intensive care patients, matched for gestational age and birth weight. Spontaneously breathing infants were tested at a mean of 44 weeks postconceptional age (range, 36-58 weeks). Body weight, body length, respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (V(T)), functional residual capacity by body plethysmography (FRC(pleth)), respiratory compliance (C(rs)), and respiratory resistance (R(rs)) were measured.
We retrospectively analyzed the data on 3100 patients with CDH in the Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Study Group from 82 participating pediatric surgical centers (1995-2004). Covariates considered included prenatal and perinatal clinical information, specifics of surgical repair, and the duration of extracorporeal support.
We reviewed all patients in our pediatric trauma database (1997-2007) for pneumomediastinum after blunt injury. Patients were then subdivided into 2 groups: group I, isolated thoracic and group II, thoracic and additional injuries. Procedures and imaging were recorded, and outcomes were assessed.
A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with/without symptomatic tracheoesophageal compression secondary to anomalies of the aortic arch and great vessels diagnosed from 1970 to 2008. A total of 183 patients underwent surgical repair. Median age at the time of the operation was 5 months (range, 3 days to 30 years). Patients were classified into 5 major subtypes based on their surgical anatomy as follows: right aortic arch-left ligamentum (n = 77), double aortic arch (n = 67), aberrant (retroesophageal) right subclavian artery (n = 30), pulmonary sling (n = 8), and innominate artery compression (n = 1). Six patients (3%) had an associated Kommerell diverticulum. In patients with a double aortic arch, 82% had a dominant right arch and 18% had a dominant left arch. Preoperatively, 80 patients (44%) had stridor, and 86 patients (47%) had recurrent upper respiratory tract infection.
Twenty-four adolescent and adult patients with asymmetric pectus excavatum (14-30 years of age) with no history of surgery were investigated in this study. The fifth and sixth ribs and costal cartilages were individually traced to measure their full lengths on 3-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) images. As an index of asymmetry, sternal rotation angle was measured in the chest CT images. Patients with a 21 degrees or greater angle of sternal twist were designated as an asymmetric group and those with an angle of smaller than 20 degrees as a symmetric group. Lateral differences in the fifth and sixth costal and costal cartilage lengths were compared between the groups.
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 45 children who had surgery from 1979 to 2005 for EHPVO in our institution, consisting of 38 PSSS and 7 portal reperfusion procedures (PRPs). We assessed the presence of liver nodules on ultrasonography.
From 1979 to 2003, 57 children have been operated by the Kasai procedure. Only 40 of these have had their portal plate removed for histologic examination. We divided the patients according to clinical outcome into a successful and a failure group and compared the histologic features of the portal plates in the 2 groups. Afterward, the portal plate histology from EHBA was compared with the porta hepatis area from patients dead from other causes.
A retrospective analysis of all children treated for achalasia at a tertiary center from 1981 to 2007 was performed (n = 40). Demographics, presenting symptoms, perioperative parameters, and outcomes were analyzed using t tests and chi(2) statistics.
Records of 89 minor and 22 giant OC children were reviewed. A questionnaire on general health was sent to all patients. A second questionnaire concerning quality of life and functional status; Darthmouth COOP Functional Health Assessment Charts/WONCA (COOP/WONCA) was sent to all patients aged 18 years or older and a peer control group.
We conducted a retrospective review of patients with gastroschisis born from 1989 to 2007. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Preterm healthy neonates, with gestational age from 26 to 36 weeks, were used as controls.
The children underwent laparoscopic procedures under general anesthesia, and they were mechanically ventilated. Blood samples were obtained after induction of anesthesia, at the end of the surgery, and were centrifuged at 3000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes to separate plasma. The plasma total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI) were determined.
Our vascular access team consists of a consultant surgeon and 2 consultant anesthetists. All procedures were prospectively recorded on a database and were either performed or directly supervised by our team.
We reviewed 721 consecutive vascular access patients who had vascular access surgery by a single surgeon during the previous 5 years. Ten patients 20 years or younger were included in this study. In addition to physical examination, each patient had preoperative vascular ultrasound mapping by the operating surgeon. A radiocephalic AVF (RC-AVF) at the wrist was the first choice for dialysis access when feasible; however, the patients in this report were generally seen after years of intravenous access and venipunctures that necessitated more proximal AVF constructions. A proximal radial artery AVF (PRA-AVF) was our most common choice for vascular access when an RC-AVF was not suitable.
From 1999 to 2003, 101 children with CA (76.5% of initial survivors) were seen 6-monthly in a tertiary children's hospital. Growth, neurologic outcome, mental and psychomotor development as determined with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and categorization of predictive sociodemographic and medical variables of the children were evaluated prospectively and longitudinally.
This study was conducted in children between 2 and 6 years old, divided into 2 groups of 10 pairs each. The experimental group received psychologic intervention, whereas the control group did not. One month after the surgery, they were reevaluated and compared with the same instruments used in the beginning of the study. The instruments used were as follows: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory with the mothers and the Rutter's Child Behavior A2 Scale and the Posthospital Behavior Questionnaire with the children.
All consecutive patients treated for HLHS at our institution during 1969 to 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. The number of patients with histologically confirmed HD or clinical findings characteristic of HD such as constipation and delayed meconium were recorded from the patient records.
From 1998 to 2005, 97 children with HD underwent the modified Swenson's procedure in this institute. They were classified into 2 groups based on pathologic investigation as follows: group A contained 70 patients with HD and group B contained 27 patients with HD complicated with HYP. The mean follow-up time from the time of the operation was 3.4 years (range, 1.5-8 years). The incidence of postoperative EC and anorectal functions were evaluated and compared between these 2 groups.
Nine babies who were identified from 2 centers in the Republic of South Africa with fetal extraperitoneal rectal perforation are presented. The details of these babies were obtained retrospectively from the case notes.
We retrospectively analyzed 250 children after proctocolectomy with either SIAA or JPAA, for the first 3 years after pull-through. A functional stooling score was developed to further assess outcomes. Data were analyzed using chi(2) tests and generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures.
We prospectively randomized 134 children undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy at our institution to have skin closure with either skin adhesive (n = 64) or subcuticular closure (n = 70). Data collected included age, sex, weight, type of operation, total operative time, and skin closure time. Digital photographs of healing incisions were taken at the 6-week postoperative visit. The operating surgeon assessed cosmetic outcome of incisions using a previously validated visual analog scale, as well as an ordinate scale. A blinded assessment of cosmetic outcome was then performed by an independent surgeon comparing these photographs to the visual analog scale. Operating room time and resource use (ie, costs) relative to the skin closure were assessed. Comparisons between groups were done using Student's t tests and chi(2) tests.
We conducted a structured review of the literature for cases explicitly identified as congenital fourth branchial arch anomalies or meeting anatomical criteria for this condition. We computed descriptive statistics and performed several post hoc 2-way comparisons of subgroups of cases.
Four cases operated for torsion of WS are retrospectively reviewed. Ages at presentation were, respectively, 30 months, 5 years, 4 years, and 3 years, without sex preference. All subjects led a history of abdominal pain and a mass on physical examination.
Twenty recently extracted molars were selected, and standard MOD inlay preparations were made with the gingival margins located below the cemento-enamel junction. The teeth were assigned to 4 experimental groups (n=5) according to the indirect composite restoration cementation technique used: (1) immediate dentin sealing with Adper Single Bond (TEBI); (2) conventional adhesive cementation technique using Adper Single Bond (TEAI); (3) immediate dentin sealing using Adper Prompt L-Pop (SEBI); or (4) conventional adhesive cementation technique using Adper Prompt L-Pop (SEAI). The restored teeth were thermal cycled 1,000 times between 5 degrees and 55 degrees C and then immersed in 50% ammoniacal silver nitrate. Three specimens per restoration were evaluated for microleakage, according to predefined scores, and submitted to Friedman's test (alpha=.05). The specimens were then sectioned to obtain 0.8 +/-0.2-mm-thick sticks (with n ranging from 32 to 57 specimens) and submitted to microtensile bond strength (muTBS) testing. The obtained data were submitted to 2-way ANOVA test (alpha=.05).
We did a prospective trial to assess the effectiveness of TMMR without adjuvant radiation in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB, IIA, and selected IIB cervical cancer. We also generated MRI-based pelvic relapse landscapes from patients who had experienced pelvic failure after conventional radical hysterectomy.
59 genes were selected using an innovative data-mining strategy, and were profiled in the largest neuroblastoma patient series (n=579) to date using real-time quantitative PCR starting from only 20 ng of RNA. A multigene-expression signature was built using 30 training samples, tested on 313 test samples, and subsequently validated in a blind study on an independent set of 236 tumours.
Women aged 20-64 years who were undergoing routine screening as part of the English National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme in Greater Manchester were randomly assigned (between July, 2001, and September, 2003) in a ratio of 3:1 to either combined LBC and HPV testing in which the results were revealed and acted on, or to combined LBC and HPV testing where the HPV result was concealed from the patient and investigator. The primary outcome was the detection rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) in the second screening round, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN25417821.
The SOS study started in 1987 and involved 2010 obese patients (body-mass index [BMI] &gt;or=34 kg/m(2) in men, and &gt;or=38 kg/m(2) in women) who underwent bariatric surgery and 2037 contemporaneously matched obese controls, who received conventional treatment. While the main endpoint of SOS was overall mortality, the main outcome of this exploratory report was cancer incidence until Dec 31, 2005. Cancer follow-up rate was 99.9% and the median follow-up time was 10.9 years (range 0-18.1 years).
Breast milk and mothers' and infants' plasma phospholipid FA concentrations from birth to 44 weeks of gestational age were analysed and compared with mothers' food intake, assessed using a 3-day diary. Fatty acids were analysed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography.
Isolates collected from 75 and 89 children with uncomplicated malaria infection living in a rural and an urban area of Burkina Faso, respectively, were analysed by a nested PCR amplification of msp1 and msp2 genes to compare P. falciparum diversity.
A transversal prospective study was carried out during a period of 15 months in which 20 fractures of femur from 19 patients were included, corresponding to 10 imminent fractures (IF) and 10 established fractures. Assessed final outcomes were associated complications, walking type at discharge and change in Karnofsky's scale after surgery. Mortality and survival after operation were also registered.
Big endothelin-1 levels were measured in a cohort of 90 outpatients (age 64 (13), 70% males) diagnosed with HF. Patients were functionally classified (NYHA).
A follow up study of a cohort of patients was carried out. 265 B-CLL patients diagnosed in the Area Sanitaria de Gij√≥n during 10 years (1997-2007) were analysed in this study. The overall survival of the patients was analysed by the Rai and Binet staging systems and the prognostic indexes proposed by the MDACC and GIMEMA group.
We conducted a retrospective study on all hospital discharged patients diagnosed with SBP in the period from January 2003 to December 2005, obtaining a total of 158 episodes. Two groups of patients were created: those over 65 (group 1: 73 episodes) and those aged 65 years (group 2: 86 episodes). A descriptive study, an analysis of survival by Kaplan Meier curves (compared with log-rank test) and a Cox regression analysis was conducted comparing the two groups.
We (a group of education researchers from Europe and North America) set out to examine the comprehensibility of a defined set of recently published medical education papers. We surveyed all the articles published in four major international journals on medical education during the first 5 months of 2008 and searched for terminology that might prove obscure or confusing to an international readership.
A pre-test, simulation-based training intervention and post-test design was used. Two objective structured assessments of technical skills (OSATS) and a bench-top simulation training session were administered at the Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Participants included 19 surgical residents who volunteered as trainees. Five surgical faculty members and one senior resident from the Black Lion Hospital, as well as two faculty members from the University of Toronto, participated as trainers and evaluators. The intervention consisted of OSATS tests comprising four stations, covering knot tying, closure of skin laceration, elliptical excision and bowel anastomosis. Tests were separated by 2-hour practice sessions. Main outcome measures included previously validated instruments comprising global rating scales (GRS) and skill-specific checklists (SSC).
In 2007, a multi-institutional, cross-sectional survey was conducted at 37 hospitals. A total of 619 residents (409 men, 210 women) were recruited. Prevalence of mistreatment in six categories was evaluated: verbal abuse; physical abuse; academic abuse; sexual harassment; gender discrimination, and alcohol-associated harassment. In addition, alleged abusers, the emotional effects of abusive experiences, and reluctance to report the abuse to superiors were investigated. Male and female responses were statistically compared using chi-square analysis.
The purpose of this paper is to remedy that situation by providing an overview of mixed methods research, research design models relevant for medical education research, examples of each research design model in medical education research, and basic guidelines for medical education researchers interested in mixed methods research.
In Phase 1, 88 teaching team members from internal and emergency medicine were observed during clinical activities (216 hours), and 65 participants completed brief interviews. In Phase 2, 36 in-depth interviews were conducted using video vignettes. Data collection and analysis employed grounded theory methodology.
Year 4 medical students were randomised to either guided or experiential learning. Students in the guided group were taught using the conventional step-by-step technique. Students in the experiential group had to work out the correct technique for intubation on their own. Both groups had further opportunities to intubate manikins and patients during their postings. The students were recalled 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later, and their intubation skills assessed in four major categories: equipment preparation; intubation technique; successful intubation, and placement confirmation.
A pilot study with 10 students was conducted to show the feasibility of the methods and some evidence of modality-specific learning (the Harvey-trained group scored 72% correct on Harvey and 36% correct on CD test examples; the CD-trained group scored 60% correct on both CD and Harvey test examples). A main study was then initiated involving 37 Year 3 medical students from the University of Leeds. They received 1 hour of common instruction, after which one group received 3 hours of specific instruction on Harvey. The second group received 3 hours of instruction using a CD. Six weeks later, both groups were tested blind with real patients with stable heart sounds. Stations were observed by an examiner who scored communication skills and examination skills using 5-point scales.
A strategy for interprofessional team-working was developed in a large maternity unit in the UK, with a variety of interprofessional interventions spanning the attachment and opportunities to participate in specific task or research teams. These interventions were evaluated before the strategy proceeded to large-scale implementation, with a validated attitudes questionnaire (Pollard) and a reaction survey.
Participants were 133 undergraduate students from eight hospitals taking part in four clerkship rotations. All students recorded the time they spent on eight clerkship activities over 2 weeks and completed the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM). Partial correlation analyses were undertaken to examine the relationship between the amount of time students spent on each activity and their PHEEM scores.
A total of 72 doctors and nurses participated in this 8-month study on a paediatric in-patient ward. Eighty hours of non-participant observations and 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted. All data were rendered anonymous prior to analysis. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, one researcher read and analysed all data recursively. As emergent themes were identified, exemplary portions of the data were discussed with three additional researchers to resolve discrepancies and confirm the coding structure. Expertise literatures informed the final analyses.
During a paediatrics clerkship, trained lay observers (standardised observers [SOs]) assessed the communication skills of Year 3 medical students while the students interviewed patients. These observers accompanied students into examination rooms in an out-patient clinic and completed a 15-item communication skills checklist during the encounter. The reliability of the communication skills scores was calculated using generalisability analysis. Students rated the experience and the validity of the assessment. The communication skills scores recorded by the SOs in the clinic were correlated with communication skills scores on a paediatrics objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).
A total of 100 videotaped assessed consultations between SPs and Year 3 medical students were transcribed. Words by each participant were counted, and interruptions were coded and counted. Amount of talk and interruptions were chosen because they are potential markers of conversational dominance.
We drew upon the Dutch Inter-University Progress Test (PT) to measure impact on knowledge acquisition and compared PT scores of 393 CMC students with scores of 1028 ICMC students (Years 2-6) in a cross-sectional design. We also compared the scores of 112 CMC students with those of 197 ICMC students in Years 3-6 in a longitudinal design.
Biodegradable polymers PLGA and PCL are used in various ratios for nanoparticle preparation using the water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion technique for water-soluble DXY. The physicochemical characterization of nanoparticles included size and surface charge measurement, study of surface morphology using scanning-electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study, differential scanning calorimetry analysis and in vitro release kinetics study.
Physical examination, laboratory investigations including hemoglobin levels and white blood cell counts, genetic testing, CT, bone-marrow biopsy, immunophenotyping by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, polymerase chain reaction analyses, fluorescence in situ hybridization, sputum culture and diagnostic splenectomy.
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.
Outcome of patients suffering from a TBI has significantly improved with the rapid application of vital supporting measures in addition to a strict control of blood and intracranial pressure at the intensive care units. However no specific treatment for post-traumatic brain lesions has proven as efficacious in the clinical settings. A deeper knowledge of the physiopathological events associated with TBI is necessary for the development of new specific therapies. Due to the heterogeneity of the human TBI, each experimental model has been designed to reproduce a different type of brain lesion. Experimental TBI models allow the study of the dynamic evolution of brain injuries under controlled conditions. Usefulness of experimental models is limited by their reliability and reproducibility among different researchers. Small rodents have been the preferred animals to reproduce TBI injuries, mainly due to the similar cerebral physiology shared by these animals and the human beings.
Thirty albino Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups of 10 each: the sham-operated control group (group 1), the spinal cord trauma group (group 2), and the spinal cord trauma plus AK 295 treatment group (group 3). After having received a combination of ketamine 60 mg/kg and xylazine 9 mg/kg to induce anesthesia, the rats in groups 2 and 3 were subjected to thoracic trauma by the weight drop technique (40 g-cm). One hour after having been subjected to that trauma, the rats in groups 2 and 3 were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of either dimethyl sulfoxide 2 mg/kg or AK 295 2 mg/kg. The effects of the injury and the efficacy of AK 295 were determined by an assessment of the TUNEL technique and the results of examination with a light microscope. The neurologic performance of 5 rats from group 2 and 5 from group 3 was assessed by means of the inclined plane technique and the modified Tarlov's motor grading scale 1, 3, and 5 days after spinal cord trauma.
From June 1997 to May 2006 we implanted bioabsorbable fixation systems in 216 patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis. Age at treatment ranged between 4 and 24 months (mean age 6.38 months). Brain computed tomography (CT) scans, and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of CT scans were performed before and after treatment. An 82: 18 L-lactic acid: glycolic acid copolymer was used in 92.2% of these cases, and a 70:30 L-lactic acid: D-lactic acid copolymer was used in the remaining 7.8% of cases. The follow-up of the patients ranged between six months and five years.
While the conventional real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of ERRBs and ErbB4-processing protease genes, the LightCycler fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes were specifically designed to investigate all of the known ERBB4 juxtamembrane (JM) and cytoplasmic transcript variants.
A series of 146 diffuse gliomas, including 45 oligodendrogliomas, 42 oligoastrocytomas and 59 astrocytomas, were analysed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography for 1p and 19q status and by immunohistochemistry for MGMT, p53 and Ki-67 expression patterns. The molecular alterations were then correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and with each other.
Expression of phosphorylated Cav-1 was determined by immunoblotting and dual labelling immunofluorescence for phosphorylated caveolin-1 and fibronectin, a marker of BBB breakdown. A phospho-specific monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes only tyrosine 14-phosphorylated Cav-1 (PY14Cav-1) was used.
175 persons (students of economics, students at the university clinic for psychoanalysis, and prospective psychotherapists) were interviewed concerning terms of familiarity and popularity of the therapeutic methods. Using the semantic differential we tried to operationalize the resonant connotative associations.
We tested 49 depressive patients who participated in 9 PE group sessions at twice weekly intervals. Psychometric observer-rating and self-rating scales were conducted before and after PE completion.
A 41-year-old man presented with an insular hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by rupture of a small aneurysm on a perforating artery of the proximal middle cerebral artery supplying the insula.
This rare aneurysm was resected via the transsylvian-insular approach.
A 67-year-old man in his usual state of health experienced an acute confusion episode preceded by a valsalva maneuver. The episode lasted approximately 60 minutes. Afterward he was able to remember everything that occurred. A magnetic resonance imaging scan suggested a right parietal dural arteriovenous fistula, which was confirmed by angiography. A seizure was ruled out by clinical examination and an electroencephalogram.
The patient underwent therapeutic embolization and surgical ligation of the fistula. Feeding vessels to the malformation were cauterized within the leaves of the falx, and the draining vein was clipped with a titanium aneurysm clip and divided. An intraoperative angiogram was then performed, which showed obliteration of the fistula. There was no demonstrable confusion or memory loss noted postoperatively.
The patient presented with a progressive left-sided weakness 62 years after initial surgery for a right parietal cerebral abscess, which included the instillation of Thorotrast into the abscess cavity. Computed tomography showed a right parietal tumor.
An explorative craniotomy showed an intrinsic, infiltrating, very vascular tumor with surrounding calcification. The tumor appeared to arise from a benign cavernous vasoformative lesion intimately associated with a Thorotrast-type granuloma. The patient declined further surgery or radiotherapy.
The 23-year-old patient presented with recurring headaches. She had right-sided hypoglossal nerve palsy for approximately 5 to 6 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extracranial tumor with contact to the cranial base originating from the hypoglossal nerve.
The tumor was extirpated surgically and verified histologically as a schwannoma of the hypoglossal nerve.
A 5-year-old boy presented with diabetes insipidus and an enhancing lesion of the pituitary stalk without evidence of extracranial disease.
The lesion was biopsied via an endoscopic intraventricular approach without complications. Pathological examination revealed Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
A 43-year-old man presented with numbness and a burning pain in his left upper back and extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cervical-thoracic syrinx that terminated relatively abruptly at T4. Because of the abrupt termination of the syrinx at T4 and the slight ventral displacement of the spinal cord at this level, a dorsal arachnoid web was suspected.
A T4 laminectomy was performed. Intraoperative ultrasound before opening of the thecal sac showed a pulsating transverse dorsal arachnoid web. The dura was opened and the web resected, thus widely communicating the dorsal subarachnoid space. The syrinx dramatically decreased in size and the patient's pain improved but did not resolve completely.
We conducted a retrospective review with follow-up of 164 patients who underwent microsurgical resection of supratentorial CCMs. Clinical and radiographic data were collected and then analyzed to determine predictors of developing epilepsy and predictors of postoperative seizure control after microsurgical resection.
Between September 1997 and June 2008, a total of 656 meningiomas were operated on by the senior author (JH) at the Department of Neurosurgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital; 66 were olfactory meningiomas. We retrospectively analyze the clinical data, radiological findings, surgical treatment, histology, and outcome of all the olfactory groove meningioma patients and discuss the operative techniques used.
Between 1991 and 2007, 21 patients (19 women and 2 men; mean age, 51.1 +/- 10.6 years) harboring symptomatic CS meningiomas underwent transsphenoidal decompression. Sufficient bone removal, opening of the inferomedial wall of the CS, and tumor debulking were performed.
Fifty-five transsphenoidal surgeries were performed for macroadenomas (modified Hardy's Grade II-IV) resections. All of the surgical processes were guided by real-time updated contrast T1-weighted coronal and sagittal images, which were acquired with 0.15 Tesla PoleStar N20 iMRI (Medtronic Navigation, Louisville, CO). The definitive benefits as well as major drawbacks of low-field iMRI in transsphenoidal surgery were assessed with respect to intraoperative imaging, tumor resection control, comparison with early postoperative high-field magnetic resonance imaging, and follow-up outcomes.
Arachnoid tissue and CSF from the cisterna magna (CSFCM) was sampled at the time of primary tumor resection. Results were compared with conventional staging methods (M stage) and correlated with patient outcome.
From 1991 to 2007, 92 hemangioblastomas in 31 patients, 26 with von Hippel-Lindau disease, were treated with radiosurgery (27 tumors treated with frame-based linear accelerator radiosurgery, and 67 tumors were treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery). The mean patient age was 41 years (range, 18-81 years). The radiation dose to the tumor periphery averaged 23.4 Gy (range, 12-40 Gy). The mean tumor volume was 1.8 cm (range, 0.058-65.4 cm). Tumor response was evaluated in serial, contrast-enhanced, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging scans.
This is a retrospective review of a prospective, multicentered database of adults with spinal deformity. At the time of enrollment and follow-up, patients completed standardized questionnaires, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Scoliosis Research Society 22 questionnaire (SRS-22), and assessment of back pain using a numeric rating scale (NRS) score, with 0 and 10 corresponding to no and maximal pain, respectively. The initial plan for surgical or nonoperative treatment was made at the time of enrollment.
Nineteen consecutive patients with intracanalicular disc herniations of the upper lumbar levels underwent the oblique paraspinal approach, which utilizes an operating microscope, from March 2005 through January 2008. Their clinical and radiological data were collected and analyzed. The patients were assessed with standard examinations preoperatively and evaluated with dynamic lumbar x-rays, 3-dimensional computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging, standard pain and disability measurements, a visual analogue scale, the Oswestry disability index, and a patient satisfaction rate that checked their pain scores postoperatively.
This was a longitudinal prospective study of 50 patients with a diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis who were treated by microendoscopic decompression using an 18-mm METRx tubular retractor according to the METRx technique (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN). Twenty of the patients had an additional disc prolapse, and a microendoscopic discectomy was associated with decompressive laminectomy. The results were evaluated using the visual analog scale pain score, Oswestry Disability Index score, patient satisfaction questionnaire, and modified Macnab classification.
Sixty-nine patients were treated with the X-Stop. Forty-six single-level and 23 double-level operations (92 devices) were performed according to recommended indications. The mean follow-up duration was 23 months.
High-resolution magnetic resonance angiography and fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition were performed preoperatively in 17 patients with neurovascular compression syndromes (facial spasm, n = 10; trigeminal neuralgia, n = 7) using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Computer graphics models were created with computer software and observed interactively for detection of offending vessels by rotation, enlargement, reduction, and retraction on a graphic workstation. Two-dimensional images were reviewed by 2 radiologists blinded to the clinical details, and 2 neurosurgeons predicted the offending vessel with the interactive visualization method before surgery. Predictions from the 2 imaging approaches were compared with surgical findings. The vessels identified during surgery were assumed to be the true offending vessels.
The authors reviewed 1642 cases of HFS. Assessments were based on clinical features, 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, and surgical findings. Causes other than neurovascular compression at the root exit zone of the facial nerve were investigated and unusual clinical presentations were noted.
Somatic mutations were sought in DNA from 3 surgically excised, fresh-frozen CCM lesions by cloning and screening polymerase chain reaction products generated from KRIT1 or PDCD10 coding regions. Laser capture microdissection was used on isolated endothelial and nonendothelial cells to determine whether somatic mutations were found in endothelial cells.
A total of 37 carotid plaques underwent ex vivo VH-IVUS within 24 hours after endarterectomy. Ninety-five segments of virtual histological images were matched to histological sections. The area of the necrotic core on histological sections was compared with that on virtual histological images. Intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) was histopathologically graded by its severity using immunohistochemical staining for glycophorin A as a marker. The relationship of the severity of the IPH to the necrotic core was histopathologically evaluated. The correlation between the necrotic core or IPH with symptomatology was also evaluated.
Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were performed in 70 cases of human gliomas and normal brain tissues. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The literature supporting the role of stretch damage as a primary cause of nerve root injury and pain was systematically reviewed. Pathoanatomic considerations between nerve roots and juxtaposed environment are described and correlated with the available literature. Potential anatomic relationships that may lead to stretch-induced injury are delineated.
De novo bifurcations were surgically created using both native common carotid arteries in each of 6 dogs. Bifurcations were imaged 2 weeks or 2 months after surgery by high-resolution 3-dimensional angiography, from which flow fields were obtained by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Subsequently, harvested tissues, demonstrating early aneurysmal changes near the apex, were immunostained for interleukin-1beta, endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases, nitrotyrosine, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. Spatial distributions of these molecules were comapped with computational fluid dynamics results.
Controlled cortical impact injury was performed in adult male Wistar rats. The rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, saline control group, and simvastatin treatment group. Simvastatin was administered orally starting at day 1 after TBI until animals were killed at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 after treatment. Functional outcome was measured using modified neurological severity scores. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and to identify activated microglial cells and astrocytes.
Adult female Wistar rats (n = 24) were injured with controlled cortical impact and divided into 3 groups. The first 2 groups were treated with simvastatin (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) administered orally for 14 days starting 1 day after TBI. The third group (control) received phosphate-buffered saline orally for 14 days. Neurological functional outcome was measured with modified neurological severity scores performed 1 day before TBI; on days 1, 4, 7, 14 after TBI; and biweekly thereafter. All animals were sacrificed 3 months after TBI. Brain tissues of half of the animals were processed for preparation of paraffin-embedded sections for immunohistological studies. The remaining half were frozen for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies for quantification of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and cortex.
Fischer-344 rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) underwent a transabdominal approach for implantation of a CRL-1666 breast adenocarcinoma cell line within the L6 vertebral body. In experiment 1, 7 days after tumor implantation, animals underwent 1 of 2 treatments or no treatment (n = 8 per group): control (no treatment); surgery alone (L6 corpectomy); or surgery + OncoGel (L6 corpectomy with OncoGel implantation into the resection cavity). In experiment 2, 7 days after tumor implantation, animals underwent 1 of 2 treatments or no treatment (n = 8 per group): control (no treatment); surgery + XRT (L6 corpectomy followed by XRT [total 20 Gy]); or surgery + XRT + OncoGel (L6 corpectomy with OncoGel implantation followed by XRT). In experiment 3, 7 days after tumor implantation, animals underwent 1 of 2 treatments or no treatment (n = 8 per group): control (no treatment); XRT alone (total 20 Gy); or XRT + OncoGel. Daily hindlimb function was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale (range, 1-21).
The PHQ-9 scale was completed by 103 participants with low vision. These data were then assessed for fit to the Rasch model.
A literature search was conducted that included the original report published in 1910 of the fitting of the patient. The dimensions and back vertex power of a blown scleral shell were measured.
Twenty presbyopic subjects were fitted with either the PureVision multifocal contact lens or monovision with PureVision single vision lenses. After a 1-month trial, the following assessments of visual function were made: (a) distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity (VA); (b) reading ability; (c) distance and near contrast sensitivity function (CSF); (d) near range of clear vision; (e) stereoacuity; and (f) subjective evaluation of near vision ability with a standardized questionnaire. Subjects were then refitted with the alternative correction and the procedure was repeated. All measurements were compared between the two corrections, whereas the "low addition" multifocal lens was also compared with the "high addition" alternative.
Ten subjects were recruited to wear galyfilcon A lenses (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) followed by lotrafilcon B lenses (O2 Optix, CIBA Vision) each for four consecutive days. Each day, subjects inserted a new pair of lenses for 8 h of wear after which both lenses were removed using forceps (lenses were not rubbed or rinsed after removal). Lenses were pooled in one of four commercially available care solutions for a 24-h soak followed by precipitation, resuspension in water, and quantification by Bradford assay and identification by mass spectrometry.
Systematic observations were made at beaches, parks and outdoor public swimming pools in Honolulu, Hawaii on sunny days between November 2005 and June 2007. Observations were conducted independently by two trained observers between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. During each observation period, each individual in the area was coded for gender, age category, clothing coverage, shade use, and use of sunglasses.
A total of 29 symptomatic CI subjects aged 45 to 68 years were examined. All subjects took the CI Symptom Survey V-15 (CISS) and scored &gt;or=16 points. Each subject was assigned two pairs of progressive addition glasses made by the same manufacturer in a randomized sequence, one with BI prism and one with the same lens prescription but no prism (placebo). Subjects wore each pair of glasses for 3 weeks and completed the CISS at the end of the 3rd week. Symptom level measured with CISS was the major outcome measure.
Eighteen 1-year-old cats were randomly fitted with an OK lens in one eye and an alignment fitted (AF) lens in the other eye. Both lenses were made in the same diameter and central thickness and of the same material. Two separate wearing periods of 2 weeks and 6 weeks were used. After each wearing period, lenses were soaked in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6294 or 6206) for 10 min. The lenses were then reinserted onto their respective corneas for a wearing period of 16 hours after which lenses were collected and remaining adhered bacteria quantified. Unworn control lenses were also soaked and bacteria enumerated for comparison.
Sixteen control and sixteen dry eye subjects performed four visual tasks (looking straight ahead, watching a movie, identifying rapidly changing letters, and playing a computer game) while blink patterns and fluorescein images of the tear film were videotaped. Pre and posttesting symptom questionnaires, querying the intensity of nine symptoms of ocular irritation, were completed by all subjects. Blink rate and blink amplitude were computed from digitized videos. The percentage of tear film break-up before the blink was calculated.
Thirty eyes (15 subjects) entered a masked, randomized, cross-over study. Each eye was fitted with the spherical and toric lens of the following brands in random order: Acuvue Advance, Biomedics 55, Frequency 55, and SofLens 66. HOAs were measured using the Zywave II Aberrometer over a 6-mm aperture up to fifth order. A linear model accounting for the fixed effect of lens type and random effects of subject and eye was created. Paired t-tests were completed between lens brands within the spherical and toric lenses and between the spherical and toric lens within each brand. Best-corrected visual acuity (VA) was measured and compared.
Seven participants with normal color vision performed the panel tests at each of five viewing distances from 0.5 to 7.56 m (chromatic portions of the caps subtending 75 to 5 minarc). To obtain cutoff values for the numeric indices at the standard viewing distance under our viewing conditions, we also tested 69 unselected, volunteers with the Farnsworth D-15 and Lanthony desaturated D-15 panels. From each participant one eye, usually the worse, was included in analyses to find the 90th percentiles for each index, which we used as cutoff values. Many of the participants also made Rayleigh anomaloscope matches.
Tears were collected from 10 healthy subjects and 10 DES patients. Carnitine levels were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Streptococcus sanguinis NCTC 10904 and Streptococcus ratti FA-1 were grown in suspension cultures and mono-organism biofilms. ADS activity at pH values of 4, 5 and 6 was assessed, and the actions of the agents was determined in terms of reduced production of alkali from arginine, inhibition of ADS enzymes and changes in uptake of arginine.
In this study, we investigated the gene SMU.1426c in the amino-sugar metabolism pathway of S. mutans UA159, which encodes phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM). The glmM gene that functions in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan has been well investigated in Escherichia coli. Here a glmM mutant strain of S. mutans UA159 was constructed and several virulence properties were investigated.
Ten E. faecalis strains were isolated from root canals of teeth undergoing retreatment following unsuccessful endodontic therapy. Mitomycin C was used to induce any prophages present in the bacterial isolates. The induced phages were purified and examined using electron microscopy. The DNA extracted from one of the phage isolates was subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose electrophoresis analysis.
Human gingival cells (Ca9-22) were cultured in bacterial extracts prepared from A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. The cells were pretreated with protease inhibitors or transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2).
HGF from healthy periodontal tissue were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Escherichia coli. We also initiated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in HGF. The HMGB1 released in the supernatants from stimulated or dying cells was measured. Immunocytochemical staining against HMGB1 was performed in LPS-stimulated HGF.
Subgingival plaque and saliva samples, collected from 30 healthy pregnant women and 24 healthy non-pregnant women as their controls, were examined for the presence of pigmented gram-negative anaerobes. Altogether 2628 isolates were preliminarily identified as P. intermedia sensu lato, based on phenotypic testing. Their further identification was performed by using a 16S ribosomal DNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Adhesion and invasion were assayed by standard antibiotic/culture assays and fluorescent microscopy techniques. The effect of Prevotella strains on epithelial cell viability was measured using a commercial cell proliferation assay.
In this study, five forward primers and a reverse primer were designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to the partial sequences of the rpoB genes of these oral Veillonella species.
Excised tumor samples (65 OSCC patients) and exfoliated cells from potentially malignant lesions (from 44 and 119 patients with OL and OLP, respectively) as well as from healthy controls (72 individuals) were analysed. OLPs were classified based on clinical appearance, 61 patients had erosive-atrophic lesions (associated with higher malignancy risk, EA-OLP) and 58 had non-erosive non-atrophic lesions (with lower risk of becoming malignant, non-EA-OLP), respectively. Exfoliated cells collected from apparently healthy mucosa accompanied each lesion sample. HPV was detected by MY/GP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyped by restriction analysis of amplimers. Copy numbers in lesions were determined using real-time PCR. Prevalence rates, copy number distributions, and association with risk factors and diseases were analysed using chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression, respectively.
Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Actinomyces naeslundii were used. Effects of physiological acidification at pH 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at pH 4.0-7.0, were investigated.
GECs were cultured from biopsies derived from three different healthy donors (n = 3). To obtain naturally formed biofilm (NFB), polymer disks were attached to prostheses and carried intraorally for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. In addition, single-species biofilms (SSB; Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis) were cultured on polymer disks in vitro (12, 24, 36, and 48 h). The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of hBD-2, RNAase-7, PSO, IL-8, 5-LO, and glycerylaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was analysed using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
This study examines the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on BM-Mvarphi TLR expression and activation, cell signaling, cytokine production, and phagocytic function in the diabetic state, when challenged with the periodontal stimulus Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to further understand how diabetes and associated hyperglycemia may contribute to the increased susceptibility of people with diabetes to periodontitis.
Whole saliva was collected from 14 periodontitis patients, 15 gingivitis patients and 13 complete denture wearers. The study subjects were systemically healthy and had not received periodontal treatment in the past 3 months. Real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the salivary load of HCMV and EBV.
Subgingival plaque was collected from 41 patients with chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects. The prevalence of Archaea in those plaque samples was tested by polymerase chain reaction with two broad-range archaeal primer sets. Amplicons from eight Archaea-positive plaque samples were cloned and sequenced for molecular diversity analysis using one of these two primer sets and a novel third primer set.
Endodontic specimens were aseptically obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. Protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-LC-MS/MS followed by a database search.
Seven patients from the National Specialist Commissioning Group Centre for Alstr√∂m Disease, Torbay, England, UK, completed the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging protocol to assess cardiac structure and function in Alstr√∂m cardiomyopathy.
An in vitro bovine heart model was used to measure surface and tissue temperatures during RF delivery under conditions designed to cause steam pops. Sensitivity of type II MB (MBII) formation as a predictor of steam pops and for surface temperatures more than 80 degrees C was calculated.
Forty patients with tolerated VT post-MI were randomized to RF ablation with contact (group 1) or noncontact (group 2) mapping systems. In both groups ablation of tolerated VT was guided by VT activation map confirmed by concealed entrainment. When untolerated VTs were induced, ablation was performed in group 1 according to pace mapping starting from the scar border zone and in group 2 according to the VT activation map confirmed by pace mapping.
MI was induced in five sheep by percutaneous left anterior descending artery occlusion for 3 hours. Mapping was performed at 19 +/- 6 weeks post-MI. A total of 20 quadripolar transmural needles were deployed at thoracotomy in the LV within and surrounding scar. Bipolar pacing was performed from each needle to assess the effective refractory period (ERP) of the subendocardium and subepicardium. The activation (AT) and repolarization (RT) times, and modified activation recovery interval (ARI(m)) were determined from endocardial unipolar electrograms recorded in sinus rhythm simultaneously from all needles. Scarring was quantified histologically and compared with electrophysiological characteristics.
We report on three patients with recurrent unexplained syncope (despite extensive evaluation) who were labeled as having a psychogenic cause for their events. In each patient following placement of an implantable loop recorder, their syncopal events were found to be due to periods of prolonged asystole and/or complete heart block. One patient had prolonged asystole for 44 seconds. In each patient, episodes of syncope were eliminated following permanent pacemaker implantation.
This study consisted of AFL (group 1, N = 15) and non-AFL patients (group 2, N = 13). The CT structural characteristics were determined with intracardiac echocardiography. A 20-pole electrode catheter was located along the CT and pacing at progressively faster rates from either low anterolateral right atrium (LRA) or coronary sinus (CS) was applied.
We reviewed case records and device logs of 15 patients with ICDs or CRT-P or CRT-D devices who subsequently had implantation of a VentrAssist LVAD (Ventracor Ltd., Chatswood, Australia) as destination therapy or bridge to heart transplantation. Pacemaker and ICD lead parameters before and after LVAD implant were compared. In addition, ventricular tachyarrhythmia event logs and potential electromagnetic interference reports were evaluated.
Thirteen juvenile beagle dogs were fitted with a 4-Fr multipolar catheter placed transnasally into the esophagus to a level to sustain atrial capture. Pacing was established in nine dogs for 24 hours while four control dogs had catheters but no pacing stimulus applied. Paced dogs were divided into two groups: group A (n = 5) that were euthanized immediately and group B (n = 4) that were euthanized 7 days after the pacing period. Nonpaced dogs (group C, n = 4) were treated similar to group A. Gross and histological examination of the esophageal tissue was completed.
An infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without AIGIS(RX) was placed. The incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. After 7 days, devices were explanted and sampled for viable bacteria by swabbing and sonication.
This large single-center retrospective study sought to assess the role of ILR in the evaluation of potentially arrhythmic symptoms, both in terms of diagnosis of an arrhythmia as well as to rule out an arrhythmic cause. Clinical data, indications for ILR, interrogation reports, and further management strategies were collected in all 86 patients who received ILR from June 1999 to April 2008 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. The indications for ILR were unexplained syncope (76%), palpitations (14%), and presyncope or dizziness (10%).
Consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure who underwent ICD implantation and LV reconstruction were evaluated. During admission, two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (LV volumes and LVEF) was performed before surgery and was repeated at 3 months after surgery. Over a median follow-up of 18 months, the incidence of ICD therapy was evaluated.
In this paper, we report on a subject with Turner syndrome who also showed psychotic symptoms.
We investigated 102 participants with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID I and II) and the Symptom Check List (SCL-90).
A total of 5,356 elderly psychiatric inpatients (&gt; 65 years) with 7,658 episodes of inpatient care in a psychiatric university hospital between 1996 and 2006 was included in the study. Besides descriptive analyses, univariate analyses and binary logistic regression analyses were performed.

201 mothers of children with asthma (ages 6-12), recruited from community pediatric practices and emergency departments of 2 urban university hospitals.
Life events were measured using standardized items. Chronic stressors were measured using items from the International Asthma and Allergies in Childhood study and maternal and child exposure to violence. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale.
Secondary analysis of a national probability survey conducted by the CBS News/New York Times in January 2003.
Adult population in the United States, 18 years or older, having a telephone line at home.
The survey asked respondents a series of questions about demographics, pain characteristics, and utilization of pain treatment; logistic regression was used to identify variables predicting reported utilization of pain treatment.
An experimental study design was used. The experimental group received patient education through interactive multimedia about diabetes for 3 months, while the control group received a routine 3-month patient education.
On completion, 60 subjects from Taiwan were evaluated-30 in an experimental group and 30 in a control group.
Data were collected from both groups at baseline and at the completion of the patient education. The findings were then compared to evaluate the effects of the intervention on the subjects' knowledge of diabetes, blood sugar control, and self-care.

A descriptive survey was used in this community-based participatory research study with low-income women.
MSCT-CA was performed in 43 patients (31 men, 12 women, mean age 58.8+/-7.7 years) with stable angina after a routine diagnostic workup involving stress ECG and conventional CA. The following inclusion criteria were adopted: sinus rhythm and ability to hold breath for 12 s. Beta-blockers were administered in patients with heart rate&gt;or=70 beats/minute. In order to identify or exclude patients with significant stenoses (&gt;or=50% lumen), we determined posttest likelihood ratios of stress test and MSCT-CA separately and of MSCT-CA performed after the stress test.
Twenty-six consecutive patients, 14 with liver metastases (ten from colorectal cancer; four from carcinoid tumours) and 12 with biliary cancers (ten Klatskin tumours; one gallbladder tumour; one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) with insufficient predicted future remnant liver (FRL) underwent right PVE to induce hypertrophy of the contralateral hemiliver prior to surgical resection. Total liver volume, tumour volume and FRL volume were calculated on a 3D workstation. The ratio of the FRL to the total functional liver volume was &lt;30% in all patients.
Ninety-eight patients with cerebral tumours, 46 of which were primary (seven grade 0-I, nine low-grade gliomas, two gliomatosis cerebri, nine lymphomas and 19 high-grade gliomas) and 52 secondary, underwent conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging completed with DWI and dynamic contrast susceptibility PWI. Both ADC and rrCBV were calculated on a workstation by using Functool 2 software. Student's t test was used to determine any statistically significant differences in the ADC and rrCBV values.
Forty patients referred for endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries (n=23), peripheral vessels (n=14) or aorta (n=3) on the basis of previous clinical and diagnostic examinations underwent high-resolution whole-body MRA at 1.5 T with 3D spoiled gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequences, featuring parallel imaging acquisition technique with x2 acceleration factor. Sixty-eight surface coil elements and a four-station imaging protocol were employed. Biphasic intravenous administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent [gadolinium benzyloxyproprionic-tetraacetic acid (Gd-BOPTA)] was performed with the following protocol: 10 ml at a speed of 1 ml/s followed by further 10 ml at a speed of 0.5 ml/s. For image analysis, the arterial system was divided into 42 segments for evaluation. The presence or absence of atherosclerotic lesions was evaluated by two observers in consensus; segments were classified as having clinically significant disease (&gt;or=50% stenosis or an aneurysmal dilatation) or no significant disease (&lt;50% stenosis). The presence of stenoocclusive disease, determined at all segments, was compared with findings on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which were interpreted by a third independent reader. Sensitivity, specificity and concordance of whole-body MRA findings with DSA were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for all vascular territories.
Two hundred and thirty asymptomatic subjects (age range 45-80 years) were enrolled in the study. CT colonography was performed with standard patient preparation (no faecal tagging) and a 4-detector-row CT scanner. Image analysis was carried out with primary 2D analysis and the use of 3D endoluminal views to solve difficult cases. Patients were referred for conventional colonoscopy in the following situations: detection of three or more suspected lesions with maximum diameter&lt;or=6 mm; evidence of one or more lesions with maximum diameter&gt;6 mm; presence of colonic masses (maximum diameter&gt;3 cm).
Cyclopus was tested on a set of 120 mammograms on which the two compared commercial systems had been previously tested. The set consisted of mammograms reported as negative, preceding 31 interval cancers reviewed as screening error or minimal sign, and of 89 verified negative controls randomly selected from the same screening database.
From November 2003 to May 2008, ten ablation treatments were performed in ten patients with acute pain from metastatic bone lesions. Patient selection and choice of the most appropriate ablation treatment was made based on lesion characteristics. Three patients were treated with radiofrequency, one with plasma-mediated radiofrequency, two with plasma-mediated radiofrequency and cementoplasty, three with radiofrequency and cementoplasty and one with microwave.
The study considered insurance claims filed by radiologists of the Italian Society of Medical Radiology (SIRM) over a 12.5-year period between 1 January 1993 and 30 June 2005. We isolated claims related to presumed diagnostic errors in mammography. We then estimated the number of claims arising from events in the study period that are expected to be filed over the next few years, before the expiration of the prescriptive period of 10 years.
A total of 467 patients underwent a PET/CT scan using an iodinated contrast medium. We compared images obtained by the single PET scan, the single CT scan and by the fusion of the two procedures (PET/CT). The final diagnosis was obtained by histological examination and/or by the follow-up of all patients, including those who did not undergo surgery or biopsy.
With the collaboration of our physics department, we measured exposure on ten patients undergoing vertebroplasty with combined CT and fluoroscopic guidance and on ten undergoing vertebroplasty with fluoroscopic guidance alone.
Sixty-nine adult patients undergoing elective hand surgery were studied. Blocks were performed using conventional nerve stimulation technique. Needle advance began at 2 mA (1 Hz, 0.1 millisecond). When motor response (MR) occurred at less than 0.5 mA, needle position was fixed for "group &lt;0.5 mA." For "group 0.5-0.64 mA," the needle was withdrawn until MR occurred at greater than 0.5 mA and disappeared at less than 0.5 mA. For "group &gt;0.65 mA," the needle was withdrawn until MR occurred at greater than 0.65 mA and disappeared at less than 0.65 mA. For each group, patients received 8 mL of ropivacaine 7.5 mg/mL on the 4 nerves (radial, median, ulnar, and musculocutaneous). Primary end point was the number of failed radial nerve sensory blocks at 30 mins.
An economic cost comparison was performed on Mayo Clinic patients (n = 100) undergoing traditional total knee or total hip arthroplasty using the TJRA Clinical Pathway. Study patients were matched 1:1 with historical controls undergoing similar procedures using traditional anesthetic (non-TJRA) techniques. Matching criteria included age, sex, surgeon, type of procedure, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status (PS) classification. Hospital-based direct costs were collected for each patient and analyzed in standardized inflation-adjusted constant dollars using cost-to-charge ratios, wage indexes, and physician services valued using Medicare reimbursement rates. The estimated mean direct hospital costs were compared between groups, and a subgroup analysis was performed based on ASA PS classification.
A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients undergoing hepatic surgery who received epidural analgesia between June 1995 and September 2003 at our institution. Forty-nine surgical cases had an epidural catheter placed preoperatively. Data were collected included age, weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status; preoperative partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and platelet count (PLT); estimated blood loss (EBL); and volume of hepatic resection.
Anatomic study was performed on 3 cadavers. A 15-mL methylene blue solution was injected at the T10 level and then an additional 5-mL dye injection at L1 level. Fifty patients were included in the study. Patients in group 1 (n = 25) underwent PVB of 2 segments at the T10 and L1 vertebrae levels on the same side as the hernia, whereas patients in group 2 (n = 25) underwent PVB through 4 segments at T10, T11, T12, and L1 on the same side as the hernia. Perioperative propofol/remifentanil consumption, surgery start time, time to perform the block, duration of sensory block, postoperative visual analog scale scores, and complications were evaluated.
This multicenter study enrolled 144 patients, 18 years or older, with scheduled lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to a single 15-mg dose of EREM; the same dose administered 15, 30, or 60 mins after epidural bupivacaine (20 mL 0.25%); or epidural placebo (normal saline) administered 15, 30, or 60 mins after bupivacaine. Postoperatively, fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia was offered for breakthrough pain. Multiple serum samples were analyzed for morphine and morphine metabolites. Safety and efficacy were assessed.
We anesthetized rats with sevoflurane, exposed the sciatic nerves, and injected 0.2 mL of 1% lidocaine or 0.1% bupivacaine, alone or coadministered with 0.625%, 1.25%, 2.5%, or 5% CaCl2 (n = 8-10 per group). We assessed the complete-block time and complete-recovery time of proprioception, motor function, and nocifensive reaction. To elucidate the mechanism of nerve block, we performed electrophysiology experiments in cultured rat GH3 cells. Sciatic nerves were harvested at day 7 and stained with hemotoxylin/eosin.
This is a prospective series of 10 patients who received cervical nerve root injections using ultrasound as the primary imaging tool, with fluoroscopic confirmation. Our radiologic target point was the posterior aspect of the intervertebral foramen just anterior to the superior articular process in the oblique view and at the midsagittal plane of the articular pillars in the anteroposterior (AP) view.
A randomized, side-by-side comparative evaluation of 7 different ultrasound machine models was performed. Sixteen resident physicians without prior ultrasound experience (inexperienced providers) completed a formal evaluation of each machine model after performing a standardized machine configuration and performance checklist. Inexperienced providers and 10 faculty members experienced in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia evaluated the image quality of 2 standardized images acquired from each machine model.
Seventy patients scheduled for hand or forearm surgery were randomly assigned to receive coracoid IBPB using either ultrasound guidance (group U, n = 35), or nerve stimulation (group S, n = 35). Patients were assessed for sensory and motor block every 5 mins after injection of local anesthetic. Onset time, the primary end point, was defined as the time required for complete sensory and motor block. Time required to perform the block, success rate, and time to resolution of motor blockade were also recorded (secondary end points).
Two hundred thirty-two patients were randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block or a transarterial axillary block for upper extremity surgery. Block placement, motor and sensory testing, and block adequacy data were recorded. The subjects were contacted by a blinded research assistant at 2 and 10 days postoperatively to assess for the presence of dysesthesias and pain and to assess patient satisfaction.
One hundred twenty patients were randomly allocated to receive an ultrasound-guided SCB (n = 40), ICB (n = 40), or AXB (n = 40). Performance time (defined as the sum of imaging and needling times) and the number of needle passes were recorded during the performance of the block. Subsequently, a blinded observer recorded the onset time, block-related pain scores, success rate (surgical anesthesia), and the incidence of complications. The main outcome variable was the total anesthesia-related time, defined as the sum of performance and onset times.
Two patients undergoing thoracic surgery procedures received preoperative midthoracic epidural catheters for postoperative analgesia. Following the 3-mL 1.5% lidocaine test dose, a unilateral Horner syndrome was observed. No other signs and symptoms of high epidural blockade were seen, and the Horner syndrome subsequently resolved. After epidurogram confirmation of proper catheter position and at the conclusion of surgery, the epidural was activated with an appropriate bolus and infusion dose without recurrence of the Horner syndrome.
Sprague-Dawley rats between 6 and 14 months old were used to analyse the capacity of the ovary to release 3H-NE recently incorporated under transmural depolarisation in relation to changes in the ovarian follicular population. Morphometric analysis of ovarian follicles and real time PCR for Bcl2 and Bax mRNA were used to assess follicular atresia.
Using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to compare day 5 and day 18 human glandular endometrium obtained by laser capture microdissection, we identified a specific gene, NUDT9 (nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 9). NUDT9 is known to function as a highly specific adenosine diphosphate ribose pyrophosphatase and has been mapped to chromosome 4q22.1. It gives rise to two alternatively spliced messenger RNAs, NUDT9alpha and NUDT9beta, encoding a member of the Nudix hydrolase family. In this study, we purified NUDT9 protein and produced an antibody, which we then used for immunohistochemical studies.
Charts of patients treated between January 2001 and December 2003 at Changhua Christian Hospital were reviewed. Clinical parameters were compared with those from our previous study in the 1980s.
Two hundred normotensive women at 20-28 weeks' gestation were enrolled in the study. All women were asked to collect a 24-hour urine sample. Urinary protein and calcium were measured and expressed as milligrams per 24 hours. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for each test, and cutoff values were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves.
From 2006 to 2007, we recruited 150 pregnant women who received routine GBS culture screening at 35 weeks' gestation with negative results, and who had repeat cultures and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for GBS after 39 weeks' gestation.
This randomized, double-blind study compared two laparotomy techniques. All hysterectomies were performed for benign conditions. Eighty cases were randomly assigned to receive either Pfannenstiel or Maylard incisions. Measured intraoperative variables included volume of blood loss and duration of surgery. Postoperative variables included abdominal distension, postoperative pain, and quality of life.
A double-blind clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effect of calcium supplement therapy on PMS symptoms. The study groups were selected from young female college students, based on PMS criteria. The subjects were divided in two groups; one group received placebo and the other received 500 mg of calcium carbonate twice daily for 3 months. The severity and intensity of symptoms, including early fatigability, changes in appetite, and depression, were evaluated using a standard questionnaire. Symptoms were compared before and after treatment.
Identification of sites vulnerable to mutation is a new trend aimed at extending our knowledge of diseases at the genomic and proteomic levels. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was performed to determine the positions corresponding to specific peptide motifs in the amino acid sequence of the ER. A new computational tool called GlobPlot was used to identify the weak linkage positions within the ER.
The participants included 43 women with symptomatic myomas who wished to retain their uteri. All the women were older than 45 years old, agreed to use the GnRH agonist for menopause induction, and were without any underlying malignancy. They were treated with six courses of GnRH agonist between 2004 and 2005. The definition of re-intervention included: (1) surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, myomectomy or laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion, or (2) modification of GnRH agonist use. Modification of GnRH agonist use included either failure to complete a 6-month GnRH agonist treatment course, or re-use of GnRH agonist with/without interruption of continuity. Failure was defined as women who underwent surgical intervention or failed to complete the 6-month GnRH agonist treatment. Evaluations were performed every 6 months, for up to 2 years.
In this study, new gene ontology technology was used to predict changes in the molecular function and biologic processes caused by the interaction between IRF-1 and HPV E7.
In this pilot study, 60 infertile PCOS patients were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial and divided into three equal groups. Group 1 received 1,000 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D per day, orally. Group 2 received the same as Group 1, plus 1,500 mg/day of metformin. Group 3 received 1,500 mg/day of metformin. The patients were treated for 3 months and followed up for a further 3 months. Regularity of menses, number of large follicles (&gt; or = 14 mm) and pregnancy rates were compared among the three groups.
This prospective, randomized trial was carried out in the IVF center of China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan, from February 1, 2004 to January 30, 2005. A total of 44 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 30 were allocated to acupuncture, and 14 were allocated to no acupuncture. EA was performed four times, twice a week for 2 weeks, from day 2 of the study to the day before oocyte retrieval. After patients felt the needle reaction, the needles were attached to an electrical stimulator for 30 minutes. Clinical pregnancy and pulsatility index (PI) of right and left uterine arteries before and after EA were measured.
Chromosomal karyotyping was performed on samples of chorionic villi, amniotic fluid cells, amniotic membrane, umbilical cord, fetal skin, and placenta from a fetus with elevated nuchal translucency. Polymorphic short tandem repeat markers and Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping chips were used for molecular analyses.
A 32-year-old, gravida 6, woman was a carrier of a balanced translocation 45,XX,der(2),t(2,22), and had a poor obstetric history. Chorionic villus sampling was performed, and the results revealed the fetus to be a balanced translocation carrier, like the mother. Microcephaly was detected during the third trimester and amniocentesis was performed. The results showed a 45,XX,der(2)t(2;22)(q37,q11.2)mat,-22 karyotype. After counseling, the mother elected to undergo pregnancy termination. Feticide was performed before labor induction. However, she experienced discomfort when a minimal amount of potassium chloride (3 mEq) was injected into the fetal heart, without inducing fetal asystole. We, therefore, induced cardiac tamponade using 10 mL of normal saline instilled into the fetal pericardial space. Fetal asystole was noted. The whole procedure was performed without incident, and termination was achieved by hysterotomy after informed consent was given.
A 26-year-old primigravida at 14 weeks' gestation was presented to our outpatient department with a complaint of dysuria. Routine antenatal ultrasound revealed disruption of the fetal upper thoracic vertebral column curvature, together with hemivertebrae. Further high-resolution two-dimensional ultrasound examination revealed dilatation of the thoracolumbar vertebrae and extra echogenic foci in the spinal canal. Thoracolumbar meningocele was also observed. These observations (thoracic hemivertebrae, scoliosis and thoracolumbar meningocele) suggested a diagnosis of type I diastematomyelia. The family was counseled regarding the prognosis for the fetus. Their decision to terminate the pregnancy was considered and approved by the ethical council. The postabortion pathologic examination, along with X-ray, three-dimensional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations, supported the initial diagnosis.
A 20-year-old, primigravida with bilateral malignant ovarian tumors, who received no prior antenatal care, was presented with intestinal obstruction at 5 months' gestation. Pregnancy was preserved, and bilateral oophorectomy, omentectomy with resection of sigmoid colon growth, and colostomy were performed. The patient aborted spontaneously and postoperatively, and was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
Clinical data for five patients with primary malignant melanoma are presented. Diagnosis was based on histologic and immunohistochemical examinations. Case 1 was a 58-year-old woman with mucosal lentiginous melanoma of the vulva. The other four patients, all of whom were over 40 years old, had vaginal melanomas. They were all treated with surgery, and three also received postoperative adjuvant therapy with interferon alpha-2b. Despite this, three of the patients died owing to widespread disease.
Histologic examination revealed the mass to be an Antoni A-dominated tumor that was S-100-positive, CD117-negative, and smooth muscle actin-negative. The patient underwent a total hysterectomy and removal of the tumor, and had no evidence of recurrence at 2 years' follow-up.
Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, single-center, phase-II clinical trial. One hundred and ten chronically HIV-1-infected patients, older than 18 years and na√Øve for antiretroviral therapy (i.e., without prior or current management with antiretroviral drugs) will be enrolled at the outpatient services from the most important centres for health insurance care in Medellin-Colombia. The interventions will be lovastatin (40 mg/day, orally, for 12 months; 55 patients) or placebo (55 patients). Our primary aim will be to determine the effect of lovastatin on viral replication. The secondary aim will be to determine the effect of lovastatin on CD4+ T-cell count in peripheral blood. As tertiary aims we will explore differences in CD8+ T-cell count, expression of activation markers (CD38 and HLA-DR) on CD4 and CD8 T cells, cholesterol metabolism, LFA-1/ICAM-1 function, Rho GTPases function and clinical evolution between treated and not treated HIV-1-infected individuals.
The EVOLVO study is a prospective, randomized, parallel, unblinded, multicenter clinical trial designed to compare remote ICD management with the current standard of care, in order to assess its ability to treat and triage patients more effectively. Two-hundred patients implanted with wireless-transmission-enabled ICD will be enrolled and randomized to receive either the Medtronic CareLink monitor for remote transmission or the conventional method of in-person evaluations. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the design of the trial. The results, which are to be presented separately, will characterize healthcare utilizations as a result of ICD follow-up by means of remote monitoring instead of conventional in-person evaluations.
From September 1999 to February 2006, men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) by one surgeon were given the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index to complete preop, and then annually thereafter to 2 years. We have 285 men who have completed the pre-op and year 1 and /or year 2 surveys. Continence was defined as requiring "no pads" on the survey. Analysis was based on attempted nerve sparing status of the surgery; none, unilateral, or bilateral. Subgroup analysis was then performed on successful nerve sparing surgery, defined as men responding they have an erection "firm enough for intercourse."
A review of English-language literature from 1990 to the present was performed utilizing the U.S. National Library of Medicine's Pub Med database. Keywords used were urothelial cell carcinoma, prostatic urethral involvement, prostatic duct/acini involvement, carcinoma in situ. Bibliographies of reviewed articles were also searched.
We studied 11 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy due to RCCC; from each patient we obtained a sample from the cancer tissue, and another from normal renal tissue. These biopsies were mechanically disaggregated to allow individual cells analysis. Cells were incubated with daunorubicin (a fluorescent drug extruded by P-gp) at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C for 30 min. P-gp activity was analyzed using flow cytometry. Results were expressed as the percentage of cells with P-gp activity (i.e., low fluorescence).
Patients with prostate cancer (n = 287) and other urogenital cancer (n = 126) were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the following time points: at the beginning (T1) and the end (T2) of the treatment in the hospital, 6 months later (T3), and 1 year later (T4).
The in vitro activities of sunitinib and cisplatin alone and in combination were determined against human urothelial carcinoma cell lines, TCC-SUP and 5637. Antitumor activities were also determined in vivo against murine subcutaneous 5637 xenografts. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect VEGFR2 and Kit, and modulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.
Gene expression was analyzed by a real-time quantitative PCR method in paired samples from 14 bladder cancer patients treated with a combination of neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin. The prognostic significance of XAF1 and XIAP mRNA expression as well as the correlation with several clinical and pathological findings were evaluated.
We analyzed genomic DNA samples of 488 prostate cancer cases undergoing brachytherapy at Hannover Medical School, and of 462 male controls from the same location. Genotyping was performed using 5'-exonuclease allelic discrimination assays, and results were evaluated with chi(2) tests and logistic regression analyses.
Thirty-seven patients subjected to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were divided into 2 groups for the analyses: Low (&lt; or =6-18) and high (&gt; or =7-19) Gleason score and tumor behavior; recurrence 15 and nonrecurrence 22, mean follow-up 52.6 months.
Cross-sectional study.
Children aged 6-59 months who were admitted to Vaiola Hospital, Nuku'alofa, Tonga, and had blood collected for clinical investigation, were tested for HBsAg with a rapid serological test (Abbott Determine). A total of 449 children were recruited and interviewed and 375 (84%) were tested for HBsAg. Convenience testing was chosen, as it was likely to be a relatively unbiased method in this situation where all children on the island have good and equitable access to hospital services. Immunization status was checked against the children's immunization cards and cross-checked against the records kept by the public health nurses. Information about socio-economic status, parent education, blood transfusion, breast-feeding, mode of delivery, and place of birth was collected through interviews with mothers using a standardized questionnaire.
Case series.
Warmblood horses (n=23) and 2 ponies.
Medical records (1999-2008) of equids with pelvic or coxofemoral disorders that had pelvic radiography and ultrasonography were retrieved and results of both techniques compared.
Case series.
Horses (n=5) with ventral median abdominal incisional hernia.
A telescope and 2 instrument portals were established bilaterally, lateral to and distant from the hernia margins. After exposure of the internal rectus sheath by removal of retroperitoneal fat with endoscopic scissors and monopolar cautery, a prosthetic mesh was introduced into the abdomen and secured intraperitoneally using transfascial sutures with or without supplemental endoscopic hernia fixation devices.
Case series.
Cats (n=21) with ilial fractures.
Medical records (June 1994 to February 2004) and radiographs were reviewed. Retrieved data were: signalment, fracture description, screw purchase, screw loosening, complications, and clinical outcome. Sacral index (SI) was used to objectively assess degree of pelvic canal narrowing. Long-term follow-up was by owner telephone interview or postal questionnaire.
Prospective study.
Cats (n=10) with iliac fractures.
Cats with ilial fractures (January 2005-December 2006) were treated by application of a dorsally applied bone plate. Immediate postoperative radiographs were compared with those taken 4-6 weeks later to assess screw loosening, screw purchase, and pelvic canal narrowing. Owners were contacted for medium-term (&gt;3 month) follow-up. Data were compared with a report of outcome after lateral plating (LP) in 21 cats.
Anatomic study.
Frozen cadaveric feline sacra.
Feline sacra (n=20) were used to perform a radiographic study to define a safe corridor to a depth of 66% of the sacral body width. Two drill start points (A and B) were evaluated. Dorsal exit from the safe corridor was considered unacceptable.
Case series.
Cats (3) and dogs (2) with ear canal separation.
Medical records (1998-2007) of dogs and cats with ear canal separation were reviewed. Long-term outcome was obtained by telephone interview of owners or referring veterinarians.
Case series.
TPLO (n=168) on 142 dogs.
Medical records (January 2006-September 2007) and radiographs of all dogs that had TPLO were reviewed. Data retrieved were breed, sex, age, weight, type of plate, use of a jig, time to recheck, preoperative tibial plateau angle (TPA), immediate postoperative TPA, and presence or absence of fibular fracture.
Clinical report.
Dogs (n=6) idiopathic chylothorax.
Ultrasonography was used to guide percutaneous injection of intestinal lymph nodes with nonionic iodinated contrast medium for preoperative CT lymphography of the thoracic duct in 6 dogs with chylothorax. Thoracic CT images were acquired immediately after contrast medium injection. All dogs had subtotal pericardectomy and thoracic duct ligation. Postoperative thoracic duct lymphography was performed in 3 dogs. Superficial cervical lymph node lymphography was performed in 2 dogs to determine cervical lymphatic contribution to thoracic effusions.
Case series.
Horses (n=233) aged &gt; or =1 year that had exploratory celiotomy for small intestinal disease that recovered from surgery from 1995 to 2005.
Sixty-eight variables were collected from medical records (1995-2005) for each horse. POI was defined as nasogastric reflux volume &gt;20 L over 24 hours or &gt;8 L at any single time after surgery.
Experimental ex vivo study.
Cadaveric equine thoracic limb pairs (n=10).
Insertion of a 4.5 mm cortex screw in lag fashion into an intact distal phalanx was evaluated in 2 groups (n=10) of cadaveric equine thoracic limbs. In 1 group, the site, direction, and length of the implant were determined by radiography, and in the other group, by CT. Accuracy of screw placement was verified by specimen dissection. Outcomes were (1) absence of penetration of the articular surface, the solar surface, or the semilunar canal (2) appropriate length and direction of the screw. Surgical time was also measured.
Case series.
Dogs (n=24) with ST.
Medical records (1995-2006) of dogs with ST that had surgical treatment were reviewed. Results of clinical examination, diagnostic imaging, surgery, histopathology of resected tendon tissue, and outcome were compared between dogs with mineralized and nonmineralized ST.
Experimental study.
Adult female Beagle dogs (n=12).
Non-simultaneous and bilateral transverse mid-diaphyseal osteotomies performed in tibiae were stabilized and distracted by a Type Ia external skeletal fixation device. After a latency period of 5 days, distraction was applied at a rate of 0.5 mm every 12 hours for 10 days. Then, the external fixator was maintained in a static mode during the consolidation period until bone healing or euthanasia at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 18 weeks after operations, whichever came first. Distracted regions were isolated and their structure was examined by BS-SEM.
Retrospective cohort study.
OFA radiographic classifications (n=431,483) on dogs whelped between 1989 and 2003.
Numbers and percentages of dogs classified by hip joint phenotypes were determined for 2-year cohorts. Differences between breeds and sexes were assessed using the Fisher's exact test, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to express associations. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was calculated to identify significant trends over time.
Experimental study.
Healthy female goats (n=9); aged, 10-18 months; weighing, 22-30 kg.
Food was withheld for 24 hours and water for 10 hours. Anesthetized right laterally recumbent goats had a laparoscopic portal and 3 instrumental portals created in the left flank. Splenic attachments were dissected with monopolar electrocautery and blunt dissection through 2 instrument portals. Exposure and isolation of splenic vessels was performed with laparoscopic "right-angle" preparation forceps. Vessels were ligated with a medium-titanium clip and 2 silk sutures and then transected between the silk sutures. The detached spleen was manipulated into a specimen retrieval bag, morcellated, and the bag retrieved through an enlarged portal. Repeat laparoscopic examination was performed at 1 month.
Case series.
Dogs (n=9) and cats (6).
Medical records (January 2004-January 2008) of dogs and cats that had tube cystostomy via an inguinal approach were reviewed. Retrieved data included signalment, diagnosis, surgical technique, and complications. Access to the bladder was through a muscle splitting approach in the inguinal region with the cystostomy tube placed through a skin incision made several centimeters proximal to this incision and secured in the bladder by a purse string suture. Cystopexy during closure of the muscle layers ensured secure closure and minimized the likelihood of uroabdomen if tube dislodgment occurred.
Clinical case report.
An 11-year-old, female neutered, Labrador Retriever.
The dog was referred for clinical signs of bowel obstruction. An enterectomy was performed 2 years before presentation using a CEEA stapling device. Palpation, plain radiographs, and ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a mass in the bowel, causing obstruction, and requiring surgical approach.
Clinical case report.
Five-year-old female alpaca.
Grade IV/IV lateral, left patella luxation and mild femoropatellar joint effusion was identified by palpation and visual assessment, and confirmed by ultrasonography and radiographs. Trochlear block recession combined with lateral retinacular release and medial imbrication to restore patella function.
Preclinical research study.
Skeletally mature, male Hounds (25-30 kg; n=24) with no preexisting joint pathology.
Dogs had unilateral cemented TKR and were evaluated at 6, 12, 26, or 52 weeks (6 dogs/time point) by radiography, bone density analysis, visual gait assessment, and direct measurement of thigh circumference and stifle joint range of motion as indicators of functional recovery. At study end, the stability of the cemented tibial component was determined by destructive mechanical testing.
Prospective clinical case study.
Dogs (n=6) with severe stifle OA.
Preoperative and postoperative evaluations were compared after 6 dogs had TKR. Data gathered included radiographs, goniometric measures of passive range of motion, ground reaction forces, and girth measurements of the thigh before surgery and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.
Case report.
An 18-month-old, 47 kg alpaca male.
Cementless THR was performed in an alpaca with a chronic, right SCFE, and secondary osteoarthritis. Force plate gait analysis was performed before and 8 weeks after surgery. Outcome was determined through clinical evaluation, radiography, and force plate gait analysis.
Prospective study.
Cadaveric canine stifles (n=10); Client-owned dogs (15).
In cadaveric stifles, the femoropatellar space was assessed before placement of a joint distractor and examination of the femorotibial joint. Time to complete evaluation of the femoropatellar space, to observe the cruciate ligaments, and to completion of examination of the femorotibial joint were recorded. Distractor-assisted arthroscopy was then performed in 15 consecutive clinical cases. Clinical information, time to complete joint evaluation, and ability to perform any additional arthroscopic surgery were recorded.
Case series.
Dogs &gt;or=20 kg with suspected cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) deficiency.
A custom designed linear side bar was constructed to allow invasive pin distraction of the stifle joint. Its design efficacy for distraction of the medial joint compartment, observation and probing of the medial meniscus, and value during meniscal surgery was evaluated by clinical use.
Descriptive study.
Cadaveric equine skulls (n=11); 8 horses with a history of quidding or headshaking.
Tangential radiographic projections were taken of a TMJ of a cadaveric skull before and after intra-articular injection of radiographic contrast. Additional tangential radiographic projections were taken after TMJ dissection and placement of a wire along the articular surface of the mandibular condyle. Subsequently, 3 tangential radiographs were taken of both TMJs of 10 skulls at 75 degrees , 70 degrees , and 65 degrees to the dorsal plane (Rt/Le15Cd70D-Le/RtRVO). Each of the 3 images for each TMJ was ranked by 4 observers who were unaware of the projection angle. Interobserver variation was calculated using a Friedman analysis of variance and significance of the most prevalent angle with a 1-sample repeated measures test. Tangential radiographic projections of both TMJs were then taken of 8 standing sedated horses.
Descriptive study
Cadaveric equine heads (n=40)
The VCS and RMS were examined endoscopically using: (1) rostral trephination of the RMS (rostral RMS approach); (2) caudal trephination of the RMS (caudal RMS approach); (3) conchofrontal sinus (CFS) trephination followed by RMS trephination at a site identified by endoscopic transillumination of the maxillary bone at the most rostral aspect of the caudal maxillary sinus (CMS) (light-indicated RMS approach); (4) CFS trephination with fenestration of the ventral conchal bulla (VCB; frontal VCB approach); (5) CMS trephination with VCB fenestration (caudal VCB approach); and (6) CFS and CMS trephination with VCB fenestration (combined VCB approach).
Case series
Horses (n=60) with suspected paranasal sinus disease.
Horses were evaluated by sinoscopy through a conchofrontal sinus (CFS) portal with ventral conchal bulla (VCB) fenestration. Other endoscopic sinus approaches and adjunctive diagnostic tests; oral examination, computed tomography, radiography, scintigraphy and endoscopic examination of the upper portion of the respiratory tract were used in some horses.
Clinical report.
A 2-year-old Warmblood stallion.
A metallic foreign body was removed from a talocrural joint using a 10-mm magnetic retriever under arthroscopic guidance. Preoperative radiographs were used to locate the intra-articular position of the foreign body.
Case series.
Foals (n=40) aged 5-180 days.
Clinical signs, laboratory data, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, surgical procedures, medical treatment, and necropsy findings were retrieved from medical records. Outcome was obtained by reviewing performance, sales, and produce records or by telephone conversations with the owners.
Clinical report.
Cat with DCRV.
DCRV was diagnosed in a 5-month-old male Maine Coon cat using echocardiography and angiocardiography. At 2 years, despite medical therapy, chylothorax developed. A section of the right ventricular free wall that spanned the fibromuscular obstruction was excised under total venous inflow occlusion (TVIO) using the incised pericardial patch technique.
Cadaveric study.
Medium to large breed dog cadavers (n=10; 20 pelvic limbs).
TPLO was performed using the currently recommended technique involving dissection of the proximal tibial soft tissue envelope and its protection using cotton gauze sponges. In paired limbs, the procedure was repeated but no attempt was made to retract and protect the proximal tibial soft tissue envelope. Damage to the soft tissue envelope and presence of gross particulate cotton debris were investigated by direct observation and photographic analysis. Presence of microscopic cotton debris was investigated using light microscopic analysis of wound lavage fluid.
Case report.
A 2-year-old male Pug.
MMM was diagnosed in a Pug with a 2-week history of trismus by electrodiagnostics, histopathology, and 2M antibody test. During anesthesia tongue protrusion occurred and because of trismus, an inability to reposition the tongue resulted in venous congestion and severe swelling. Forceful physical attempts and subsequent removal of the rostral digastricus and masseter muscle attachments from the mandible did not increase jaw mobility. Mandibular symphysiotomy was necessary to resolve lingual venous congestion and to reposition the tongue into the oral cavity.
Case report.
A 5-month-old male foal.

Between January 1, 2003 and December 30, 2005, 15 consecutive newborn infants with IVH grades III to IV, complicated with progressive ventricular dilatation, underwent placement of an Ommaya reservoir. CSF was intermittently aspirated percutaneously from the reservoir. The amount and frequency of CSF aspiration were based on the clinical presentation and the follow-up results of serial cranial ultrasonograms or CT scans. The changes of CSF cell counts and chemistries were also followed. Patients whose progressive ventricular dilatation persisted despite serial CSF aspiration through Ommaya reservoir eventually had ventriculo-peritoneal shunts (V-P shunt) placed. All the patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic after discharge from the hospital and the neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated through 18-36 months of age.
Random cluster sampling was used. The fourth national growth survey of children under 7 years in the nine cities (Beijing, Harbin, Xi'an, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Guangzhou and Kunming) of China was performed in 2005 and from this survey, data of 69 760 urban healthy boys and girls were used to set up the database for weight-for-age, height-for-age (length was measured for children under 3 years) and head circumference-for-age. Anthropometric data were ascribed to rigorous methods of data collection and standardized procedures across study sites. LMS method based on BOX-COX normal transformation and cubic splines smoothing technique was chosen for fitting the raw data according to study design and data features, and standardized values of any percentile and standard deviation were obtained by the special formulation of L, M and S parameters. Length-for-age and height-for-age standards were constructed by fitting the same model but the final curves reflected the 0.7 cm average difference between these two measurements. A set of systematic diagnostic tools was used to detect possible biases in estimated percentiles or standard deviation curves, including chi2 test, which was used for reference to evaluate to the goodness of fit.

Eighty newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into hyperoxia and normoxia control groups, then each group was further divided into 4, 7, 10, 14 and 20 days subgroups. Beginning on day 1 of life, 40 rats in hyperoxia group were exposed to hyperoxia [(75+/-2)% O2] for 7 days, and subsequently were moved into room air, thus ROP model was set up. An additional 40 rats were raised in room air served as age matched controls. Rats of postnatal day4 (d 4), d 7, d 10, d 14 and d 20 were sacrificed respectively. Rats left eyes were obtained, the anterior half of the eyeball and the vitreous were removed, then the retinae were gently scraped off the choroid, and used to delineate retinal vascular development by adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase) staining. Right eyes were embedded in paraffin and frozen sections were stained with immunohistochemistry to measure the expression of ang-2 in the retinae. Meanwhile, the number of new vascular cell nuclei extending into the internal limiting membrane in cross-sections was counted after HE staining to assess retinal neovascularization.
Preterm infants (birth weight 1000-2000 g) recruited into the study were randomized into three groups.

Following a defined surgical curriculum, fellow-attending pairs operated on female hogs. A predetermined dataset was collected for each procedure.
The sample consisted of 16 maxillary first premolars from 8 patients who required bilateral extractions as part of their orthodontic treatment. In each subject, a fixed experimental appliance was placed on the maxillary teeth on each side, allowing a buccally directed force. The force was generated by a segmental wire of beta-titanium-molybdenum alloy. The first premolar on 1 side received a buccally directed continuous force, and the contralateral premolar received intermittent force. The initial force magnitude for both sides was 225 cN. After 14 days of initial continuous force, the intermittent force application was obtained with subsequently repeated periods until the end of the eighth week of a 3-day rest period followed by a 4-day force application period. Force levels were set to 225 cN at each patient visit. After the experimental period of 8 weeks, the teeth were extracted under a strict protocol to prevent root surface damage and analyzed with a microcomputed-tomography scan system, and specially designed software was used for direct volumetric measurements.
Nineteen adult patients with severe skeletal Class III malocclusion (Class III group) and 20 adults with normal occlusion (control group) participated in this study.

Two materials were tested, each in 2 thicknesses: Erkodur (Erkodent Erich Kopp GmbH, Pfalzgrafenweiler, Germany) 1.0 and 0.8 mm, and Biolon (Dreve Dentamid GmbH, Unna, Germany), 1.0 and 0.75 mm. For each material, 5 appliances were produced. To measure the forces applied, an isolated measuring tooth, part of a standardized resin model, was deflected in 0.05 degrees steps from 0 degrees to 0.42 degrees in the vestibular and palatine directions, after placing the respective appliance on the model. For statistical analysis, the force components Fx/tipping and Fz/intrusion at a displacement of +/- 0.151 mm from the incisor edge were selected. Means and standard deviations were calculated. The Wilcoxon 2-sample test for group pairings was used.
Two stainless steel models were designed and manufactured simulating flat and convex maxillary right buccal dental arches. Five stainless steel brackets from the maxillary incisor to the second premolar (slot size, 0.22 in, Victory, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) and a first molar tube were aligned and clamped on the metal model at equal distances of 6 mm. Four kinds of orthodontic wires were tested: (1) A. J. Wilcock Australian wire (0.016 in, G&amp;H Wire, Hannover, Germany); and (2) 0.016 x 0.022 in, (3) 0.018 x 0.022 in, and (4) 0.019 x 0.025 in (3M Unitek GmbH, Seefeld, Germany). Gray elastomeric modules (Power O 110, Ormco, Glendora, Calif) were used for ligation. Friction tests were performed in the wet state with artificial saliva lubrication and by pulling 5 mm of the whole length of the archwire. Six measurements were made from each bracket-wire combination, and each test was performed with new combinations of materials for both arch setups (n = 48, 6 per group) in a universal testing machine (crosshead speed: 20 mm/min).
Two sets of 25 alginate impressions were taken of patients who had a permanent Class I crowded dentition. Each impression was made into a plaster cast and a 3-dimensional virtual orthodontic model (OrthoCad, Cadent, Fairview, NJ). Measurements of tooth widths at their greatest mesiodistal dimension and arch length were recorded for both types of models. Tooth widths were measured on the plaster models with a digital caliper, and arch length was measured with a piece of brass wire and a millimeter ruler. The virtual models were measured by using OrthoCad's dedicated software. The space analysis measurements were calculated for both types of models, and the extrapolated amount of crowding for each type of model was accessed. All measurements were made by 2 examiners. The resulting values were compared with nonparametric statistics, and method errors were calculated.
Seventeen landmarks were identified on the skull. CBCT scans were then obtained, with 2 skull orientations during scanning. Twenty-nine interlandmark linear measurements were made directly on the skull and compared with the same measurements made on the CBCT scans. All measurements were made by 2 operators on 4 separate occasions.
Thirty human skulls were scanned with dental CBCT, and 3-dimensional reconstructions of the dentitions were generated. Ten measurements (overbite, overjet, maxillary and mandibular intermolar and intercanine widths, arch length available, and arch length required) were made directly on the dentitions of the skulls with a high-precision digital caliper and on the digital reconstructions with commercially available software. Reliability and accuracy were assessed by using intraclass correlation and paired Student t tests. A P value of &lt; or = 0.05 was used to assign statistical significance.
Ninety-seven titanium surgical miniscrews (diameter, 1.2 mm; length, 8-12 mm) were placed in the maxilla of 49 patients, at either a high level (nonkeratinized area) or a medium level (mucogingival junction), with the 1-stage or the 2-stage surgical technique. Survival time, event of each screw (survival or failure), and 7 clinical parameters were gathered for survival analysis. Age and latency factors were analyzed with t tests.
Mandibular asymmetry index measurements (condylar, ramal, and condylar-plus-ramal) were made on the panoramic radiographs of 126 subjects (51 boys, 75 girls). The study groups consisted of 46 unilateral (19 boys, 27 girls; mean age, 13.06 +/- 3.52 years) and 40 bilateral (16 boys, 24 girls; mean age, 12.72 +/- 3.22 years) posterior crossbite patients and a group of 40 subjects (16 boys, 24 girls; mean age, 14.43 +/- 3.05 years) with normal occlusion. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine possible statistically significant differences between the groups for condylar, ramal, and condylar-plus-ramal asymmetry index measurements at the 95% confidence interval.
We screened 133 patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusions. The subjects were divided into 3 bite-jumping groups: I, 49 subjects with bite jumping of &lt;7 mm; II, 44 subjects with bite jumping of 7.5 to 9.5 mm; and III, 40 subjects with bite jumping of &gt;9.5 mm. Only group I with small (S) and group III with large (L) bite jumping were considered. The average ages of the subjects in the 2 bite-jumping groups were 13.6 +/- 2.4 years in the S group and 14.7 +/- 4.7 years in the L group. The average treatment time with the Herbst/MB appliance was 19 months. Lateral headfilms were evaluated at 3 times: before Herbst treatment, after Herbst treatment, and after MB treatment.

The objective of this study was to establish a relationship between IGF-1 levels collected from blood-spot samples and hand-wrist radiographs at various skeletal stages. Eighty-four subjects (45 female, 39 male) between the ages of 5 and 25 were included in the study. Each subject had personal information, a hand-wrist radiograph, and a blood-spot sample collected on the same day.
During phase 1 treatment, 86 subjects were treated with a bionator, 93 were treated with headgear/biteplane, and 81 served as the observation group. For phase 2, all subjects were then treated with full orthodontic appliances. Arch dimensions were followed; maxillary and mandibular alginate impressions were taken at baseline, end of early Class II treatment or observation, beginning of fixed appliance treatment, end of orthodontic treatment, and approximately 3 years posttreatment. Alginate impressions were taken of each dental arch at each data collection point. These were poured in orthodontic stone, trimmed, and photocopied from the occlusal aspect. These images were then scanned and measured.
Fifteen rats were divided into 3 groups. Group I was the untreated controls; group II received a clear plastic appliance made from a model, with the maxillary left first molar repositioned mesially 0.5 mm from the origin; and group III had a closed-coil spring to move the molar mesially. Specimens were prepared in parasagittal sections, and changes in paradental tissues were evaluated on days 1, 4, and 7 by light microscopy.
Bovine teeth were stored in 6 storage media for 7 months before bonding: dry (no medium), filtered water, 10% formalin, 1% chloramine T, 10% chloramine T, isotonic saline solution, and 70% ethanol. These teeth were further subdivided into 2 groups; 1 group was rinsed with oil-free air and water spray before bonding orthodontic brackets, and the other group not rinsed. All specimens were tested in the shear-peel mode to failure.
Ten patients with bone markers placed in the maxilla and the mandible had their canines retracted over a 2-month period. Retraction was accomplished with beta-titanium alloy T-loop springs. Standardized 45 degrees oblique cephalograms where taken initially and every 28 days thereafter. The radiographs were scanned and digitized twice (the average was used for the analyses). The radiographs were superimposed by using the bone markers and oriented on the functional occlusal plane. Paired t tests were used to compare side and jaw effects.
Cone-beam computed tomography scans were taken before and after Class III malocclusion orthopedic treatment with miniplates. Three observers independently constructed 18 3D virtual surface models from cone-beam computed tomography scans of 3 patients. Separate 3D models were constructed for soft-tissue, cranial base, maxillary, and mandibular surfaces. The anterior cranial fossa was used to register the 3D models of before and after treatment (about 1 year of follow-up).
Three sets, each consisting of a maxillary and a mandibular appliance, of as-received aligners were immersed in normal saline solution for 2 months. Samples of eluents were diluted to 3 concentrations (5%, 10%, and 20% vol/vol) and tested for cytotoxicity on human gingival fibroblasts and estrogenicity by measuring their effect on the proliferation of the estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. All assays were repeated 4 times for each maxillary and mandibular set, and the results were analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appliance and concentration serving as predictors at the .05 level of significance; differences among groups were investigated with the Tukey test.
Thirty dry skulls were imaged with cone-beam computed tomography technology. Coronal slices were generated on which overall bone depth and cortical bone thickness were measured at 4 levels and 34 palatal placement sites. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for data analysis.
A total of 40 undergraduate students were divided into 2 groups. Group A was taught according to the conventional teaching method of theory and practical classes, and group B was taught with an LVO. The students' learning performance was tested by using a multiple-choice questionnaire that covered the knowledge and understanding of cephalometry and by the index of correct landmark identification. The Student t test was used to check statistical differences between the 2 groups. LVO usability was evaluated with a questionnaire based on the system usability scale.
In 38 stable patients with CF and 20 matched control subjects, we measured fat-free mass (FFM), inspiratory muscle strength, diaphragm thickness, quadriceps and biceps strength and cross-sectional area, and circulating levels of leukocytes, C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha soluble receptors, and immunoglobulin G.
RNA was extracted from 23 stable IPF lungs, 8 IPF lungs with acute exacerbation (IPF-AEx), and 15 control lungs and used for hybridization on Agilent gene expression microarrays. Functional analysis of genes was performed with Spotfire and Genomica. Gene validations for MMP1, MMP7, AGER, DEFA1-3, COL1A2, and CCNA2 were performed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling assays were performed on the same tissues used for the microarray. ELISA for alpha-defensins was performed on plasma from control subjects, patients with stable IPF, and patients with IPF-AEx.
Fifty-seven infants (median age, 3.6 mo) with CF underwent bronchoalveolar lavage and chest computed tomography (CT) using a three-slice inspiratory and expiratory protocol.
This study was a population-based, case-control study. Cases were adults 18 to 27 years of age who were hospitalized for a respiratory illness from 1998 to 2007 within Washington State who could be linked to a Washington State birth certificate for the years 1980 to 1988. Four control subjects, frequency matched by birth year, were randomly selected from Washington State birth certificates for each case patient. Control subjects who died before age 18 were excluded.

AECs were obtained from subjects with asthma (n = 8) and normal subjects without asthma (n = 10). Monolayer and air-liquid interface-AEC (ALI-AEC) cultures were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (10 ng/ml) for 72 hours and assayed for mesenchymal and epithelial markers using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, confocal microscopy, and immunoblot. The involvement of BMP-7, Smad3, and MAPK-mediated signaling were also evaluated.
PMN were isolated from sputum and blood of subjects with and without CF or non-CF bronchiectasis for phagocytic assays. HNP isolated from patients with CF were used to stimulate healthy PMN followed by phagocytic tests.
We included data from the 1996 to 2002 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, a biennial nationally representative survey. We studied respondents who completed cognitive testing in 1996 and at least one subsequent survey, and excluded those with unknown history of COPD. Clinical history of COPD was based on self-report; severity was categorized based on use of oxygen or disease-related activity limitations. Our primary outcome was cognitive performance, measured using a validated 35-point scale. We examined the effect of COPD on cognition using multivariable mixed linear models accounting for repeated measurements, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
From infected airways of six patients with CF, 25 P. aeruginosa clones were isolated during a period of up to 16.3 years and genotypically and phenotypically characterized. Virulence of the 8 early, 6 intermediate, and 11 late CF isolates and 5 environmental strains was assessed by monitoring acute mortality versus survival and P. aeruginosa chronic persistence versus lung clearance in mice of different genetic backgrounds, including CF mice.

An occupational hygienist and a field scientist visited the two UK suppliers and 20 out of the 25 workplaces known to be using MbOCA in the UK during 2005 and 2006. They collected air samples, surface wipes, gloves, and urine samples and made observations to assess exposure and the adequacy of controls. All samples were analysed for MbOCA and urine samples were additionally analysed for isocyanate metabolites. A statistical analysis was made of the results.
In this paper, we propose a general framework of sampling strategies on sample size requirement together with the number of repeated measurements using the mixed-effects generalized linear model (GLM). As illustrative examples, we discuss sampling strategies separately under the log-normal assumption for hypotheses testing on (i) mean exposure differences of multiple worker groups and (ii) presence of a long-term exposure trend.
A total of 408 patients (221 treatment-naive) treated with pegylated interferon-alpha2b and ribavirin were included. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was measured at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. RVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 4 weeks and EVR as &gt;/=2 log(10) decrease in HCV RNA at 12 weeks. The additive value of RVR on predicting sustained virological response (SVR) was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
A total of 25 patients with chronic HCV infection were enrolled in this study. All patients received ribavirin for 4 weeks during monotherapy; subsequently, interferon-alpha2b was additionally given as combined therapy. Patients were divided into two groups according to virological response. A rapid viral responder (RVR) was defined as a patient in whom HCV RNA became undetectable within 4 weeks after combination therapy. The changes of the T-helper (Th)1/Th2 subset of peripheral blood CD4(+) T-cells, serum cytokine levels and the alignment of the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) during ribavirin monotherapy were analysed by flow cytometry, ELISAs and sequencing methods.
This was an observational cohort. Genotypic resistance testing was performed on treatment-naive individuals and those failing first-line ART (confirmed HIV-1 RNA&gt;1,000 copies/ml) from public sector clinics in Cape Town (2002-2007). Resistance profiles and mutations relative to timing of known virological failure were examined.

We included patients infected between 1996 and 2006, with a plasma sample obtained &lt;18 months after seroconversion and prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation. Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were determined by direct population sequencing from plasma samples. Genotypic resistance was interpreted with the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les H√©patites Virales 2006 algorithm and International AIDS Society-USA list. Phylogenetic analysis (neighbour-joining and maximum likelihood methods) of RT sequences was used to determine the HIV-1 subtype and the interrelationship between sequences.
A total of 60 3TC-experienced patients were treated with (or switched to) ADV monotherapy (30 patients) or ADV+3TC combination therapy (30 patients), and followed for at least 12 months.

ENF resistance mutations in HR1 were introduced or back-mutated in representative clones to evaluate their phenotypic effect in different genetic contexts.
HIV type-1-infected children aged 6 months to 18 years, who were virologically suppressed on an LPV/r-containing regimen, were eligible. Treatment 1 consisted of once-daily LPV/r 460/115 mg/m(2), plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Treatment 2 consisted of twice-daily LPV/r 230/57.5 mg/m(2) plus two NRTIs. Patients were randomized either to start with treatment 1 followed by treatment 2 or vice versa. Full pharmacokinetic profiles were analysed for lopinavir and ritonavir with a validated HPLC tandem mass spectrometry assay.
All cases of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]#&gt;10/h) diagnosed using overnight polysomnography during the period 2004 to 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Those cases in which the ratio of AHI during REM sleep to AHI during non-REM sleep was more than 2 were classified as REM-specific SDB. We recorded the following data: clinical signs and symptoms related to SAHS, PSG results, cardiovascular risk factors, and previous cardiovascular events. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of REM-specific SDB and to analyze the possible interactions between variables.
From March 1993 through December 2007, we studied 1277 patients, of whom 150 (137 men and 13 women; age range, 28-81 years) presented tumors classified as cT3 because of chest wall invasion on the basis of imaging studies.
All patients diagnosed with emphysema who underwent lung transplantation between March 1997 and June 2008 were included. The association between different study variables and early death and death at 1 year and 5 years was studied. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival. A logistic regression model was used to study the association between early death and variables with a trend towards significance (P&lt;.2) in the univariate analysis. The risk factors for mortality at 1 year and 5 years were analyzed by a Cox regression model.
We measured forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), FEV(1)/FVC, residual volume, total lung capacity, DLCO, carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO) and standard anthropometric parameters in 28 patients with a FEV(1)/FVC ratio of &lt;70%.

Conventional colonoscopy was performed in the same day, without previous knowledge of the computed tomographic colonography diagnostics. The study evaluated the capacity of computed tomographic colonography to detect patients with colorectal polyps and identify each colorectal lesion described by the colonoscopy.
After colonoscopy, the individuals were distributed into two groups: patients with colon adenomas (cases) and patients whose colons were normal (controls). The groups were similar regarding age and gender. The individuals of both groups were subjected to a dosage of IgG antibody against H. pylori. The dosage was applied according to the solid phase, chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The chi-square test was used to analyze the data.
In a prospective study, 111 patients who presented smooth mucosa without enanthema in the endoscopic exam of the terminal ileum were selected. Biopsies of the ileal mucosa of such patients were performed, being the slides routinely examined and reviewed afterwards.
A total of 2,177 consecutive colonoscopies were analyzed and 105 images were chosen for analysis, divided into 37 hyperplastic lesions, 42 adenomas and 26 carcinomas. Specific digital morphometry was used, to measure the diameter and area of the pits from hyperplastic lesions, adenomatous and carcinomatous lesions, always comparing them with the normal mucosa surrounding pits.
Seventy five patients with 157 colorectal lesions were prospectively evaluated. The capillary pattern, as well as the pit pattern according to the Kudo classification, of colorectal lesions were evaluated by means of the FICE system. Absence and presence of meshed capillary networks were labeled as non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, respectively. Afterwards, indigo carmine 0.8% was instilled and a new evaluation of the pit pattern was carried out.
Specimens from 40 patients with GIST were assessed for immunohistochemical expression of Ki67 and p53. The tumors were divided according the risk of recurrence in two groups: I with high or intermediate risk and; II with low or very low risk.

The significance level adopted was 5%.
The study was cross-sectional, prospective and descriptive, including 45 patients (16 months-16.9 years) who had undergone Nissen fundoplication in a school hospital. Twenty six patients (57.8%) were neurologically impaired. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in order to determine fundoplication integrity, endoscopic and histopathological esophageal condition. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed from 12 up to 30 months after surgery.
Defecation data of 57 children aged 6.0-40.7 mo were obtained by maternal recall (questionnaire on predominant stool characteristics) and by record (1,934 defecations registered prospectively at home and in the nursery). The bowel habit was classified according to stool frequency and proportion of stool characteristics (soft, hard and/or runny). Two criteria were used to classify recorded data, since the cutoff point for hard stools to identify constipation is undefined in children: predominant criterion and adult criterion, respectively with &gt;50% and &gt;25% of stools with altered consistency. Bowel habit categories were: adequate, constipation, functional diarrhea and 'other bowel habit'. Nonparametric statistics, and the Kappa index for agreement between recalled and recorded bowel habit, were used.

Semiotics provides a theoretical frame for the interdisciplinary analysis of research on cultural competency, especially regarding recent studies on "cultural intelligence", performance and creativity.
Regular whole tribe gatherings 'in the circle' combined with mentoring 'aunties and uncles'. By sharing stories and giving personal feedback on their progress, participants developed skills and confidence in self expression. Relating to each other and the group, and sharing creative expressions (group craft activities, dancing, small group performing) added depth to the experience of participants. Stories and celebrations were filmed, along with meetings to discuss progress and reflect on how to improve our process of sharing together. Ways for individuals to work on improving their life experiences were shared across the group, which generated a combination of forms of inquiry: supportive, collaborative and appreciative. These were combined with reflexive qualitative ethnographic recording by the researcher, to report and reflect on the whole process.

In the present study, Polygonatum odoratum lectin (designated POL), a mannose-binding specific GNA-related lectin, possessed a remarkable antiproliferative activity toward murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells. And, this lectin induced L929 cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. In addition, POL treatment increased the levels of FasL and Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD) proteins and resulted in caspase-8 activation. Also, POL treatment caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential collapse and cytochrome c release, leading to activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Moreover, POL treatment enhanced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced L929 cell apoptosis.

Human mitral posterior leaflets (control, n=6-9; myxomatous, n=14-21; mean age, 61 years for all groups) were histochemically stained for proteoglycan core proteins, hyaluronan, and the hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis. Stain intensity was semiquantitatively graded to determine differences in marker abundance between normal and myxomatous valves. The proteoglycans were localized to different regions of the leaflet by correspondence to parallel Movat-stained sections.
Among 155 cases of IE encountered in a 14-year period, we selected nine cases that had isolated PVIE for analysis. The clinical records were reviewed for the patient demographics, presence or absence of underlying cardiac disease or other predisposing factors, and modes of presentation; these were correlated with the relevant investigations. A detailed study of the heart was done in all with special attention to the pulmonary valve morphology.
In a total of 12 cases, eight females and four males, ranging in age from 39 gestational weeks to 93 postnatal days, dying suddenly and unexpectedly, a fibromuscular hyperplasia of the pulmonary artery was detected. Postmortem examinations were requested with a clinical SIDS or sudden unexpected perinatal death. A complete autopsy was performed, including close examination of the brainstem and cardiac conduction system.
Left ventricular apical core tissues from 29 sequential subjects who received a HeartMate II continuous axial flow left ventricular assist device were studied retrospectively to determine whether interstitial fibrosis, replacement fibrosis (scar), the presence of mural thrombus, or other histopathologic findings were associated with hemodynamic changes or mortality in this population. Patients received left ventricular assist devices as bridges to transplantation or as destination therapy. Interstitial fibrosis was determined by observer scoring and digital scoring methods. Before and after left ventricular assist device procedure, right heart catheterizations were reviewed for clinical cardiac data.

In a knee-joint-simulator four kinds of crosslinked polyethylene (one produced by sequential irradiation and annealing process, three by different remelting processes, including fixed- and mobile-bearing-types) and two UHMWPE- (fixed- and mobile-bearing) inserts were tested with the appropriate femoral and tibial component recommended from the manufacturer.
Kinematic gait analysis was conducted in 12 patients with central cord syndrome of more than one year of evolution and functional capacity for walking with one crutch or without crutches. Patients were asked to walk with one crutch and with two crutches at a freely chosen walking speed through a 10-m walkway. Three-dimensional kinematic equipment based on active markers was used to analyze temporospatial and articular parameters (maximum, minimum, and range of motion, ROM, throughout the cycle)
Forty plate-bone constructs were assembled and divided into four groups of ten. Perpendicularly placed screws were placed in one group, convergently placed crossing screws were placed in a second group, an oblique end screw was placed in a third group, and a fourth group utilized perpendicularly placed locking screws in a locking plate. All test subjects were mounted and loaded in cantilever bending to the point of failure. Stiffness, initial load to failure, and maximal load tolerated were all analyzed.
Thirty rats were divided into three groups, i.e., the hyaluronic acid group, saline group, and control group. The hyaluronic acid and saline groups received a total of four intra-articular injections, whereas no injection was administered to the control group. The hyaluronic acid group was injected with 50 microg (0.05 cc) hyaluronic acid, and the saline group was injected with 50 microl (0.05 cc) of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. All of the rats were sacrificed on day 29 and the femur-anterior cruciate ligament-tibia complexes from the right knees were prepared, tested mechanically, and evaluated histologically.
Ten subjects were analysed, instrumented with a single comprehensive marker-set of 14 markers identified from the union of the corresponding from eight current models for trunk kinematics. Activities of daily living (walking, chair rising/sitting, step-up/down), elementary trunk movements (flexion, bending and axial rotation), and isolated motion of the shoulders, both synchronous and asynchronous were collected. Resulting rotations in the three anatomical planes, both in the laboratory and in the pelvis reference frames, were calculated.
We have collected sitting postural sway data from two groups of infants, one with typical development (n=33), and one with delayed development and either diagnosed with or at risk for cerebral palsy (n=26), when the infants had developed to the point where they could just maintain sitting for about 10s. Postural sway data was collected while infants were sitting on a force platform, and the center of pressure was analyzed using both linear and nonlinear measures.
A comprehensive comparison of muscle forces and spinal loads estimated by a single-joint (L5-S1 or L4-L5) EMG-driven model (EMGAO) and a multi-joint (T1-S1) Kinematics-driven finite element model (KD) of the spine under different static lifting activities in upright standing posture is carried out. Identical geometry for the spine and trunk musculature as well as passive properties are used in both models. Required model inputs including kinematics, force plate and surface EMG data are collected from one asymptomatic male subject.
Four knee pairs were loaded in valgus bending until gross injury with or without a tibiofemoral compression pre-load. The peak valgus moment and resultant motions of the knee joint were recorded. Pressure sensitive film documented the magnitude and location of tibiofemoral contact. Cartilage fissures were documented on the tibial plateau, and microcracks in subchondral bone were documented from micro-computed tomography scans.
We analyzed the concentrations of the TM carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA15.3, CA125 and CA19.9 in both CSF and serum from 18 patients with neoplastic meningitis diagnosed by CSF cytology. We also performed these same measurements in 50 patients affected by other neurological diseases (OND) in order to evaluate putative intrathecal synthesis. In addition, CSF and serum concentrations of the proangiogenic factor VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) were evaluated.
We evaluated different sample types. Control materials and lithium heparin plasma pools were used to determine: limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), imprecision and linearity. The effects of potential endogenous interfering substances and the possibility of falsely increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations attributable to the presence of heterophilic antibodies (HA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) in high concentrations were evaluated. The 99th percentile limit of the cTnI value distribution was determined from 320 Caucasian reference individuals.

A total of 68 patients with colorectal carcinoma were recruited and the levels of RhoA and RhoC mRNA transcripts in cancer, paratumoral and normal tissues were characterized by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Their correlation to clinical histopathological parameters was analyzed.
Serum anti-CCP antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF) were evaluated in 30 patients with RA and 47 patients with chronic HCV infection. Of those with HCV infection, 20 patients had chronic HCV infection associated with articular involvement and 27 patients had chronic HCV infection without any articular involvement.
Among 1256 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004, urinary metabolites of PAH (monohydroxy-PAH), and serum GGT were measured. We selected the 10 monohydroxy-PAHs (OH-PAHs) for which at least 90% of participants had concentrations greater than the limit of detection.
We examined CRP distribution, gender difference, and determinants of CRP concentrations ranging from 0.02 mg/L to 10.0 mg/L, in 4923 Korean adults (2248 men; 2675 women) who received health checkups at Gangnam Severance Hospital from March 2006 to May 2007.
We assessed CRC incidence and mortality in a group of asymptomatic average-risk patients who underwent screening colonoscopy between 1989 and 1993 at a university hospital. By using standardized incidence ratios and standardized mortality ratios, we compared our observed CRC rates with expected rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data.
We identified 10,958 cases of established BE in the Caris Diagnostics pathology database from January 2002-April 2007. Demographic, pathologic, and endoscopic data were recorded. Dysplasia was categorized as low grade, high grade, or adenocarcinoma. Adherence was defined as &gt; or =4 esophageal biopsies per 2 cm BE or a ratio &gt; or =2.0. Generalized estimating equation multivariable analysis was performed to assess factors associated with adherence, adjusted for clustering by individual gastroenterologist.
Thirty-nine adults (mean age, 50 years; 24 female) with refractory reflux symptoms were evaluated by impedance/pH monitoring while on therapy, followed by wireless pH monitoring while off therapy. Non-acid reflux events in patients on therapy were correlated with acid reflux parameters studied off therapy. In addition, the likelihood of test abnormalities on and off therapy was determined.
We reviewed the records of adult patients with NASH cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation by using a prospectively collected database from a single center. Data from patients with NASH cirrhosis were compared with matched controls who received transplantation for primary biliary cirrhosis/primary sclerosing cholangitis, alcoholic liver disease, or HCV.
Cases of severe multi-organ iron overload were identified by review of autopsy protocols and Perls-stained tissue specimens, analysis of hepatocyte and Kupffer cell iron levels, and measurement of liver tissue iron concentrations.
We measured HRQOL in 156 patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation by using the Short Form Liver Disease Quality of Life instrument. We followed patients prospectively and used Cox proportional hazard models to measure the independent effect of baseline HRQOL on survival, adjusting for MELD and other covariates.
Records were reviewed retrospectively from 4671 adult patients who had at least 1 office visit during a 2-year period. Demographic information and laboratory data were collected. An elevated ALT level was defined as &gt;19 IU/mL for women and &gt;30 IU/mL for men.
By using the 1993-2005 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified 581,380 cirrhotic patients who had been admitted to hospitals. The proportion discharged against medical advice and predictors of self-discharge were analyzed by using regression models with adjustments for clinical factors, including illness severity.
A monoclonal antibody specific for an eosinophil secondary granule protein (eosinophil peroxidase [EPX]) was developed and shown to specifically identify intact eosinophils and detect eosinophil degranulation in formalin-fixed specimens. A histopathologic scoring algorithm was developed to analyze data from patient evaluations; the utility of this algorithm was assessed by using archived esophageal tissues from patients with known diagnoses of EoE and GERD as well as controls from 2 tertiary care centers.
We studied 2741 primary-care outpatients, 18-70 years in age, who met Rome II criteria for dyspepsia. Patients with alarm features (dysphagia, bleeding, weight loss, etc) were excluded. All patients underwent endoscopy. The cost and diagnostic yield of an early endoscopy strategy in all patients were compared with those of endoscopy limited to age-defined cohorts. Costs were calculated for a low, intermediate, and high cost environment.
In this multicenter, randomized, single blind, noninferiority trial, 362 patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups that were given oral mesalamine 2 g, once daily, or 1 g, twice daily, for 12 months. The primary objective was to compare remission rates at 1 year, based on the ulcerative colitis disease activity index score, using Kaplan-Meier methodology.
Eighty-two patients with newly diagnosed HL were prospectively included in the study. All patients were staged with both conventional clinical staging (CCS) methods, including computed tomography (CT) and whole-body FDG-PET methods. A standard of reference for the nodal regions and the extranodal organs was determined using all available information, including the CCS methods, FDG-PET, the diagnostic histology and the follow-up examinations. The results of the CCS were then compared to the FDG-PET results.
Fourteen patients with esophageal cancer underwent CT, conventional bronchoscopy, EUS, and EBUS for preoperative staging. All patients underwent EBUS and EUS with an Olympus(R) MH-908 echoendoscope at 7.5 MHz. Seven patients were eligible for the study according to the inclusion criteria.
A prospective study was performed with 30 postmenopausal women before and immediately after the end of treatment with 100 mg/day of an isoflavones-rich, concentrated soy extract for six months. A skin punch was performed in the gluteal region for sample collection before and immediately after the treatment program. Morphometric determination of epidermal thickness, the papillary index (wrinkling), and the amount of dermal elastic and collagen fibers was assessed. In addition, the number of blood vessels in the sample was also evaluated. The paired Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis (P &lt; 0.05).
Aitchison's compositional distance was used to calculate vectors for each possibility of allocation in a covariate adaptive method. Two different procedures were designed to allocate patients in small blocks or sequentially one-by-one.
We retrospectively reviewed the records of the 39 patients who received lung transplantation in our institution between August 2003 and August 2006. Twenty-nine patients survived one year post-transplantation, and all of them were followed.
Twenty nulliparous women with no anatomical alterations and/or dysfunction of the pelvic floor were enrolled in our study. All the women had the ability to voluntarily contract their PFM (Pelvic Floor Muscles), as assessed by digital palpation. The intra-vaginal pressure was assessed using three different brands of perineometer (Neurodyn Evolution, SensuPower and Peritron). Each volunteer was evaluated on three alternate days by a single examiner using a single brand of perineometer on each day. In the assessment, the volunteers were required to pull (contract) their PFM in and up as strongly as possible 3 times and to sustain the contraction for 5 seconds, with an interval of 30 seconds between each pull. For the statistical analysis, a concordance correlation coefficient was used to compare the values that were obtained with each brand of perineometer.
A retrospective review was performed of patients who were admitted with lung metastases, and who underwent thoracotomy for resection, after treatment of a primary tumor. Data were collected regarding demographics, tumor features, treatment, and outcome.
A retrospective study of 48 patients (81 eyes) with PCG who underwent primary trabeculectomy, trabeculotomy, or combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy (CTT).
We analyzed 1588 patients with MI who had been included prospectively in a databank and followed for up to 7.5 years. In this population, 548 patients were &gt;70 years old (elderly group--EG), and 1040 were &lt;70 years of age (younger group--YG); 1088 underwent IT during hospitalization, and the remaining 500 were treated medically (conservative therapy--CT). Patients were monitored either by visit or by phone at least once a year. A standard questionnaire was administered to all patients. The impact of IT was analyzed with both non-adjusted and adjusted models.
Male albino Wistar rats (10-12 weeks old) were exposed to RF-EMR from an active GSM (0.9/1.8 GHz) mobile phone for 1 hour continuously per day for 28 days. Controls were exposed to a mobile phone without a battery for the same period. The phone was kept in a cage with a wooden bottom in order to address concerns that the effects of exposure to the phone could be due to heat emitted by the phone rather than to RF-EMR alone. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last exposure and tissues of interest were harvested.
Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. Excision and end-to-end anastomosis was performed in the distal colon of the rat. The Famotidine Group received 2 mg/kg/day famotidine; the Control Group received the same amount of saline. Bursting pressure of anastomoses and hydroxyproline content of perianastomotic tissues were evaluated on the third and seventh days following surgery.
Bibliometric indicators based on searches for author affiliation of original scientific articles or reviews published in journals indexed in the databases Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and SciELO from January 2000 to December 2003 were used in this study. The retrieved records were analyzed according to the index parameters of the journals and modes of access. The number of citations was used to calculate the institutional impact factor.
To induce scleroderma, female New Zealand rabbits (n = 12) were subcutaneously immunized with 1 mg/ml of collagen V (Col V) in complete Freund's adjuvant, twice with a thirty-day interval. Fifteen days later, the animals received an intramuscular booster with type V collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, twice with a fifteen-day interval. The control group was inoculated with 1 ml of 10 mM acetic acid solution diluted with an equal amount of Freund's adjuvant. Serial dorsal skin biopsies were performed at 7, 15, and 30 days and stained with H&amp;E, Masson's trichrome and Picros√≠rius for morphological and morphometric analyses.
Eight different heat and moisture exchangers were studied using a respiratory system analog. The system included a heated chamber (acrylic glass, maintained at 37 degrees C), a preserved swine lung, a hygrometer, circuitry and a ventilator. Humidity and temperature levels were measured using eight distinct interposed heat and moisture exchangers given different tidal volumes, respiratory frequencies and flow-rate conditions. Recovery of absolute humidity (%RAH) was calculated for each setting.
Twenty-nine pigs were subjected to severe liver injury and treated 30 min later with either: (1) 2 mg terlipressin in a bolus, (2) placebo-treated controls, (3) 4 mL/kg 7.5% hypertonic NaCl, (4) 4 mL/kg 7.2% hypertonic-hyperoncotic hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5, or (5) normal saline at three times lost blood volume.
Through "reasoning by analogy" we defined an approach for the representation and implementation of "presentational knowledge". A proof-of-concept implementation was built to validate its implementability and to test for unanticipated issues.
This review attempts a critical reading of the literature.
Kidneys of 21 pigs were exposed in situ to warm ischemia for 60min. The kidneys were randomly allocated to three experimental groups, each receiving a 4-h treatment of either cold storage, machine perfusion, or retrograde oxygen persufflation. Tissue samples were examined for malondialdehyde and histological changes. Daily blood samples were examined for creatinine levels.
Simulated indirect restorations were prepared by application of resin composite (Clearfil AP-X) or FRC (EverStick) to nylon rings with 1.5mm thickness and 8mm diameter, followed by light-curing. Resin composite basing material (Clearfil Majesty Flow or Clearfil AP-X) was applied to identical rings and light-cured through the simulated indirect restorations with exposure times of 20, 40, or 60s. Light-curing though a ring without resin material (=no indirect restoration) served as control. For each combination of basing material and indirect restoration 10 specimens were prepared for each exposure time. Top and bottom surface Vickers microhardness numbers (VHNs) of basing materials were recorded after 24h.
Rectangular specimens were prepared from different ceramic materials (glass/lithium disilicate glass/glass-infiltrated zirconia/partially sintered zirconia/hipped zirconia ceramic) and polished; surface roughness (Ra) was determined. Glass plates were used as a control. Specimens were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or an artificial saliva (protein mixture; 2h, 37 degrees C). Surface free energy (gamma(t)) and its polar (gamma(p)) and disperse (gamma(d)) contribution were determined prior to and after artificial saliva exposure. Uncoated and protein-coated specimens were incubated with Streptococcus gordonii DSMZ 6777, Streptococcus oralis DSMZ 20068 or Streptococcus sanguinis DSMZ 20068 suspension for 2.5h at 37 degrees C (n=15 for each treatment and strain). Adherent streptococci were quantified fluorometrically.
The dental elastomers were subjected to tensile testing and Shore A scale hardness measurements. Young's moduli were calculated from the hardness values using the Gent equation and the BS 903 equation. These calculated values were then compared with values derived experimentally from the tensile tests.
Specimens were prepared using the conventional lost wax technique for gold and nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys, and by cutting blocks and bar for CAD-CAM ceramic and stainless-steel (St-St) alloy, respectively. All specimens were polished (600grit SiC paper), and ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol for 5min. After they were immersed in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) and 1% lactic acid, and were kept at 37 degrees C for 7 days, the elemental release (mug/cm(2)) from each material was analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The rate (n=5) was statistically analyzed by ANOVA/Tukey test (p&lt;0.05). Two immersion blank solutions were used as a negative control group.
Seven experimental one-step adhesives with a varying amount of camphorquinone ranging from 0 to 5.25wt% were prepared. Their micro-tensile bond strength to enamel and dentin was determined. In addition, the bond strength was also determined when the adhesive was not light-cured prior to the application of the composite. SEM and TEM were used for further evaluation of the resultant interfacial ultrastructure.
Selective infiltration etched zirconia discs (Procera; NobelBiocare) were coated with one of four novel engineered zirconia primers containing reactive monomers and were bonded to resin-composite discs (Panavia F2.0). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was carried out to examine the chemical activation of zirconia primers from mixing time and up to 60min. The bilayered specimens were cut into microbars (1mm(2) in cross-section area) and zirconia-resin microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was evaluated immediately and after 90 days of water storage at 37 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the fracture surface.
GIC discs 2mm thick and 10mm in diameter were made (Amalgomer CR, Advanced Healthcare, Tonbridge, Kent, UK), randomly divided into 8 groups and stored at 37 degrees C in air or artificial saliva (AS) for 1, 7, 30 and 90 days. Discs were tested by loading centrally using a 20mm diameter hard steel ball while resting freely on a filled-nylon substrate (E: 10GPa), at 23 degrees C in air. The failure load at the first bottom-initiated radial crack was detected acoustically.
Experimental composites were prepared with an identical resin formulation [TEGDMA:UDMA:bis-GMA of 30.25:33.65:33.65]. Five groups of resin were prepared at varied CQ concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6wt% of the resin). Five subgroups of resin were prepared at each level of CQ concentration, by adding EDMAB at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8wt% of the resin, resulting in 25 experimental resins. Finally, strontium glass ( approximately 3microm) and silica (0.04microm) were added at 71.5 and 12.6wt% of the composite, respectively. Samples (n=3) were then evaluated for Knoop hardness (KHN), degree of conversion (DC), depth of cure (DoC) and contraction stress (CS).
An electrochemical anodization treatment was used to produce a network oxide layer on Ti surface. Surface characterization of the network layer was carried out using thin film X-ray diffractometer and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were made to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) by retroviral transduction. The GFP signal was measured in situ to assess in vitro and in vivo cell growth on Ti surfaces. In vivo experiments on Ti-supported cell growth were carried out on the back skin of nude mice. Alizarin red staining and immunofluorescent staining were used to observe cell differentiation.
A selection of key publications (1 book, 35 scientific original publications and 1 website source) covering the areas nanotechnology, antimicrobial materials, stimuli responsive materials, self-repairing materials and materials for tissue engineering with direct or indirect relations and/or implications to resin-based dental materials is critically reviewed and discussed. Connections between these fields and their potential for resin-based dental materials are highlighted and put in perspective.
Thirty-nine patients received 98 Cergogold inlays with at least one inlay luted with Definite Multibond/Definite (n=45) and at least one inlay luted with Syntac/Variolink Ultra (n=53) in a split mouth design. Treatments were carried out in two private practices by two operators (Operator A: n=38; Operator B: n=60). Forty-four cavities required caries profunda treatment, 23 cavities exhibited no enamel at the cervical margin. At baseline (2 months), and after 6, 14, 27, and 51 months of clinical service, the restorations were investigated according to modified USPHS criteria.
Experiments have been performed in an isolated system using MMA, TEGDMA or HEMA, respectively exposed to pig liver esterase (PLE) in phosphate buffer. The reaction of tested comonomers was terminated by the use of sodium hydroxide solution, sulfuric acid or saturated NaCl solution, respectively. The samples were analyzed by the use of headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
BelleGlass NG (indirect resin; 10 shades) and Estelite Sigma (direct resin; 12 shades), and 4 shades of veneer ceramics were investigated. Bovine enamel was used as a reference. Reflected and transmitted colors of specimens were measured relative to the illuminants D65, A and F2 with a reflection spectrophotometer. OP values relative to the three illuminants [OP(D65), OP(A) and OP(F2)], difference in OP (DeltaOP) and OP difference ratio relative to OP(D65) [DeltaOP/OP(D65)] by the change of illuminants were calculated. Within each restorative material, DeltaOP and DeltaOP/OP(D65) values were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the fixed factors of the shade designation and the combination of illuminants (alpha=0.05).
The occlusal one-third of the crown was removed from six unerupted human third molars; a uniform smear layer was created with 600 grit SiC. The dentin surface was etched with 35% phosphoric acid for 15s before applying BisGMA/HEMA model adhesive using either water wet or ethanol wet bonding technique. Five-micro-thick sections of adhesive/dentin interface specimens were cut and stained with Goldner's trichrome for light microscopy. Companion slabs were analyzed with SEM and micro-Raman spectroscopy.
Camphorquinone (CQ) and OPPI were combined in various proportions with the amine co-initiator 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and used at two levels in which CQ + OPPI + DMAEMA = 1 wt.% or 3 wt.% to photoinitiate a BisGMA/BisEMA/TEGDMA (37.5:37.5:25 wt.%) monomer blend.A total of eight groups (four groups for each level of total photoinitiator, 1% and 3%) were tested according to the following proportion of components in the photoinitiator system: Group C: CQ only. Group CO: CQ + OPPI (1:2). Group CA: CQ + DMAEMA (1:2). Group COA: CQ + OPPI + DMAEMA (1:1:1). Each monomer was polymerized using a quartz-halogen curing unit (Demetron 400, Demetron Research Corp., Danbury, CT) with an intensity of 400 mW/cm2 for 5 s, 20 s, 40 s, 60 s, 300 s and their conversion levels (DC) were determined at each exposure time using a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR).To examine color stability, experimental composite resins were made by mixing 3.2% silanated barium glass (78 wt.%, average filler size; 1 microm) with each monomer system, except both CQ only group and 1% CO group, which were found to cure insufficiently to be able to prepare useful specimens. Disk-shaped samples (10 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness) were made and stored under the conditions of dry or saline solution at room temperature (25 degrees C) or 60 degrees C water bath. Each CIELAB scale was determined with a colorimeter (CHROMA METER CR-400) at the time of baseline (day after curing), 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks later.
Different light-curing protocols were used in order to investigate the influence of energy density, power density, and mode of cure on the properties of a model polymer. The modes of cure were continuous, pulse-delay, and stepped irradiation of the specimens. Wallace hardness was used to determine the softening of the polymer after storage in ethanol for 24h. Elution of monomers from the polymer was assessed after 7 days in ethanol by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data were submitted to two- and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Newman-Keuls' multiple comparison test, and linear regression analysis.
This study was a prospective clinical trial in which 20 consecutive patients requiring an archwire change as part of their course of orthodontic fixed appliance therapy, had either a nickel titanium or stainless steel archwire fitted as deemed clinically necessary. The effect of clinical use was determined by comparing distal end cuts of the "as received" archwires before and after decontamination, with the same retrieved archwires following clinical use and decontamination. Hardness, elastic modulus and surface roughness were determined using an atomic force microscope (AFM) coupled with a nanoindenter.
Variolink 2 (VL2), Multilink Automix (MA), Multilink Sprint (MS, all Ivoclar-Vivadent), Nexus 2 (NX2), Maxcem (MX, both Kerr) and RelyX Unicem (RX, 3M-Espe) were investigated. MS, MX and RX were self-adhesive; others require a bonding-agent. All measurements were conducted at 23 degrees C for 60min (n=5), except 80min for RX, with materials self-cured only (sc) and dual-cured (dc); NX2 and VL2 were additionally light-cured only (lc). S(Y) was measured by the bonded-disk method [Watts DC, Cash AJ. Determination of polymerization shrinkage kinetics in visible-light-cured materials: methods development. Dent Mater 1991;7(4):281-7; Watts DC, Marouf AS. Optimal specimen geometry in bonded-disk shrinkage-strain measurements on light-cured biomaterials. Dent Mater 2000;16(6):447-51]; S(Z) by the Bioman instrument [Watts DC, Satterthwaite JD. Axial shrinkage-stress depends upon both C-factor and composite mass. Dent Mater 2008;24(1):1-8 [Epub October 24, 2007]; Watts DC, Marouf AS, Al-Hindi AM. Photo-polymerization shrinkage-stress kinetics in resin-composites: methods development. Dent Mater 2003;19(1):1-11]. Light-cure was achieved by QTH at 500mW/cm(2). The respective DCs were measured under the same conditions by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. Data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA plus Bonferroni test, and by t-test, at p&lt;0.05.
Endothelial cells [human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)] were examined for FN production and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes for hypertrophy, following incubation with glucose, ET-1, leptin and specific blockers. FN, ET-1, leptin and leptin receptors mRNA expression and FN protein were measured. Myocytes were also morphometrically examined. Furthermore, hearts from streptozotocin-diabetic rats were analysed.
An 8-week, randomized, parallel-group study that enrolled 90 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, who were randomly assigned to receive either insulin or metformin, was carried out. The doses of insulin and metformin were titrated according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) during the 4 weeks; the target of FPG was 126 mg/dL and that of PPG was 160 mg/dL. The blood glucose levels were kept stabilized till the end of the study. The serum concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured before starting the study and 4 and 8 weeks after initiation of insulin or metformin therapy.
Fifteen sedentary, obese, male participants, who met the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria for MetS, were treated with extended-release niacin (Niaspan) for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained before and after treatment with niacin.
Segments of saphenous vein were obtained from both normal people and diabetic patients (HbA(1c) &lt; 6.0%) at the time of coronary surgery. Cultured endothelial cells were incubated in the absence/presence of AGEs (2 and 20 microM), and mRNA and protein for both receptor of AGEs (RAGE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-gamma) were analysed by real-time polymerised chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis. In the same fashion, the cell release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was estimated in the absence/presence of AGEs by spectrofluorimetric analysis. Finally, neutrophil-endothelial adhesion was evaluated in saphenous vein segments with and without the addition of AGEs.
ES cells differentiated in vitro into insulin-producing cells according to the Lumelsky protocol or a new four-stage differentiation protocol were analysed morphologically before and after implantation for gene expression by in situ reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and protein expression by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural analysis.
This cross-sectional controlled study evaluated 159 diabetic patients during a 3-min posture test (standing-squatting-standing) with continuous measurement of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean (MBP) blood pressure by a Finapres device. Arterial stiffness was indirectly assessed by PP and the slope of PP as a function of MBP calculated during the whole 3-min test. CAN was assessed by the expiration/inspiration pulse interval ratio (E/I R-R ratio) during deep breathing and by three indices measured during the squatting test. Patients were divided into four groups according to diabetes duration (&lt;10 years, 11-20 years, 21-30 years and &gt; 30 years from group 1 to group 4, respectively) and compared with age-matched non-diabetic subjects.
Thirty-five patients with LADA were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous insulin alone (n = 18) or insulin plus 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1-alpha(OH)D3; 0.5 microg per day) (n = 17) for 1 year. Plasma C-peptide levels in fasting state (FCP) and 2 h after 75-g glucose load (PCP) were measured every 6 months with radioimmunoassay.
Y1 cells were incubated for 7 days with either normal or high glucose (HG, 30 mmol/L) concentrations, with or without antioxidant treatment. Parameters of oxidative stress and expression levels of haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nitrite levels, L-arginine uptake and progesterone production were determined.
Selective literature research, with consideration of the authors' own publications.
150 patients (110 men and 40 women, aged 66.1 +/- 1.7 years) underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy, capillary blood gas analysis, measurement of NT-proBNP, and echocardiography to determine the diameter of the left atrium (LAD) and the peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).
We measured total BPA concentration by mass spectrometry in first-morning urine samples from 60 premenopausal women. We selected from each woman's stored daily collections three urine samples approximately 2 and 4 weeks apart. Samples were selected from both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle to assess cycle effects. Temporal variability was assessed with mixed model regression and correlations.
Asthmatic children (N=300) aged 4-12 years were followed for 1 year. Household dust samples from two indoor locations were analyzed for allergens including dust mite (Der p 1, Der f 1), cat (Fel d 1), dog (Can f 1), cockroach (Bla g 1). Daily symptoms and medication use were collected in monthly telephone interviews. Annual disease severity was examined in models including allergens, specific IgE sensitivity and adjusted for age, gender, atopy, ethnicity, and mother's education.
RF-EMF exposure of 166 volunteers from Basel, Switzerland, was measured with personal exposure meters (exposimeters). Participants carried an exposimeter for 1 week (two separate weeks in 32 participants) and completed an activity diary. Mean values were calculated using the robust regression on order statistics (ROS) method.
Seventeen metals (including Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, U) and non-metals (including As) were measured by ICP-MS in urine spot samples from 351 subjects (32% women), aged 2-74 yr (mean 33 yr). Forty subjects (controls) lived 400 km outside the mining area; 311 subjects lived in the mining area, either very close (&lt; 3 km) (n=179; 6 communities) or moderately close (3-10 km) (n=132; 4 communities) to mines or smelting plants.
The levels of lead and mercury exposure of students were determined by blood, urine, and hair analyses (ICP-MS, CV-AAS). Genotyping of common polymorphisms was examined by MALDI-TOF MS and the TaqMan methodology. Associations between lead and mercury exposures and genetic background were examined by bivariate analysis, and by categorical regression analysis (CATREG) controlled by metal- and matrix-specific variables.
We compared PM(2.5) concentrations calculated by the ExTra index to reference measures (passive samplers situated under the covered part of the playground), in 15 schools in Bordeaux, in 2000. First, we collected the input data required by the ExTra index: background and local pollution depending on traffic, meteorology and topography. Second, the ExTra index was calculated for each school. Statistical analysis consisted of a graphic description; then, we calculated an intraclass correlation coefficient.
In this article, we describe a method (SALSAstand) to effectively elevate, offload, and protect the foot with an external fixation device, while also promoting flap healing, maintaining tendon correction, and limiting the tendon retraction and contracture that is commonly seen following a foot-salvage procedure in high-risk patients.
For the measurement of the activity of class I and II ADH isoenzymes and ALDH activity the fluorometric methods was employed. The total ADH activity and activity of class III and IV isoenzymes was measured by the photometric method. The study material consisted of vessels wall samples obtained from 45 abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Immunoperoxidase-staining methods and specific monoclonal antibodies were used to examine the expression of p53, BCL-2 and EGF-R in partial and complete moles (10 cases each). Trophoblastic tissue from first trimester terminations of pregnancy (non-molar tissue, 20 specimens) served as a control group. The data were evaluated to determine variations in the expression pattern among the molar and non-molar tissues.
HE staining was used for the measurement of cardiac hypertrophy. Immunohistochemical technique was used to evaluate the location of alpha-enolase. The expressions of alpha-enolase in the left cardiac ventricles at different development times were examined by Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot.
A total of 132 patients were studied. Treatment duration was 3 months, followed by a 2 months follow-up period.
In both 2002 and 2005, anonymous postal surveys were sent out, involving eight criteria pertaining to three main areas to assess compliance, to 245 hepatogastroenterologists based in private and public hospitals, and in the community, in a specific region of France. The multifaceted intervention was based on reminders, conferences, postal campaigns and esophageal mapping. Main outcome measures were based on biopsies for diagnosis, surveillance intervals and management of patients with high-grade dysplasia.
In 183 consecutive cases of scleroderma, as diagnosed by American College of Rheumatology criteria (1980). Patients' mean age was 40.6+/-13.3 years, the gender ratio was 0.13 and the average duration of disease was 6.8+/-7.5 years. A localized, cutaneous form was observed in 148 patients (81%) and a diffuse form in 35 (19%). All patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and standard esophageal manometry.
We performed a cross-sectional study in 165 inmates with chronic hepatitis C and liver biopsy from two Spanish prisons. LF was staged according to the Metavir Index and was subsequently reclassified as mild or absent (LF&lt;or=1), significant (LF&gt;or=2) or serious (LF&gt;or=3). APRI and FIB-4 were calculated in all patients. The predictive value was calculated by the area under the curve and the optimal cut-off was obtained based on the best specificity value for each LF stage. Then, we analyzed the sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each cut-off point.
A cross-sectional study was performed. We applied a questionnaire that included sociodemographic variables, types of food, identification of IBS by the Rome III criteria, the Zung self-rating depression scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and self-reported use of medical services among a random sample of an adult population in Bucaramanga. Univariate analysis and logistic regression was used to establish associations.
Grounded theory using a mix of systematic coding, data analysis, and theoretical sampling was performed. Spouses, 10 women and 3 men between 39 and 85 years, were interviewed.
For the purposes of the study, a qualitative methodology using intepretative phenomenologic analysis was used. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 11 couples. Patients were predominantly male, aged between 50 and 70 years, and partners were aged between 45 and 64 years. All couples were married.
A secondary analysis was used to investigate the relationships among social support, depression, functional status, and postoperative length of stay. Included were 70 patients undergoing first-time CABG. Patients had a mean age of 72 years and were primarily white (94%) and male (66%). Complete data were collected on 63 participants.
HRQoL was measured by the 15D in 3 stages: 1, 6, and 12 months after CABG. The focus in this study is on HRQoL at the second (6 months) and third (12 months) stages of the recovery process. Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to identify the associations of independent variables with HRQoL.
A Swedish national survey was carried out to obtain knowledge on the information provided by cardiac health care professionals on the subject of sexual function and coexistence after an MI. It consisted of a questionnaire that was designed, tested, and sent to 121 coronary care units.
ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation were monitored using the SAS and BIS. Nurses initiated event markers with BIS at the time of SAS assessment but were blinded to BIS scores.
We performed a comprehensive literature search. The extracted data from selected studies were used to construct a regression model and evaluate the effect of treatment, time on medication, severity of illness, age, gender, and number of previous episodes.
We conducted an open-label 12-week trial of duloxetine 60 mg daily in 15 patients with IBS without concurrent major depressive disorder. The primary outcome measure was average abdominal pain. Secondary measures included IBS symptoms, Clinical Global Impression-Severity, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, IBS Quality-of-Life Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale. We analyzed changes using random regression and one-sample t-tests.
Analysis of pre- and post-treatment PRL levels collected prospectively per protocol in a non-randomized study of 26 melperone-, 76 clozapine-, and 66 neuroleptic-treated patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Cross-sectional analysis of a larger sample of patients with PRL data was also performed.
Reviews of four key areas were conducted: commonly used techniques in the assessment of wakefulness; neurobiology of sleep/wake and cognition; targets of wake promoting and/or cognition enhancing drugs; and ongoing clinical trials investigating wake promoting effects.
A group of 79 nurses from seven emergency departments assessed simulated patient cases and assigned triage categories using the same principles as in their daily work. K statistics, accuracy, over-triage and under-triage were then analyzed. The nurses performed 1027 triage assessments.
Evidence was collated using electronic databases; Pubmed, Ovid, Medline and Cochrane library. Search terms included [torus fractures; buckle fractures; splinting distal radius fractures; paediatric wrist fractures; paediatric forearm fractures/injuries; cast versus splint]. Searches identified papers published between 1984 and June 2008.
60 symptomatic allergic patients were enrolled. A group of 50 healthy subjects was included as a control. Serum sHLA-G and sHLA-A, -B, -C levels were determined by an immunoenzymatic method. Allergy severity was assessed by VAS for symptoms and drug use.
We clinically scored the uveitis over time in B10.RIII, C57BL/6, and melanocortin 5 receptor knock-out (MC5r((-/-))) mice with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) that were conjunctively injected with a naked DNA plasmid encoding ACTH1-17 at the time of EAU onset and three days later. The post-EAU retina histology of plasmid injected eyes was examined, and post-EAU concentrations of alpha-MSH in aqueous humor was assayed by ELISA.
Twelve patients were enrolled in this study. At PVAN diagnosis, MMF was replaced by leflunomide. Other immunosuppressive drug doses and levels were maintained unchanged. T-cell functions, i.e., intralymphocyte cytokine expression (IL-2 and TNF-alpha), T-cell activation [i.e., transferrin receptor (CD71) and interleukin (IL)-2 alpha-chain (CD25) expression], and T-cell proliferation were measured using a flow-cytometry whole-blood assay before and at one month after conversion.
We studied 1,220 adult past and current smokers drawn from a national face-to-face interview survey administered in 2004. We defined two types of cues possibly triggering a smoker to have a cigarette: peer cues and psychological cues. We used ordinary least square linear regressions to analyze smoking amount and response to peer and psychological distress cues.
The present study combines classical bibliometric tools with novel scientometric and visualizing techniques in order to analyse and categorise research in the field of tobacco control.
The following parameters were evaluated using "Before-After-Control-Impact" (BACI) design: frequency and geographic extent of larval production, intensity of larval production, changes in larval habitat, and number of larvicide applications. The analyses were performed using Moran's I, Getis-Ord, and Spatial Scan statistics on aggregated before and after data as well as data collected over time. This allowed comparison of control and treatment areas to identify changes attributable to the OMWM/marsh restoration modifications.

The information included in the overview is based on legal documents and publicly available year reports of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE).
Analysis of key documents (e.g. literature, laws, and other official documentation) and personal experiences.
Relying on multiple historical literature and other documents as well as drawing on personal experiences and observations, we describe, evaluate, and explain the evolving and dynamic HTA-related evidence landscape.
The Danish Institute for HTA was established in the National Board of Health in 1997 with responsibility for coordination and production of HTA. A local government reform from 2007 provides several new challenges to HTA and its coordination.
Founded in 1978, the Italian National Health Service (NHS) has been strongly regionalized mainly after a constitutional reform, which started a devolution process. HTA started in the 1980s at the National Institute of Health and in a few University Hospitals, with a focus on big ticket technology: that process was driven by clinical engineers.
The approach used here is a historical review of facts and landmarks.
The method used in this study was a historical analysis based mainly on the knowledge of the authors, but supplemented by the published literature.
A general examination of some pre-HTA activities, as consensus conferences, closer reading of all background papers to the establishment of an HTA agency in Norway, the ongoing activities of this agency, its evaluation, and its merge into a broader knowledge center for the health services were performed. All information and statements are the authors' own understandings, but also were reviewed by some of the people taken part in these processes.
The methods used are a review of important materials that have described the development process and present situation, supplemented by some personal experiences.
Analysis of public documents, personal communication, and literative review.
The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Unit was set up in Malaysia in August 1995 in the Ministry of Health Malaysia and has since grown tremendously in size and resources. To date, forty-three in-depth assessments have been carried out, and the recommendations of these assessments were subsequently implemented. In addition, approximately 140 rapid assessment reports were produced in response to requests from policy and decision makers. HTA has been able to provide input into formulation of national and Ministry of Health Malaysia policies, and provide a basis for clinical practice guidelines development, input into purchasing decisions, regulation of drugs, as well as advertisements related to health.
This study was conducted through extensive document reviews including these published in both domestic and international literature.
The study is a discussion/review based largely on the experiences of the authors, but supported by available literature.
Information was gathered through a bibliographic search and interviews with actors involved in HTA in Mexico.
The approach was a descriptive review done by people who have been very much involved in this history.
The beginnings of HTA in this region go back to the work of Dr. David Banta in China and the establishment of the Asian HTA Network. The Network embarked on increasing awareness and building capacity among personnel from the region. Attempts were made to introduce HTA in countries where it did not exist, as well as to strengthen existing HTA programs. The Network had regular meetings, and also carried out a study on the diffusion and utilization of magnetic resonance imaging in the region. In an attempt to boost the efforts of the Network, the author spearheaded the organization of the Asian Regional HTA Conferences in Kuala Lumpur in 2000 and 2003, and in Manila, Philippines, in 2004. In addition, the author carried out a survey on HTA in the region. There are two broad categories of countries in the region: Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, China, Philippines, Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan, which have formal HTA programs, and others for which informal mechanisms or related activities exist, which include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.
This article is a descriptive review from two people who have been very much involved in the events described and is based on review of relevant policy documents and Web sites.
A survey to summarize the evolution of HTA was sent to representatives of different HTA initiatives in Spain.
A new national health insurance program began to be implemented in the Philippines in 1995 after passage of the Health Insurance Act.
This report is a descriptive analysis based on personal experiences of the authors and on selected literature.
The case study of the history of development of HTA in Lithuania is presented.
The study depends very much on the extensive experiences of the authors in involvement of HTA in China. In addition, literature review and Web site searching have been used to trace the process of growth of HTA in China.
A single center randomized controlled trial of bright light therapy versus standard light was carried out. The study was completed prior to the mandatory registration of randomized controls on the clinical trials registry database and, owing to delays in writing up, retrospective registration was not completed.
The Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) was designed as a population-based prospective cohort study on the health and aging of Korean adults aged 65 years and over. We evaluated 1000 of 1118 randomly selected subjects in terms of activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) and performance in regard to balance and gait (POMA). Activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were assessed to measure disability. Pain-related dysfunctions, depression and cognitive functions were assessed. Next, we assessed the relationship between balance confidence and physical performance and functioning by sex and age.
A nationwide representative face-to-face household survey was conducted in Germany. A representative sample of the German population aged 61 years or older (N = 1513 participants, N = 239 displaced in WWII) was approached using 258 sample points. Measurements included depressive symptoms (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-7), resilience (RS-11), general and domain-specific life satisfaction (FLZ(M)) and sociodemographic variables.
Eighteen studies addressing sleep/night-time disturbances among other neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with MCI were identified through a search of databases and an examination of reference lists of selected papers. Fifteen of those studies reported data on prevalence or severity of sleep/night-time disturbances.
A postal survey was sent to all Australian memory clinics identified by key specialists working in dementia assessment services.
A retrospective analysis was undertaken of routinely collected data (age, gender, ethnicity, admission diagnosis, psychiatric diagnosis, Mini-mental State Examination score, whether capacity was assessed, the outcome of that assessment, and discharge destination) on referrals to a liaison psychiatry service for older people (2003-2006) from medical and surgical teams at a large London teaching hospital.
Comprehensive searches were undertaken of the PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Health-Source Nursing electronic databases between 1980 and 2007 in order to identify studies that examined cognitive differences between drivers aged over 55 years who either passed or failed a driving assessment. Twenty-one studies were eligible for inclusion. Weighted Cohen's d effect sizes, percentage overlap statistics, Fail-safe Ns and 95% CIs were calculated for all cognitive tests.
The cross-sectional study was carried out as an anonymous written survey of family caregivers of dementia patients in four regions of Germany. With a 20% response it was possible to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data from 404 and 254 family caregivers respectively. Predictors for utilization were evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis. The answers to questions of quality were evaluated using qualitative content analysis.
We reviewed the research published to date on EOD, and divided the current body of knowledge into several main sections.
Thirty-six participants, aged 71-102 years, were compared using a non-randomized two-group design with continuous measures. APOE genotype was obtained by buccal swab. BSD, including restlessness, escape restraint, tapping and banging, searching and wandering, pacing and walking, and vocalization, were measured using the Modified Agitated Behavior Rating Scale. Participants were observed every 20 minutes for 12 hours per day for five days. Each participant's mean behavior scores were compared according to the presence or absence of the APOE epsilon4 allele.
Volunteers underwent a screening interview, had comprehensive cognitive testing, gave 80 ml of blood, and completed health and lifestyle questionnaires. One quarter of the sample also underwent amyloid PET brain imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB PET) and MRI brain imaging, and a subgroup of 10% had ActiGraph activity monitoring and body composition scanning.
Possible changes in rates of attempted suicides in elderly age-bands over a nine-year period and the correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in elderly age-bands in England were examined using nationally collected data.
We interviewed 220 family carers of people consecutively referred to psychiatric services with dementia in Essex and London (U.K.), using the MCTS to measure abuse. We defined abuse cases using (1) the MCTS conventional scoring system; (2) the Pillemer criteria; and (3) clinical judgment of an expert panel.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 170 AD patients (probable AD = 83; possible AD = 87) originally enrolled in a case-control study, 27 with postmortem examination, to establish the number of cases meeting probable diagnosis for FTD and DLB, using a checklist of features compiled from their consensus criteria.
The charts of elderly outpatients with mania and unipolar depression in tertiary care settings were reviewed and relevant information incorporated regarding clinical presentation, past and family history of affective disorder, treatment history and previous psychiatric and neurological history.
We undertook critical discourse analysis of obituaries in representative national and local newspapers in Canada and the U.K.
One hundred participants were recruited from in-patients in a geriatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Anxiety and depression were assessed shortly after admission, and again two months later, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Geriatric Mental Status Schedule/ AGECAT diagnostic system.
A database search for population studies on rates of dementia in LA was performed. Abstracts were also included in the search. Authors of the publications were invited to participate in this collaborative study by sharing missing or more recent data analysis with the group.
Qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 family members and seven older care recipients. Interviews were analyzed thematically.
Health records of adult patients who experienced hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, or hypophosphataemia in the ICU during the study periods were retrospectively reviewed. Effectiveness of the ERP was assessed by the number of replacement doses indicated but not given and the number of doses and total dose required to normalise the low electrolyte level. Timeliness was evaluated by the time between the laboratory reporting the low electrolyte level and administration of the replacement dose. Nurse and physician satisfaction with the ERP was assessed through a written survey.
A written survey method was used, questionnaires were sent to ICU nurses specialised in mechanical ventilation in 115 Dutch hospitals. The questions related to following domains: (1) demographics; (2) use of MH; (3) presumed benefits; (4) essential elements of the MH procedure; (5) equipment and safety.
Nineteen nurses from one CVICU consented to being interviewed individually regarding their experiences caring for patients approaching the end of life, and specifically regarding the initiation of a change in code status. Investigators used a qualitative descriptive approach to collect and analyse the data. Transcript data were analysed and as concepts emerged they were compared with those from earlier interviews to establish similarities and differences. Investigators reached consensus about the major themes.
This was a qualitative study that employed focus group discussions (FGDs) among adolescent girls (10-19 years) and key informant (KI) interviews with health workers. Age for FGD participants ranged from 16 to 19 years. The FGD participants were recruited while seeking antenatal care for their first pregnancy or immunization service for their first child, not being older than 6 months. Six health facilities were selected. Key informants were purposefully selected on the basis of being in-charge of maternity units. Thirteen FGDs comprising of a total of 92 adolescent girls were conducted. The FGDs were held with homogeneously constituted categories; married pregnant adolescents (5), unmarried pregnant adolescents (3) and married or not married adolescents with children (5). Semi structured interviews were held with six KIs who were in-charge of maternity units of health facilities. Latent content analysis technique was used for data analysis.
In the design of the algorithm we use techniques from classical scheduling theory. In addition, due to some special properties and constraints, we model the problem using methods from graph theory. The resulting algorithm combines both approaches in a transparent manner.
Observations, semi-structured interviews, and photographing were used to collect data. Participants were six nurse coordinators in a high-volume trauma hospital. Content analysis was carried out and interactions with information tools were analyzed.
Seventy-two international experts in the field of CCT independently rated all 39 indications listed in the original 2006 appropriateness statement. Indications were classified as either "appropriate," "uncertain," or "inappropriate" based on an assessment of the clinical balance between risk and benefit to the patient in daily practice. Median rater scores were considered to represent current opinion for each indication and were compared with the original value in the 2006 document.
High-pitch modes were used in patients undergoing CCTA with a dual-source CT system. Diagnostic image quality for cardiac structures and coronary arteries was assessed. Radiation dose was estimated from the scanner-generated dose-length product (DLP).
HDCT and SDCT stent imaging was performed with the use of an ex vivo phantom. HDCT was compared with SDCT with both smooth and sharp kernels for stent intraluminal diameter, intraluminal area, and image noise. Intrastent visualization was assessed with an ASIR algorithm on HDCT scans, compared with the filtered backprojection algorithms by SDCT.
Two hundred patients underwent clinically directed cardiac scanning (100 kVp, n=9 or 120 kVp, n=191; range, 300-580 mA). Effective radiation dose (in mSv) was estimated from extended dose-length product. For heart rates (HRs) &lt;65 beats/min, exposure phase was 65% up to the end of R wave of the cardiac cycle, using a one-heart beat acquisition and half-scan reconstruction. HRs from 66 to 79 beats/min and &gt; or =80 beats/min were scanned with either 2- or 3-heart beat acquisitions, respectively. Patients with arrhythmias were not excluded.
We designed a single-center, randomized controlled trial that compares MPI and CTA as the initial modality for the evaluation of patients hospitalized for chest pain without known CAD or acute myocardial infarction. Patients with intermediate-risk characteristics and a clinical need for noninvasive imaging are included. The primary outcome measured is the incidence of conventional angiography not leading to subsequent coronary revascularization within 1 year. The study is powered to detect a reduction from 11% to 3% in catheterization not leading to an intervention with a sample size of 400. Secondary outcomes include procedural complications and posttest renal dysfunction (safety outcomes), major adverse cardiovascular events, length of hospital stay, subsequent hospitalizations and imaging, changes in medical management, and tolerability of the noninvasive test.
All CCTAs performed in the ED at Lenox Hill Hospital were reviewed for clinical indications and subsequent course; patients with documented acute myocardial infarction were identified.
Experimental study.
The Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, from June to August 2005.
The study was conducted on 24 male albino Wistar rats. Sugar containing diet was prepared by mixing standard rodent diet and table sugar in the ratio of 3:1 (w/w) and rats were fed freely on this diet. Control rats were fed freely on standard rodent diet. After five weeks of treatment, control and sugar diet treated animals were injected with 8-OH-DPAT, at a dose of 0.5 mg/ml/kg, to monitor the effects of drug on food intake and brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) metabolism. Dissected neural tissue was analyzed electrochemically and findings were compared by Newman-Keuls test.
Descriptive study.
This study was conducted at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Multan, Pakistan, from 2002 to 2004.
There were 291 male soldiers between ages 30 and 45 years who presented with chest pain and had normal resting ECG. All patients were subjected to ETT. Positive ETT cases had Coronary Angiogram (CA) as the gold standard. Negative cases were subjected to TST. Normal CA cases also had TST to rule out microvascular disease. Those with normal ETT and positive CAD risk factors also had TST. Those with negative TST had CA as service requirement.
Observational.
Baqai Dental College Hospital, Karachi, from November 2005 to May 2006.
One hundred patients were assigned for single-visit root canal treatment. Patients that defaulted after the first appointment (incomplete treatment) were excluded from the study. For each tooth treated, the clinical factors and conditions existing before and after the completion of treatment were recorded. This data included patient's age, gender, type of tooth, pre-operative status of pulp and periapical tissues and recording pain and swelling (flare-ups) postoperatively after 1 day, 7 days and 1 month. The significance of results was obtained by applying paired-sample t-test and Pearson X2 test.
Case series study.
South and West Surgical Ward, Mayo Hospital, Lahore, from January 2001 to December 2007.
All patients referred electively or admitted through OPD presenting with features of progressive dysphagia due to malignancy were included in the study. The patients were investigated for site of stricture and extent of growth into the surrounding structures. All underwent transhiatal esophagectomy and gastric tube or colon was used as the conduit to restore continuity. Patients with squamous cell variety were referred to oncology department for chemoradiotherapy postoperatively. Morbidity and in-hospital mortality were recorded.
Cross-sectional study.
The study was carried out in the Department of Pathology (Histopathology), Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, from March 2006 to March 2007.

The study was conducted on 276 participants aged 25-65 years and classified into four categories of control, prehypertension (pre-HTN), hypertension (HTN) stage I and II, according to 7th JNC report. Anthropometric measurements and blood chemistry were obtained. The relationship between obesity indices (Body Mass Index [BMI], Waist Circumference [WC], Waist Hip Ratio [WHpR], Waist Height Ratio [WHtR], Basal Metabolic Rate [BMR] and Cardiovascular Disease [CVD] risk factors [blood pressure, serum lipids and glucose levels]) were investigated. The analysis of variance and test of Pearson's coefficient correlation were applied to assess relationship of all the variables.
Case control.
It was carried out at the Department of Paediatrics, Kharadar General Hospital, Karachi, from August 2003 to April 2004.
Children of the age of 6 months to 3 years with clinical, biochemical and radiological evidence of vitamin- D deficiency rickets were included. The history, clinical examination, complete blood picture, serum calcium. Phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and X-ray of wrist joint were done. The children were divided into two groups A and B. Group A was given oral vitamin-D and group B was given intramuscular injection of vitamin-D on the first day and then they were followed for two more visits at 30 and 90 days with clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations to assess the outcome.
Cohort study.
Obstetric Department of Sir Syed Trust Hospital, Karachi, from January to December 2007.
All antenatal patients attending the Outpatient Department were interviewed, after informed consent. Those who fulfilled the required criteria were grouped in 2 categories; high risk (group A cases) and low risk (group B control) pregnancies according to the risk factors identified in the history. All singleton pregnancies from 28th weeks of gestation till delivery were included in the study. All pregnant women, who had multiple pregnancies or congenital malformations were excluded. Patients were followed till delivery and neonatal outcome was assessed in both the groups. Outcome measures were recorded.

Fifty patients with history of ocular foreign body were admitted through outpatient department and emergency. History, visual acuity, ocular and general examination was done. The foreign body was localized with the radiograph of the skull and ultrasonography. Primary repair was done in patients with open wounds. Pars plana vitrectomy, magnetic or forceps extraction of foreign body was done as required visual outcomes and complications were noted.
Descriptive.
Department of Diarrhea Treatment Unit (DTU), Dow Medical College and Civil Hospital, Karachi, from November 1998 to April 2001.
Paediatric patients between the ages of &gt; 1 month to 15 years were included, who visited the DTU of the department with diarrhea. Stool samples of all these patients were checked under microscope for the vegetative forms of Entamoeba Histolytica (E.H.). Patients who were positive for E.H. were evaluated for the symtomatology including the type of diarrhea {acute watery diarrhea (AWD) or dysentery}, abdominal pain, tenesmus and nausea/vomiting. Examination carried out was assessed for state of hydration, fever and anaemia and nutritional status of those less than 5 years of age. The patients were divided into three age groups to assess the association of the age with severity and type of clinical presentation. Chi- square test was applied to calculate the p-values. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.
We performed model calculations from cross sectional growth data of healthy and CF-children to assess the methodological limitations of %IBW calculation.
In CF children infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, downloaded data from an AAD device was used to calculate morning, evening and overall monthly adherence to antibiotic therapy over a year.
9 patients with CF and ABPA (4 male, 5 female, ages 7-36 years) received HDIVPM (10-15 mg/kg/d), for 3 days per month, and itraconazole, until clinical and laboratory resolution of ABPA.
We report a case of pyomyositis of the forearm caused by Bcc infection in a patient with CF. We also briefly discuss the management of pyomyositis.
We conducted 25 in-depth qualitative interviews using the Day Reconstruction Method and 9 cognitive interviews at two CF programs, the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and then coded and analyzed for themes relating to pulmonary symptoms and related psychosocial impacts.
Men attending 5 adult CF clinics in Australasia completed a survey of SRH knowledge, attitudes and behaviours.
Data from hospital records were obtained from 3 major government hospitals. All hospital visits were stratified by age group and category of CVD. Daily PM(10) and O(3) levels reported by the Pollution Control Department from April 2002 to December 2006 (1736 days) were used in a time-series analysis with a generalized additive model procedure.
We analyzed height records for 33 000 21-year-old male military recruits, sampling 1000 per year from 1972 through 2006. We compared the height trend in Thailand to those noted in Europe, and discuss the former in the context of improvements in living circumstances in Thailand.
We studied 200 patients among whom ESRD had been newly diagnosed between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005; 200 controls were selected from among relatives of patients treated in the general surgery unit. Using a structured questionnaire, we collected information related to socioeconomic factors, history of disease, regular blood or urine screening, lifestyle, environmental exposure, consumption of vitamin supplements, and regular drug use at 5 years before disease onset.
A population-based cross sectional study of 865 participants (age: 20-69 years old, men: 46.5%) was conducted in 4 cities in Japan. Nine sociodemographic attributes (sex, age, location of residence, educational attainment, marital status, employment status, presence of dependents in the household, self-rated health, body mass index), along with exercise frequency and perception of barriers to exercise (discomfort, lack of motivation, lack of time, lack of social support, poor environment) were assessed by self-administered questionnaire.
Data were collected from 2002 through 2007 from patients who sought treatment for gastrointestinal symptoms or signs at a university clinic and subsequently underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
A total of 18,833 black and white participants from the US national REasons For Geographic And Racial Differences In Stroke (REGARDS) study were included in this analysis. Levels of sensitivity to detect AF, from least to most sensitive, were created for combinations of self-report (SR) and ECG methods, as follows: (1) SR plus ECG, (2) ECG alone, (3) SR alone, and (4) SR or ECG. Geographic regions were dichotomized as Stroke Belt (the southern US states) and non-Stroke Belt. Logistic regression analysis estimated the odd ratios of AF associated with the Stroke Belt and black ethnicity for each diagnostic combination.
Data from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System from 1990 to 2007 and the Emergency Events Reporting System from 2004 to 2007 were reviewed and epidemiologic characteristics analyzed. Hepatitis A vaccine distribution between 1992 and 2007 was also reviewed.
We conducted a comparative ecological study of Spanish provinces, with colorectal cancer mortality as the dependent variable and per capita consumption of P ovata by province and year as the independent variable. Associations were analyzed by calculating Spearman's correlation coefficients and a Poisson multiple regression model.

Videos were taken of the lesions and shown to two readers who were asked to identify the gaps ranging from less than 0.1 mm-9.8 mm.
We performed an analysis of the NYHA III/IV 839 patients randomized in the MIRACLE (n = 470) and MIRACLE-ICD (n = 369) trials. Both included patients with moderate to severe HF, ejection fraction (EF) &lt;or=35%, and QRS duration &gt;or=130 msec. Patients were grouped by age &lt;65, 65-75, and &gt;75 years. For each group, patients with CRT activated (ON) were compared with patients with CRT inactivated (OFF) for end points at 6 months, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and EF.
We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of all CRT-D implantations over a 21-month period. We compared a randomly selected contemporaneous group undergoing implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantations as a reference group. Procedure protocol involved intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring throughout the case. Lidocaine (1%) was routinely used along with propofol for sedation in all patients. Procedure time was defined as the time from initial administration of lidocaine for arterial line access, to completion of defibrillator pocket closure. Cumulative dose of propofol was calculated in each patient. Hypotension was defined as a fall in the systolic blood pressure of &gt;or=30% from baseline or a systolic blood pressure of &lt;or=80 mm Hg for &gt;3 min. CRT-D and ICD patients were divided into hypotensive and non-hypotensive subsets.

Both stroke subjects with hemiparesis and able-bodied subjects used the force-reflecting joystick to complete a suite of goal-directed tasks under various task settings. Kinematic metrics, developed for specific types of goal-directed tasks, were used to assess various aspects of upper-extremity motor performance across subjects.
Treatment parameters were statistically analyzed. Clinical outcome was assessed by matched-pair analysis based on the treatment device, differences in dose prescription, and the date of the treatment. Patients were matched according to their tumor size, age, gender, primary cancer, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group score. Survival post-radiosurgery, local and distant tumor control, and complications were analyzed. Predictive factors were investigated.
Using a cross-sectional design, consecutive patients with recurrent glioma performed a six minute walk (6MW) test to assess functional capacity. Performance status was assessed using Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scoring system. QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain scale.

A retrospective analysis on 160 adult patients (&gt; or =16 years) treated for histologically confirmed GBM between 2003 and 2005 at our Institution was performed. All patients were treated with conventional fractionated radiotherapy and a combined chemotherapy treatment with Cisplatin (CDDP) (100 mg/sqm on day 1) and carmustine (BCNU) (160 mg/sqm on day 2); the treatment was repeated every 6 weeks for five cycles. Toxicity, progression free survival and overall survival were assessed.
In this retrospective study, 51 patients with histopathologically confirmed primary cerebral gliomas who had undergone conventional MR imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted perfusion MR imaging and diffusion MR imaging were included. A retrospective blinded analysis of the imaging findings including the perfusion and diffusion parameters was done. The rCBV measurements were obtained from regions of maximum perfusion. Minimum ADC values were obtained from the region of maximum hypointensity within the tumor and from the corresponding opposite white matter. Tumor grade determined with the two methods were then compared with the histopathologic grade. Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare the DWI and PWI between tumor types. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine optimum thresholds for tumor grading and also to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for identifying high-grade gliomas.
This study includes melanoma &gt; or =7 mm in initial height, or juxtapapillary and/or juxtamacular tumors (height &gt; or =3 mm; posterior tumor margin extending to within 3 mm of optic disk rim and/or fovea).

Subjects consisted of 3,941 adult men (age &gt; or = 20 years) with no history of prostate cancer from the 2001-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relative odds of ED association with categories of BMI, WC, and physical activity.
Established thresholds were used to divide subjects into three WC and BMI categories. Physical activity level was divided into active (&gt; or =150 min/week), moderately active (30-149 min/week), and inactive (&lt;30 min/week) categories. A single survey question was used to assess the presence of ED.
Pharmacokinetic predictions of tadalafil plasma concentrations were generated based upon empirical data following 20-mg, single-dose administration coupled with tadalafil usage patterns from as-needed clinical trials.

A health questionnaire was mailed to a population-based sample from the National Population Register in 1998, 1999, and 2001. Based on their self-reported mental symptoms, a total of 116 men were selected for clinical examination in 2005. Half of them had high and the others low levels of adverse mental symptoms in all three previous follow-ups. A structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV was performed. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The Aging Males' Symptoms scale was also compiled and testosterone levels were determined.
A questionnaire study on 129 consecutive TGCC patients 3 to 5 years post-treatment was performed. Comparators were an age-matched nationally representative group of men (N = 916) included in a study on sexual life in Sweden.
Sexual functions (including erectile dysfunctional distress), time since last intercourse, sexual satisfaction, and experience of sexological treatment seeking were assessed using the same questions used in the epidemiological study on sexual life in Sweden. The findings in TGCC patients were correlated to biochemical signs of hypogonadism and type of oncological treatment: Surveillance, adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or standard doses of chemotherapy.
A total of 2035 women from the TwinsUK registry completed questionnaires relating to emotional intelligence and sexual behavior. Global emotional intelligence was measured using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF). Orgasmic frequency was assessed using two self-constructed questions.
Using Spearman's rank correlation and quartile logistic regression, we investigated whether variations in emotional intelligence are associated with female orgasmic frequency during intercourse and masturbation.
Treatment results and complications in two groups were evaluated with history and physical examination, and International Index of Erectile Function-5 Questionnaire was used for erectile function assessment. Methods. The charts of 42 men diagnosed with penile fracture were retrospectively reviewed, and two treatment modalities were compared: conservative (Group I) and surgical (Group II). Results. Between 1991 and 2008, a total of 42 patients with penile fracture were followed in our clinic for a mean of 18 months (range: 6-30 months). Five men who refused surgical treatment were treated conservatively, and the other 37 patients underwent surgical treatment. In Group II, the most common complication was painful erection (in 4 of 37 patients, 10.8 %), whereas in Group I, 80 % (4/5 patients) suffered complications such as wound infection, painful erection, penile nodule and curvature, and erectile dysfunction. Conclusion. Diagnosis of penile fracture can be based on history and physical examination; diagnostic tests such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are generally not required. Fractures must be repaired either immediately or delayed. Because management with emergency surgical repair is the most effective approach, with the lowest complication rate, surgical treatment should be preferred compared to a conservative approach.
The study cohort consisted of 713 men with type 1 DM who completed the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial and then participated in the follow-up Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study. In year 10 of EDIC, 583 (83%) completed a validated instrument assessing ED, OD, and DL and the bother these conditions cause. Statistical tests determined the concordance of function and bother in each domain, and the impact of each domain on overall sexual satisfaction.

Eighty-six patients referred to our smell and taste clinic with olfactory dysfunction were investigated. Olfactory function was assessed by means of the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery consisting of tests for odor threshold (T), odor discrimination (D), and odor identification (I). Their results were summed up to a composite score, the so-called "TDI score." All participants completed a questionnaire including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and 11 questions for evaluation of the sexual appetite in regard to the time before the onset of olfactory dysfunction and since the olfactory dysfunction. The points received for the latter questions were summed up to the so called Sexual Appetite Index (SAI).

A prospective clinical study was performed. Dogs were included if they had evidence of cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency or persistent or recurrent lameness following surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Dogs were sedated for a computed tomography scan of the affected stifle, orientated in the dorsal plane. A survey computed tomography scan was followed by a computed tomography arthrogram. A stifle arthrotomy was performed, and the surgical findings were recorded. The computed tomography scans were reviewed by three blinded reviewers, and the results were compared to the surgical findings.
A retrospective study was performed reviewing computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging archives of eight institutions for dogs with segmental caudal vena cava aplasia. Inclusion criteria included a computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging study and supportive diagnostic and follow-up information. Abdominal vessels were reviewed for size, shape, location and course (including tributaries and branches) and classified as normal, abnormal or shunt vessels.
Forty small breed dogs undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was intraoperatively laid on warmed gel pads, and the other group was additionally wrapped in a Sirius rescue sheet. Oesophageal body temperature was determined every 10 minutes and compared between groups. Temperature of gel pads was measured preoperatively and postoperatively to compare heat loss of the gel pads between groups.

All patients who underwent lobectomy for clinical stage 1A lung cancer by computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scan were identified from a prospective database. Patient characteristics were compared by the Student t test, Pearson chi(2), and Fisher exact test. A propensity score-matched analysis was performed. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Complications were assessed by a multivariate logistic regression model evaluating age, sex, comorbidities, pulmonary function, tumor size, nodal status, surgeon, and histologic characteristics.
We performed a retrospective review from December 1972 through December 2002.
We performed a single-institution retrospective cohort study. Data included patient demographics, stage, treatment, pathologic findings, and postoperative outcomes.
Twelve adult pigs underwent long-segment (6 cm, 60% of total length) tracheal resection. Autologous costal cartilage strips measuring 6 cm x 2 mm were harvested from the chest wall and inserted at regular 0.5-cm intervals between dermal layers of a cervical skin flap. The neotrachea was then scaffolded by rotating the composite cartilage skin flap around a silicone stent measuring 6 cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The neotrachea replaced the long segment of tracheal resection, and the donor flap site was closed with a double-Z plasty. Animals were killed at 1 week (group I, n = 4), 2 weeks (group II, n = 4), and 5 weeks (group III, n = 4). In group III the stent was removed 1 week before death. Viability of the neotrachea was monitored by means of daily flexible bronchoscopy and histologic examination at autopsy. Long-term morbidity and mortality were determined by monitoring weight gain, respiratory distress, and survival.
We reviewed the case histories of 25 consecutive patients operated on between 1987 and 2004 for intrathoracic recurrence (7 mediastinal, 18 nonmediastinal) after radical thymomectomy. Complete resection was performed in 14 patients. In the other 11 patients incomplete resection was followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Expression of cell-cycle proteins (p53, p21, and p27) was assessed by immunohistochemistry in specimens retrieved from both initial and recurrent thymomas. Univariate and multivariate analysis for prognostic factors present at the time of the recurrence was performed.
From January 2004 to September 2007, the branched open stent-grafting technique was performed in 69 cases (55 men, average age 66.2 years, 36 degenerative aneurysms and 33 aortic dissections, 13 [18.8%] in emergency, 7 [10.1%] redo cases). Under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, the branched endoprosthesis was delivered through the opened proximal aortic arch, and total arch repair was completed. To avoid cerebral embolism, retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed at the end of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
An observational study aimed at analyzing transit-time flow measurements during 1:1 intra-aortic balloon pump use and during its cessation in 138 consecutive patients using intra-aortic balloon pump before coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 442 graft segments) was reported.
The study consisted of 79 consecutive patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (age 65 +/- 9 years; 81% men; ejection fraction 30% +/- 6%) and logistic European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation &gt; 10% having coronary artery bypass surgery. Myocardial viability was assessed by delayed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Left ventricular dyssynchrony was calculated using tissue Doppler from measurements of regional electromechanical coupling times in left ventricular basal segments before coronary artery bypass surgery.
Ninety patients underwent double valve surgery for active endocarditis over a 26-year period (mean age, 53 +/- 16 years; 71% male patients). Prosthetic endocarditis was seen in 32 patients. Staphylococcus species was isolated in 29%. Forty-six (51%) patients had abscesses. Surgical intervention consisted of valve repair or replacement with limited infection or radical resection, patch reconstruction, and valve replacement for abscesses. Mean follow-up was 5.9 +/- 4.7 years (range, 0-18 years) and was complete.
A total of 1735 patients received coronary artery bypass grafting using the radial artery between January 2001 and July 2007, of whom 893 received serial computed tomographic coronary angiographies; these patients formed the basis of the current study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group I (direct radial artery to aortic anastomosis, n = 451 patients) and group II (radial artery composite grafting with the left internal thoracic artery, n = 442 patients). The number of distal radial artery anastomoses performed in group I was 657 and 749 in group II. Sequential bypassing was performed in 399 patients.
We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 12 patients (mean age 28 +/- 5 years) referred for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation to treat right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit failure 11.1 +/- 3.3 years after Ross procedure.
Thirty-four Fontan patients (median age 10.4 years, range 6.8-20.7 years, 22 boys, median follow-up 7.8 years, 5.0-17.8 years) underwent electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, bicycle exercise testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) analysis.
We studied 105 Fontan patients (aged 2-24 years) with through-plane phase contrast velocity mapping to determine flow rates in the inferior and superior venae cavae and left and right pulmonary arteries. Superior caval anastomosis type included 40 bidirectional Glenn shunts (of which 15 were bilateral) and 53 hemi-Fontan anastomoses; Fontan type included 69 intra-atrial baffles, 28 extracardiac conduits, and 4 atriopulmonary connections.
One hundred seven patients were analyzed. They had a congenital diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot, had their first pulmonary valve replacement between 2002 and 2008, and had a known interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement. The median age at the time of surgical intervention was 2 years for pulmonary valve disruption (range, 0-56 years) and 26 years for pulmonary valve replacement (range, 1-72 years). The median interval was 23 years (range, 0-51 years). Potential related factors were sex, race, initial diagnosis and procedure, age at pulmonary valve disruption, prior shunt operation, presence of branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and degree of pulmonary regurgitation.
The procedure was performed through bilateral minithoracotomies with video assistance. It included bilateral pulmonary vein isolation with bipolar radiofrequency with documentation of conduction block, location of ganglionic plexi by high-frequency stimulation, and appropriate ablation and left atrial appendage exclusion/excision. Clinical follow-up at 6 months included monitoring with electrocardiogram, Holter, event monitor, or pacemaker interrogation.
In the Talent Thoracic Retrospective Registry, 180 patients were treated for acute or chronic aortic dissection (mean age: 59.6 +/- 13.0 years). Thirty-seven (20.6%) patients had acute aortic complications with signs of rupture, distal malperfusion, or persistent pain; the remainder were in stable condition. Aortic diameter was 53.5 +/- 14.3 mm, the distance from the left subclavian artery to the proximal entry tear was 44.1 +/- 41.9 mm, and dissection extended beyond the celiac axis in 88.3% of cases. Length of covered aorta measured 138.9 +/- 45.7 mm, with one stent graft used in 125 (69.4%) patients.
Between June 22, 2006, and March 22, 2007, 220 patients requiring coronary artery bypass grafting with at least 2 vein grafts were enrolled. Within each patient, 1 graft was randomly assigned to receive a PAS-Port device, and the other was assigned to receive a hand-sewn anastomosis to the ascending aorta. The primary end point was angiographic patency (&lt;50% stenosis) 9 months after surgical intervention. Secondary end points included average time to complete each anastomosis and 9-month freedom from major adverse cardiac events.
The optical properties of methylene blue were measured after dissolution in 100% serum. Biodistribution and clearance were quantified in organs and tissue after intravenous bolus injection of 2 mg/kg methylene blue in 3 rats. Coronary arteriography and cardiac perfusion were imaged in real time after intravenous bolus injection of 1 mg/kg methylene blue in 5 pigs with coronary obstructions. Coronary angiography and acute thrombi were assessed by using 800-nm fluorophores, indocyanine green, and IR-786-labeled platelets, respectively.
We induced either ischemia or edema alone in isolated cardiomyocytes and whole Langendorff-perfused hearts. Function was measured as shortening dynamics and developed pressure, respectively.
A left ventricular pressure-volume catheter was placed in 21 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (ejection fraction 29% +/- 5%). Pressure-volume loops were obtained after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass with atrial synchronous biventricular, left ventricular, and right ventricular outflow tract pacing and atrial-only stimulation at 90 beats/min.
Twenty patients undergoing elective true left open surgery were prospectively and alternately enrolled in the study to the conventional de-airing technique (pleural cavities unopened, dead space ventilation during cardiopulmonary bypass [control group]) and the new de-airing technique (pleural cavities open, ventilator disconnected during cardiopulmonary bypass, staged perfusion, and ventilation of lungs during de-airing [study group]). Transesophageal echocardiography and transcranial Doppler continually monitored the air emboli during the de-airing period and for 10 minutes after termination of the cardiopulmonary bypass.
A single-step purification method using adhesion to cell culture plastic was adopted to isolate mesenchymal stem cells from wild-type, estrogen receptor-alpha knockout, estrogen receptor-beta knockout, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 knockout mice. Mesenchymal stem cells were treated with or without 17beta-estradiol, estrogen receptor-alpha agonist (propyl pyrazoletriol), and estrogen receptor-beta agonist (diarylpropionitrile).
Septal infarction was induced in 6 sheep using ethanol delivery into the main septal perforating artery. Six shams avoided ethanol. Load-independent and in-series right ventricular response to incremental (0%-100%) left ventricular unloading was measured 4 weeks later. Dimensions of whole heart, wall thickness, and chamber volumes were obtained using sonomicrometers. Selective perfusion with triphenyltetrazolium quantified septal damage.
From June 2005 to July 2006, a total of 451 patients were given diagnoses of and treated for pulmonary tuberculosis in a university-affiliated hospital. Among them, 121 patients who received bronchoscopy because of sputum-negative conditions were recruited. Of these, 73 patients received bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography, and 48 patients received conventional bronchoscopy.
Serum and total RNA were obtained from the blood samples collected from patients with diabetes and matched patients without diabetes (n = 7 patients each) who had coronary artery bypass graft before and 6 hours and 4 days after cardiopulmonary bypass/cardioplegic arrest. The cytokine panel, consisting of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, was quantified in patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes before and 6 hours and 4 days post-cardiopulmonary bypass/cardioplegic arrest using multiplex cytokine quantification system. cDNA microarray analysis was performed and fold-change was calculated.
Included were 115 specimens of lung tissue from patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery from January 2001 to December 2002. We reviewed the clinical features of 56 smokers and 59 nonsmokers with an average follow-up of 67 months. The pathologic findings of resected lung specimens were analyzed retrospectively.
Venous blood from volunteers older than 65 years undergoing routine echocardiographic analysis or aortic valve surgery for aortic stenosis was collected. Plasma osteopontin levels were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of aortic stenosis was defined as an aortic valve area of less than 2.0 cm(2). Aortic valve calcification was assessed by using a validated echocardiographic grading system (1, none; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe). Comparisons were performed with nonpaired t tests.
The study cohort consisted of 1140 consecutive patients undergoing nonemergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Clinical details were obtained prospectively, and serum uric acid was measured a median of 1 day before surgery. The primary end point was all-cause mortality.
Sixty-seven cyanotic patients (median age 15 months, interquartile range 6-49 months) undergoing corrective cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either controlled normoxic (50-0 mm Hg; n = 35) or hyperoxic (150-180 mm Hg; n = 32) cardiopulmonary bypass. Troponin I and 8-isoprostane, C3a, interleukins 6, 8, and 10, cortisol, protein S100, and alpha-glutamate transferase were measured preoperatively and 10 and 30 minutes after starting bypass, on removal of the aortic crossclamp, and 12 and 24 hours thereafter.
The study group consisted of 68 cardiac allograft recipients (63 men and 5 women, 43 +/- 12 years old). We performed a re-evaluation of 1071 endomyocardial biopsy specimens to search for microvascular diseases and lipofuscin in cardiocytes. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens with an International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation rejection grade of 2 or more and those without arterioles were excluded. Abnormalities found in the remaining 517 specimens were correlated with the grade of rejection. Biopsy specimens obtained 2 weeks, 12 months, and 36 months after transplantation were compared with coronary angiography results, clinical events of cardiac allograft vasculopathies, and survivals. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare the time to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy or death.
Thirty-three recipients of living-donor lobar lung transplantation were divided into two groups: those with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH group; n = 12) and those without (non-PAH group; n = 21). Their systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 93.1 +/- 6.7 mm Hg versus 31.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively. Right and left ventricular ejection fractions, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac index were serially measured by radionuclide ventriculography and right heart catheterization, respectively.
Records of patients who underwent salvage with a CentriMag as bridge to decision and later to transplant were reviewed. Between June 2003 and June 2008, 4 patients in cardiogenic shock from acute decompensated end-stage heart failure and multiorgan dysfunction underwent salvage with biventricular CentriMag as bridge to decision. Three were male. Mean age was 39.3 years (range 24-52 years). Three had dilated cardiomyopathy; 1 had ischemic cardiomyopathy. All had preoperative mechanical ventilation, large doses of multiple inotropes, and intra-aortic balloon support. All also had acute liver and renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
Western blot and flow cytometry were used to determine levels of the adhesion receptor glycoprotein (GP)Ibalpha on platelets or its shed fragment glycocalicin in plasma and serum from wild-type mice, Tph1(-/-) mice lacking peripheral 5-HT, and mice lacking functional tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM17). Flow chamber experiments and intravital microscopy were used to examine the adhesive properties of platelets after stimulation of 5-HT2AR.
We studied the effects of FFP, rFVIIa and Beriplex P/N on the INR and TG, using the calibrated automated thrombography assay in ex vivo warfarinized plasma. Plasmas with different INRs were spiked with different concentrations of Beriplex P/N.
Antibodies against PF4-heparin complex were assayed by particle gel immunoassay (PaGIA), or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with or without an excess of heparin. EIA for PF4 alone was also performed. Functional assays for HIT, that is, heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) and heparin-induced platelet aggregation, were also performed.
Levels, activity, conformation and immunohistological features of antithrombin were studied in patients, cell and mice models. Because of the importance of the steroid receptor-heat stress response (HSR) axis, and the role of unfolded protein response (UPR) in conformational diseases, we also evaluated Hsp27, Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF-1 and ER chaperons (Grp78 and Grp94).
MPs were prepared from plasma by centrifugation. The procoagulant activity (PCA) of MPs was measured using a two-stage chromogenic assay. We also measured levels of thrombin-antithrombin and the number of MPs.
LAC and antibody levels were measured in 208 stroke patients and 203 age- and gender-matched control subjects.
Dynamic whole blood clot formation assessed by thromboelastometry, platelet count, thrombin generation, and the activities of von Willebrand factor, coagulation factor II, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX and FXIII were measured in 20 bleeding patients enrolled in a prospective clinical study investigating in vivo substitution of blood loss with HES up to a target level of 30%. Thromboelastometry parameters were further evaluated after ex vivo spiking experiments with fibrinogen, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), FXIII, activated recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa), fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.
Using in vitro selection, aptamer stabilization, and conjugation to a 20-kDa poly(ethylene glycol), we generated a nuclease-resistant aptamer, ARC1779, that binds to the VWF A1-domain with high affinity (K(D) approximately 2 nM). The aptamer was assessed for inhibition of VWF-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro inhibition of platelet adhesion was assessed on collagen-coated slides and injured pig aortic segments. In vivo activity was assessed in a cynomolgus monkey carotid electrical injury thrombosis model.
Degradation of rVWF was studied in vitro under moderate denaturing conditions and was monitored by multimer analysis, residual collagen binding, and immunoblot analysis. In vivo cleavage was determined by administration of rVWF to cynomolgus monkeys, rabbits and VWF-deficient mice and subsequent analysis of plasma samples by immunoblot. Plasma ADAMTS13 levels were determined with a synthetic human VWF peptide (FRETS-VWF73).
Agonist-induced GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling were assessed using aggregometry, immunoprecipitation and western blotting to determine the effects of R406 on platelet activation.
Human and murine platelets were allowed to adhere to immobilized type I monomeric collagen through alpha2beta1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma2, PLC activation, accumulation of GTP-bound Rap1b and fibrinogen binding were measured and compared.
Adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes on maximally tolerated doses of metformin, sulphonylurea, or both, were stratified by previous oral antidiabetic therapy and randomly assigned to receive additional liraglutide 1.8 mg once a day (n=233) or exenatide 10 microg twice a day (n=231) in a 26-week open-label, parallel-group, multinational (15 countries) study. The primary outcome was change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)). Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00518882.
In this double-blind, dose-escalation, phase II study, undertaken at 297 sites in 27 countries, 3491 patients stabilised after an acute coronary syndrome were stratified on the basis of investigator decision to use aspirin only (stratum 1, n=761) or aspirin plus a thienopyridine (stratum 2, n=2730). Participants were randomised within each strata and dose tier with a block randomisation method at 1:1:1 to receive either placebo or rivaroxaban (at doses 5-20 mg) given once daily or the same total daily dose given twice daily. The primary safety endpoint was clinically significant bleeding (TIMI major, TIMI minor, or requiring medical attention); the primary efficacy endpoint was death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or severe recurrent ischaemia requiring revascularisation during 6 months. Safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug; efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00402597.
35 550 women were registered with gestational trophoblastic disease in the UK (1976-2006), of whom 62 were diagnosed with placental-site trophoblastic tumours and included, retrospectively, in the study. Patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, or both. We estimated the probabilities of overall survival and survival without recurrence of disease 5 and 10 years after the date of first treatment, and calculated the association of these endpoints with prognostic factors, including time since antecedent pregnancy, serum concentration of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, and stage of disease, with both univariate and multivariate analyses.
A multicentre, randomised, open-label, active control, phase III, non-inferiority trial was done at four HAT treatment centres in the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Patients aged 15 years or older with confirmed second-stage T b gambiense infection were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive intravenous eflornithine (400 mg/kg per day, every 6 h; n=144) for 14 days or intravenous eflornithine (400 mg/kg per day, every 12 h) for 7 days with oral nifurtimox (15 mg/kg per day, every 8 h) for 10 days (NECT; n=143). The primary endpoint was cure (defined as absence of trypanosomes in body fluids and a leucocyte count &lt;/=20 cells per muL) 18 months after treatment. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat (ITT), modified ITT, and per-protocol (PP) populations. The non-inferiority margin for the difference in cure rates was defined as 10%.

One hundred and forty five patients of the University Hospital Foundation Alcorc√≥n (122 women) candidates for bariatric surgery (108 finally operated) were included in the study. A clinical interview was carried and several scales of psychopathology were applied before and after surgery: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Maudsley Obsessive-compulsive Interview (MOCI), Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Bulimic Investigation Test Edinburg (BITE), and Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). A comparison of means between the initial and final scores of the psychometric tests and a logistic regression analysis to identify the predictive variables of positive evolution after surgery (defined as percentage of lost overweight&gt; 50% and final IMC &lt;35) were performed.
All women of reproductive age residing in Asturias, Catalonia, Valencia and Madrid were included. The rates of legally induced abortion in Spanish and immigrant women were calculated in 2005. It was estimated the rate in all women in 1991 assuming that that rate refers to Spanish women only.
cTp-I was measured in consecutive patients objectively diagnosed of PE by means of pulmonary angiography made with helicoidal CT. Patients were classified radiologically as central or peripheral PE and hemodynamically as massive, submassive or non-massive according to the pulmonary vessel occluded and systolic blood pressure and ProBNP levels respectively. We checked also the delay in diagnosis (DD) and 30-days all-causes mortality rate.
We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent multisegmental spinal reconstruction and pelvic reconstruction using posterior instrumentation and free fibula vascularized bone transfer.
Cadaveric donor limbal corneal epithelial cells were cultured on denuded amniotic membranes using an explant technique that was free of serum and feeder cells in the Epilife medium containing a growth supplement of defined composition. These cells were assessed by phase contrast microscope. The expressions of the proposed corneal epithelial stem cell markers (p63, ATP-binding cassette member 2 (ABCG2), and cytokeratin 15 and 19) and differentiation markers (cytokeratin 3, 12, connexin 43, and p75) were analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemical staining.
Seventy-five POAG patients (49 women, 26 men) and 119 healthy subjects (67 women, 52 men) were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Allele and genotype frequencies between healthy subjects and glaucoma patients were compared by the chi(2) test, and intraocular pressure (IOP), cup/disc ratio (C/D) and visual field indices (MD and PSD) were compared among different APOE, p53, and p21 genotypes in POAG group. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect mRNA expression of mAChRs in the human and mouse sclera. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry were used to detect proteins of mAChRs in the cultured SFs. An immunohistochemical study was used to further detect the presence of mAChR proteins in frozen scleral sections. BrdU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ) cell proliferation assay was performed to measure DNA synthesis. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure in vitro kinase activity for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Expressions of epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R); protein kinase C (PKC); Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk-2), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-Raf), Rat Sarcoma (Ras), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2), and ERK1/2 were detected by immunoblot.

Sixty healthy participants, 48 glaucoma suspects, and 55 subjects with glaucoma.
Participants were imaged by a single trained operator using the Stratus OCT (fast RNFL scan mode) and Cirrus HD-OCT (optic disc cube mode) at the same visit.
The RNFL thickness as measured by the Stratus OCT (fast RNFL scan mode) and Cirrus HD-OCT (optic disc cube mode) was compared (paired t test). The relationship between RNFL thickness measurements of the 2 OCTs were evaluated using a Pearson correlation analysis. The presence of abnormal classification, as determined by using an internal normative data base in each machine was compared (chi-square test). The sensitivity and specificity of normative classification of 2 OCT measurements were calculated.
Observational cross-sectional study.
A total of 156 patients (226 eyes).
The IOLMaster measurements (IOLM-1) were performed before phacoemulsification and reexamined 3 months postoperatively (IOLM-2). One of the foldable acrylic IOLs (AcrySof SA60AT, SN60WF, or SN60D3, Alcon Laboratories Inc., Dallas, TX) was implanted.
The expected refraction and estimation error calculated from IOLM-1 using the SRK II, SRK/T, and Haigis formulae were compared with the residual refraction 3 months postoperatively. The power of the implanted IOL and IOLM-2 measurement data were used to re-estimate the postoperative expected refraction in pseudophakic eyes. The difference in expected refraction and estimation error between phakic and pseudophakic eyes was studied. Differences in the anterior chamber depth and axial length measured by IOLM-1 and IOLM-2 were analyzed and correlated with the estimation error.

A population-based retrospective chart review was performed for all diagnoses of macular hole between 1992 and 2002 among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota. Yearly incidence rates for each given age and sex group were determined by dividing the number of cases within that group by the estimated total Olmsted County resident population of the group for that given year.
Documented clinical diagnosis of a macular hole.
Retrospective cohort study.
The study included 157 patients with suspected TB uveitis seen over an 18-month period (August 1, 2006, to February 31, 2007) at the Singapore National Eye Center (SNEC) uveitis clinic.
We identified all cases of suspected TB uveitis in the above-mentioned time period and reviewed all medical records of the cases. Clinical findings, type of treatment instituted, response to treatment, and results of investigations such as QFT, tuberculin skin test (TST), and chest x-rays were recorded. A novel method of using treatment response to determine the presumed diagnosis of TB was used to estimate the accuracy of QFT and TST.
The positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of the investigations were estimated.
Studies of stereoacuity maturation during normal development, studies of stereoacuity outcomes after treatment for infantile and accommodative esotropia, and studies of primate models of esotropia are reviewed.
Nine myopic and 11 emmetropic children fixated a near target at a distance of 33 cm. Measures of binocular and monocular accommodation and phoria were obtained during a 20-min near task with and without +2 D lenses. Response AC/A ratios were determined from the experimental results. Vergence adaptation was quantified by the magnitude of reduction in phoria and the percentage of completeness (PC, return of adapted phoria to habitual level) after the near task.
Participants were 29 children with 59 age-matched controls (33 males and 35 females; mean age 12.4 +/- 1.8 years) and DS (9 to 16 years; 19 males and 10 females; mean age 12.8 +/- 1.9 years). Corneal curvature was measured using a hand-held keratometer. Refractive error was assessed by distance static retinoscopy in the control group and Mohindra retinoscopy in the DS group.
Sweep VEP vernier acuity, sweep VEP grating acuity, and behavioral grating acuity (measured with PL cards) were measured in 29 patients with CVI. The patients ranged in age from 3.2 to 22.7 years (mean: 12.3; SD: 5.3). Because the measures of vernier acuity and grating acuity have different units, the results were expressed as the log deficit (with normal being 30 cycles per degrees and 0.5 arc min, respectively).
The current classification of albinism, and the cutaneous, ocular, and central nervous system characteristics are presented. Recent clinical findings are summarized.
Grating acuity was assessed monocularly in 45 patients with unilateral amblyopia, 44 patients at risk for amblyopia, and 37 children with no known vision disorders. Each child's grating acuity was classified as normal/abnormal based on age-appropriate norms. These classifications were compared with formal amblyopia diagnoses.
Thirty-one VGB patients and 10 control subjects, median age 6 years, were recruited. Visual field extent on the major oblique meridia was tested with a 6 degrees white sphere and WSKP, a method used by Quinn et al. to study field extent in children with retinopathy of prematurity. The same meridia were tested using Goldmann kinetic perimetry (GKP; 1.7 degrees target) in those who were capable. Monocular and binocular tests were conducted. Visual field extent for WSKP and GKP were compared in VGB patients and control subjects.
Subjects were 49 children, aged 8 to 15 years. Subjects wore habitual correction over their left eye and an infrared filter over the right eye during accommodative measurements. Monocular accommodation was measured continuously for two, 30-second periods using a PowerRef I at a sampling rate of 25 Hz while subjects viewed a high-contrast target at 0.25 m. The high (1.0 to 2.3 Hz) and low- (0 to 0.6 Hz) frequency components of the power spectrum from a fast Fourier transform of the accommodative response were used in analysis. Resting tension on the crystalline lens was assessed by measuring the amplitude of the oscillations of the crystalline lens after a rightward 20 degrees saccadic eye movement. Ciliary body thickness was measured 2 mm posterior to the scleral spur from images obtained with a Zeiss Visante optical coherence tomography (OCT). Cycloplegic spherical equivalent refractive error was obtained with the Grand Seiko autorefractor.
Subjects were recruited from visitors at Glasgow Science Centre. One hundred thirty-five healthy children and young adults were tested (range: 5-22 years). After a comprehensive visual screening to establish normal visual function, all three subtests of the UFOV (1: Processing Speed; 2: Divided Attention; 3: Selective Attention) were performed. RESULTS.: All the children were able to understand and complete all subtests. UFOV scores improved monotonically with age, for all subtests, throughout the primary school years, with subtest 3 showing the greatest improvement. By age 14, UFOV scores had reached adult levels.
Accommodative responses were measured in 101 subjects (3 to 40 years) with at least 10 subjects in each 5-year age bin. Subjects monocularly viewed a high-contrast target at 33.3 cm on the near-point rod of the Grand Seiko autorefractor. Measurements of refraction were taken as the subject viewed the target. Accommodative lag was defined as the difference between demand and measured response. Four additional demands were tested by introducing minus lenses [-1 to -4 diopter (D)] in the spectacle plane of the viewing eye. Maximum accommodative amplitudes were determined by presenting additional lenses until the measured response plateaued or peaked. Accommodative demands and responses were adjusted to the corneal plane. RESULTS.: Accommodative lag showed a significant linear decrease with age for subjects 3 to 20 years for each of the first four demands (3 D, 3.92 D, 4.80 D, 5.67 D, p &lt;or= 0.013) and approached significance for the largest demand (6.52 D, p = 0.053). For the entire group, accommodative lag increased with increasing stimulus demand, with the largest increase occurring for subjects aged 30 to 40 years as stimulus demands approached the subjects' maximum amplitude. For subjects aged 3 to 20 years, multilevel modeling analysis revealed a significant relationship between age and lag (p &lt; 0.0001) and a significant relationship between maximum amplitude and the increase in lag per unit increase in stimulus demand (p = 0.0032).
One hundred fifty-eight children aged 8 to 11 years completed the DEM test and a battery of eye movement tasks, recorded by a Microguide 1000 infrared eye tracker. All subjects completed a symptomatology survey. Reading performance and visual processing data was collected for 77 and 75 children, respectively.
Defocus at distance and near (57 cm) was assessed using Mohindra and dynamic retinoscopy, respectively, in 262 normal birthweight infants at 3, 9, and 18 months of age. Preferential looking provided acuity data at the same ages. The spherical equivalent refractive error was measured by cycloplegic retinoscopy (cyclopentolate 1%).
Participants were 29 infants from 15 to 28 weeks of age, two children, one adolescent, and nine adults. Visual evoked potentials were elicited by horizontal square-wave gratings contrast-reversed at 7.5 Hz. Spatial frequencies of 0.75 and 1.5 cpd were used, and contrast was swept in seven octave steps from 1 to 64% with an initial step at 0%. There were 10 runs of each condition (8.5 s each). Fourier analysis was used to derive amplitude and phase of the dominant (second harmonic) frequency component in the response, which were then plotted vs. contrast. The empirical contrast response functions were fitted using a nonlinear model, which generates estimates of shunting inhibition, conductance, and the integrative time constant in the system.
Tests were constructed in the form of the Farnsworth-Munsell style of arrangement test with constant intervals of metric lightness (CIE L*). Four intervals (DeltaL* = 15, 10, 5, and 3) were used. The child was instructed to arrange the colors from darker to lighter (or vice versa).
Eye movements were assessed with the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test, in a group of children with amblyopia (n = 39; age, 9.1 +/- 0.9 years) of different causes (infantile esotropia, n = 7; acquired strabismus, n = 10; anisometropia, n = 8; mixed, n = 8; deprivation, n = 6) and in an age-matched control group (n = 42; age, 9.3 +/- 0.4 years). LogMAR visual acuity (VA), stereoacuity, and refractive error were also recorded in both groups.
Two hundred thirty-six normal subjects, ranging in age from 0.25- to 78-years old, participated in the study. Global hyperacuity (detection threshold for radial deformation) was obtained from 300 eyes using either a computerized testing or a chart testing protocol and spatial forced choice (preferential looking for &lt;2.6-year old, pointing for young children, or verbal response for older children and adults). Resolution acuity was also measured. The developmental courses for global hyperacuity and resolution acuity were fit to a 3-segment curve to capture the initial rapid development, followed by a period of stable, adult-level visual function and, finally, the decline in visual function with aging.
In a population-based cohort of children in the Multi-Ethnic Pediatric Eye Disease Study, monocular HOTV VA measurements using the Amblyopia Treatment Study protocol were analyzed using continuous and dichotomous outcomes for VA and IOD, after excluding subjects with ophthalmic abnormalities or refractive error.

Amphibinase analogues were encapsulated in poly(ricinoleic-co-sebacic acid) formulations using mix-melt technology and loaded onto surgical foam. In-vitro release was monitored by BCA colorimetry and by RNAse specific bioactivity. The implants were inserted into rat brains bearing 9L glioma to assess toxicity and efficacy.
h-IFN was administered at a dose of 5 million IU/kg. For some experiments, tacrolimus was also either subcutaneously or intravenously injected in rats at a dose of 0.001 or 0.5 mg/kg as well as with administration of h-IFN.
The distribution volume of the terminal phase (Vd(beta)) in humans was predicted by three methods using animal pharmacokinetic data. Then, total body clearance (CL(tot)) was calculated by multiplying the elimination rate constant and Vd(beta), and the BA was calculated as a ratio between CL(tot) and oral clearance. The predicted and observed values were compared for 67 drugs for which pharmacokinetic data after intravenous administration in humans were available.

The precipitation of piroxicam and cinnarizine formulated in these excipients during the gastrointestinal lipolysis was also studied.
The sub-cellular localization of coumarin-6 labeled chitosan/GMO nanostructures was determined by confocal microscopy in MDA-MB-231 cells. The antitumor efficacy was evaluated in two separate studies using FOX-Chase (CB17) SCID Female-Mice MDA-MB-231 xenograph model. Treatments consisted of intravenous Taxol or chitosan/GMO nanostructures with or without PTX, local intra-tumor bolus of Taxol or chitosan/GMO nanostructures with or without PTX. The tumor diameter and animal weight was monitored at various intervals. Histopathological changes were evaluated in end-point tumors.
Data from 41 subjects receiving cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin were used to develop the ANC model consisting of a drug-sensitive progenitor cell compartment, linked to the peripheral blood compartment, through three transition compartments. PBSC were incorporated into the first transit compartment following a zero-order process, k(in), and the rebound effect was explained by a feedback mechanism. A 'kinetics of drug action' model was used to quantify the HDC effect on the progenitor cells according to a linear function, with a slope (alpha).
Simulations based on a pharmacokinetic model developed to describe fexofenadine disposition in humans were conducted to examine the impact of altered hepatobiliary transport on fexofenadine disposition. The effect of GF120918 on fexofenadine disposition was evaluated in human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). Additionally, the effect of GF120918, bosentan, and taurocholate on fexofenadine disposition in perfused livers from TR(-) Wistar rats was examined.
Biotinylated polyethyleneimine/avidin bioconjugate (ABP) was synthesized through grafting biotin to high molecular weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI, 25 kDa) and then bioconjugating with avidin by the biotin-avidin interaction.

In vitro release was assessed using fluorescent-tagged stratifin, cytotoxicity by MTT assay and bioactivity by measuring the levels of MMP-1 expression in cultured fibroblasts.
The divalent cationic salts, calcium chloride and manganese chloride, previously shown to disrupt peptide sorption, were introduced in PLGA microspheres prepared by the double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Peptide stability was monitored by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and identified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) during microsphere degradation under physiological conditions for 4 weeks. Microsphere morphology and salt content were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), respectively.
The central pharmacy at the Percy French military hospital (France).
The check of the unit dose medication cassettes was performed by pharmacists to identify dispensing errors before delivering to the care units. From April 2006 to December 2006, detected errors were corrected and recorded into seven categories: unauthorized drug, wrong dosage-form, improper dose, omission, wrong time, deteriorated drug, and wrong patient errors.
Dispensing error rate, calculated by dividing the total of detected errors by the total of filled and omitted doses; classification of recorded dispensing errors.
Pharmacy practice in Australia.
A psychometric instrument, the Professional Ethics in Pharmacy (PEP) test, was developed and validated following a systematic procedure. The theoretical foundation of the instrument was based on a hypothesised theory of cognitive moral development in professional ethics, which was integrated into a selection of scenarios experienced in practice by pharmacists in NSW, Australia. The PEP, along with the well established DIT test, was mailed in the form of a questionnaire to a randomly selected sample of 1,500 practising pharmacists. Data collected from returned questionnaires were statistically analysed to establish validity and reliability of the instrument.
The P-score calculated for each participant from DIT and PEP data and defined as a measure of principled moral reasoning, represented the main outcome measure for statistical testing. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the strength of the relationship of the PEP with the DIT (regarded as the "gold standard") in order to establish criterion and concurrent validity. Factor analysis was used to investigate construct validity. Cronbach's Alpha, a measure of reliability of the instrument, was used for indicating internal consistency. Linear regression models further investigated construct validity in relation to predictors of moral reasoning.
Data were gathered from an anonymous postal questionnaire survey of patients purchasing OTC medicines in a random sample of Flemish community pharmacies in April 2008. The self-administered questionnaire related to the most recent purchase of OTC medicines by a patient in a community pharmacy. The questionnaire included questions about: (a) sources of information about OTC medicines; (b) the patient relationship with pharmacist and physician; (c) organization and layout of the pharmacy; (d) distribution channels; and (e) patient satisfaction. Questions were generally measured using Likert scales. The questionnaire was piloted among patients.
A drug-oriented prospective observational study was performed. Physicians filled in clinical observation forms with detailed information of the patients including general information, drug information, therapeutic effects and adverse drug events. The adverse drug reaction factors were analyzed by both mono-factor and multiple-factor logistic regression methods.
Fourteen questions with a 5-item likert-scale from "never" (4) to "very often" (0) were given to 150 medical inpatients. According to their score, patients were classified into non-adherent (score &lt;50) or adherent (score 50-56). On the dichotomous MMAS, "yes" is scored 0 and "no" 1 point, a total score of 4 indicating adherence. Patients with complete scales were compared with the remaining patients regarding socio-demographic factors. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's Alpha, Spearman correlation, and kappa were computed.
Three observers performed a visual estimation of weight in 71 geriatric patients. Estimated body weights from each observer were compared to measured body weights. Various panels--three panels of two observers and two panels of three observers--were also evaluated.
University hospital providing primary and tertiary care.
Using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes we allocated to drug specifying ICD-10 codes (i.e. Z88) all drugs belonging to the same group of compounds or those known to induce cross-allergy. In a randomly selected cohort of 200 in-patients we then assessed documentation and coding of drug allergies and incident prescribing errors ignoring patients' drug allergies.

A cross-sectional design was used. The study group consisted of pregnant women at 16 gestational weeks or more referred to our ultrasound unit for amniocentesis. Amniotic fluid was assayed for levels of GGT and other hepatobiliary enzymes using the Integra 800 device. The 5th and 95th percentiles for each gestational week were calculated.
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from pregnant women with and without pre-eclampsia. Cellular RNA was subjected to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in order to examine the mRNA distribution among women with pre-eclampsia (n = 24) and control subjects (n = 24) during 35-41 weeks of gestation. The data were analyzed by non-parametric statistics.
Peripheral blood samples were collected from 220 women and from members of five families with proven HA. One-tube fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis were performed to investigate four short tandem repeats (STRs) in intron 1, 13, 22 and 24 (STR1, STR13, STR22 and STR24, respectively) in FVIII.
All 25-55-year-old, non-self-employed, Korean workers who were diagnosed with cancer for the first time in 2001 were identified as first baseline study subjects (n=4991). Of these, those who lost their jobs within 1 year of cancer diagnosis were selected as second baseline subjects (n=1334). Sex- and age-matched cancer-free individuals from the general population were used as a reference group. We compared the time until job loss from the first baseline and the time until re-employment from the second baseline between these two groups during the 5-6-year follow-up period while adjusting for sex, age group, job-type, and equivalent household income using the National Health Insurance administrative database.
Electronic searches were conducted in four databases. Studies were included only if they were exclusively designed for adolescent cancer patients and incorporated a defined outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the implemented intervention.
This study was based on the 2006 Korean National Cancer Screening Survey conducted by the National Cancer Center, in which trained interviewers met face-to-face with participants selected by a nationally representative random sampling. The participants included 1673 adults, aged 40 years or older, who had not previously been diagnosed with cancer. Simple and multiple ordinal regression were used to determine the associations between perceived risk and socio-demographic, lifestyle, health, and psychological factors.

Drug-na√Øve rhesus monkeys were provided limited access (1 h) to cocaine self-administration for 60 days followed by 60 days under an extended access condition (4 h). Basal levels of striatal extracellular dopamine and its metabolites, as well as the effectiveness of cocaine and amphetamine to elevate dopamine, were determined with in vivo microdialysis before the initiation of cocaine self-administration and during limited and extended access. The effect of cocaine and amphetamine on the acoustic startle response was also examined to assess complementary behavioral changes as a function of drug history.
Separate groups of rats were trained for 26 days on either a probabilistic (risk) or effort-discounting task, each consisting of four discrete blocks of ten choice trials. One lever always delivered a smaller reward (one or two pellets), whereas another lever delivered a four-pellet reward. For risk-discounting, the probability of receiving the larger reward decreased across trial blocks (100-12.5%), whereas on the effort task, four pellets could be obtained after a ratio of presses that increased across blocks (2-20). After training, rats received 15 saline or AMPH injections (escalating from 1 to 5 mg/kg) and were then retested during acute and long-term withdrawal.
In this study, we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the mood state of healthy females undergoing ATD (or balanced placebo) on two separate testing sessions. On the first session, subjects received either negative or neutral mood induction, while on the second session all subjects received neutral mood induction.
After hospitalization, the patients (n = 128) were given a 4-week course of aripiprazole. Patients were genotyped for HTR2A A-1438G/T102C polymorphisms via the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Clinical factors such as gender, age, duration of illness, education level, diagnostic subtype, and medication dosage were noted as well. The researchers measured psychopathology biweekly, using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). A mixed model regression approach (SAS Proc MIXED) was used to analyze the effects of genetic and clinical factors on PANSS performance after aripiprazole treatment.
Procedures for use with juvenile rats at postnatal day (PND) 21 and 28 were adapted from the adult learned helplessness model in which, 24 h after exposure to inescapable stress, animals are unable to remove themselves from an easily escapable stressor. Rats were treated for 7 days with either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram at 10 mg/kg or the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine at 3, 10, or 15 mg/kg to determine if treatment could decrease escape latency times.

The behavioral effects of MDMA, with and without serotonergic or dopaminergic pretreatments, were studied in squirrel monkeys trained to respond under a fixed-interval schedule of stimulus termination; effects on caudate dopamine levels were studied in a separate group of squirrel monkeys using in vivo microdialysis. Positron emission tomography neuroimaging with the dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand [18F]FECNT was used to determine DAT occupancy by MDMA in rhesus monkeys.
The effects of acute and repeated treatment with the potent, selective Sig-1R antagonist NE-100 on ethanol intake (10%) were studied in adult, male Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats, a model of genetic predisposition to high ethanol drinking. To assess the specificity of action, the acute effects of NE-100 on intake of an equally preferred sucrose solution and of a higher concentration of ethanol that sP rats did not prefer over water (28%), were determined. Finally, the ability of NE-100 administration to prevent the increased ethanol intake that occurs after deprivation was evaluated.

We studied the medical population in the east part of France by sending a questionnaire to each of 460 medical correspondents. This questionnaire attempted to evaluate the respondent's level of medical knowledge, their personal opinion with respect to first-trimester screening and their attitude towards their patients. We adapted the three-dimensional diagram designed by Marteau et al. to develop a measure of informed choice regarding screening. Only health professionals who were relatively well informed and adopted an autonomy-oriented approach were considered to be in a position to obtain true consent from their patients, respecting ethical principles in terms of competence and the autonomy of patients.
Two hundred and eighty-seven women underwent transvaginal ultrasound examination 6-9 months after delivery: 108 had undergone one Cesarean section, 43 had had two Cesarean sections, 11 had undergone at least three Cesarean sections, and 125 were primiparae who had delivered vaginally. The ultrasound examiner was blinded to the obstetric history until all scans had been evaluated.
This was a national registry-based cohort study, including all singleton pregnant women who had an amniocentesis (n = 32 852) or CVS (n = 31 355) in Denmark between 1996 and 2006. Personal registration numbers of women having had an amniocentesis or a CVS were retrieved from the Danish Central Cytogenetic Registry, and cross-linked with the National Registry of Patients to determine the outcome of each pregnancy. Postprocedural fetal loss rate was defined as miscarriage or intrauterine demise before 24 weeks of gestation.
We pooled data from two multicenter medical abortion trials involving 2208 women who received mifepristone orally followed by misoprostol vaginally. Women returned for transvaginal ultrasonography approximately 7 days later. The endometrial thickness was measured if no gestational sac was present. Final status was confirmed by a phone interview at 5 weeks. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the overall ability of endometrial thickness to predict the need for subsequent D&amp;C. Endometrial thickness was dichotomized using threshold values at 5-mm increments from 10 to 30 mm. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the ability of each endometrial thickness threshold value to predict subsequent D&amp;C. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to adjust endometrial thickness values for study, treatment group, and study site.

All patients were randomized into 3 groups: Pringle maneuver was applied in Group 1 (n=40), hemihepatic inflow control was Group 2 (n=30) and complete hemihepatic vascular occlusion with hanging maneuver was applied in Group 3 (n=24).The clamping period, operation time, bleeding volume, blood transfusion volume, postoperative recovery of liver function and postoperative complications were compared among three groups.
We examined the demographics, surgical records and outcome in 9 patients undergoing LAPH between 2001 and 2007 by comparing results in 15 patients (control group) who did not undergo laparoscopy before 2000.
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were enrolled in three groups. Group 1: Signs and symptoms of peritonitis plus a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count of ascitic fluid equal or greater than 250/mm3. Group 2: Signs and symptoms of peritonitis, but polymorphonuclear leukocyte count of ascitic fluid less than 250/mm3. Group 3: No signs and symptoms of peritonitis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count of ascitic fluid less than 250/mm3. Ceftriaxone was started in Groups 1 and 2. Serum level of hsCRP was repeated after the 2nd day of the antibacterial treatment.
Case-control study in a medical-surgical ICU of a referral hospital. Patients admitted to ICU with severe acute liver failure of any etiology were included. Conventional treatment was applied in all cases according to patient's clinical condition. Patients were treated with MARS after the implementation of this therapy in the ICU. Patients without this treatment were the control group.
One hundrend seven patients with chronic Hepatitis C (genotype 1) were treated with pegylated-interferon 2alpha/ribavirin for 48 weeks. Quantitative testing of liver function, including aminopyrine breath test (ABT), galactose elimination capacity (GEC), sorbitol clearance (SCl) and indocyanine green clearance (ICG) was performed before and 12 weeks after initiation of antiviral therapy. QTLF was repeated at the end of the therapy (week 48) and 6 months after therapy.
Among 863 acute hepatitis patients admitted consecutively to the hospital, 320 with serum immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen were classified as acute hepatitis B. Of these patients, serum samples were collected 3 and 6 months after clinical onset.
Partial hepatic ischemia was maintained for 60 min in a pig. Pigs were allocated to 4 groups (n=5 each): (1) Control group with I-R injury (Vehicle); (2) EPO group with I-R injury, given three injections of EPO at 5000 IU/kg (EPO5000x3); (3) EPO group with I-R injury, given a single injection of EPO at 5000 IU/kg (EPO5000x1); and (4) EPO group with I-R injury, given three injections of EPO at 500 IU/kg (EPO500x3). Liver function tests (AST, ALT, LDH), and TUNEL assay were performed.
Twenty-three patients with LN metastases from HCC underwent RT. A daily dose of 1.8-4 Gy was administered to deliver a total dose of 28-56 Gy, which was a biologic effective dose (BED) of 36-67.2 Gy10 (median 58.5 Gy10) with an alpha/beta ratio of 10. We evaluated predictive factors for local control and survival.
Growth inhibition of hepatic cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, Alexander, and HuH-7) was examined by MTT assay. On apoptosis induction, flow cytometry analyses were performed after Fas or TNF-alpha ligand stimulation followed by phosphatidylcholine. Expressions of caspase-8, -3 and PARP after phosphatidylcholine stimulation were examined by immunoblotting. TUNEL staining was also performed after phosphatidylcholine stimulation.
The time-course change in blood cell counts was compared between chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 1b receiving PEG-IFN alpha-2a/ribavirin and PEG-IFN alpha-2b/ribavirin combination therapy. The comparison was made after matching patients from the two groups based on ribavirin apparent clearance (CL/F), a surrogate marker of the steady state blood ribavirin level, in order to eliminate the effect of ribavirin. Fifteen pairs of matched patients were selected.
The results of 56 patients subjected to SPD for bleeding esophageal varices, were retrospectively reviewed. Etiology of portal hypertension was chronic HBV cirrhosis in 80.4% (45/56), alcoholic in 12.5% (7/56) and others 7.1% (4/56). Child-Pugh grading on admission was A: 78.6% (44/56), B: 14.3% (8/56), and C: 7.1% (4/56). Evaluation was made in terms of effectiveness in controlling the acute bleeding, postoperative morbidity and mortality, recurrent bleeding, encephalopathy and 3-year survival rate.
Forty-two surgical specimens resected from patients with a diagnosis of branch-type IPMN were pathologically classified as benign (n=26), which included hyperplasia and adenoma, or malignant (n=16), including moderate dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. It was compared the differences in the sizes of the tumor and main pancreatic duct (MPD) and the presence of mural nodules on CT between the groups.
The association between pancreatic fistula formation and various clinical parameters was investigated in 100 patients who underwent PD at Kochi Medical School from April 1999 through December 2007.

SPT was conducted before treatment in all the subjects, and in 6 patients each with GU and EGC after treatment- proton pump inhibitor for GU and endoscopic mucosal resection for EGC. Diagnostic values were calculated based on cut-off values estimated from the ROC curves.
Among the patients with genetically determined enzymopathies 3 patients had aminoacidopathies, and 11 had different types of encephalopathies, from which 10 had mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (MEMP), and 1 patient had hyperuricaemic encephalopathy. Besides the mentioned 14 patients, 1 had ceroid lipofuscinosis and another patient had tuberous sclerosis. The further distribution of the MEMP patients' group was the following--5 patients had MEMP with lactic acidosis, 5 had Leigh's disease (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy), from which 1 had cytochrome-c-oxidase deficiency (COX). Additionally in all patients were performed cerebral MRI and SPECT examination 10 min. after intravenous administration of 20 Mbq/kg 99 mTc-HMPAO.
Neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) between January 2001 and December 2006 were included in this study. Patients were divided into early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis groups if their culture tested positive within the first 7 days of life or later, respectively.
We searched medical records for all patients with scrub typhus who were hospitalized between 1992 and 2002 at the Taitung branch of Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Records of children under the age of 18 with a confirmed diagnosis were selected for retrospective review.
A series of anthropometric measurements, imaging, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and endocrine investigations to assess metabolic complications such as hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia were performed on these five patients who were followed for 1-7 years. Screening of inborn errors, karyotyping, chromosomal breakage rates and DNA mutational studies with direct sequencing of LMNA, ERCC8 and ZMPSTE24 genes were also performed.
In total, between July 2005 and June 2006, 36 VLBW preterm babies were admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit and were randomly allocated to the "restrictive" (n= 19) or "liberal" (n= 17) criteria for PRBC transfusion. Complete blood count (CBC) was examined at admission and 30 days later. Reticulocyte counts, serum iron and ferritin were examined and compared with the clinical outcomes.
Pyloric length, diameter, muscle thickness and intermuscular space were measured sonographically at diagnosis and daily after pyloromyotomy until discharge in 12 infants with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The ratios of pyloric wall thickness and intermuscular space to the entire pyloric diameter were measured.
Pigs were subjected to total pancreatectomy with simultaneous splenectomy and without removal of the duodenum. The collected pancreas was stored in the University of Wisconsin solution with the addition of pentoxifylline (PTX) until the isolation procedure (&lt;4 hours). Efficacy of isolation was evaluated based on the number, quality and viability of obtained islets. Following autotransplantation into the liver, secretory activity of the islets was assessed intravitally by serum glucose monitoring.
Eleven clinically stable patients were enrolled in the study (5 women and 6 men; mean age, 50.4 +/- 18.3 years), treated with PD for 26.9 +/- 22.4 months. Water transperitoneal transport was evaluated using a modified version of Babb-Randerson-Farrell thermodynamic model of membrane transport with human albumin marked with iodine as the marker of intraperitoneal volume. Based on blood and dialysate samples collected during the 16-hour dialysis exchange, the intraperitoneal volume of dialysate and dialysate reverse absorption were calculated.
Langerhans islets were isolated from rats and pigs and immunoisolated by encapsulation in alginate-protamine-heparin (APH) or alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA) membranes. Islets were pooled in a controlled manner. Tests for cryopreservation and biocompatibility were also performed.
Performance was evaluated quantitatively as the number of publications in 125 journals indexed as 'oncological' by Journal Citation Reports and qualitatively as the total impact factor (TIF). Number of publications and TIF were adjusted for the population and gross domestic product (GDP) of each country. The Scopus database was used as publication source.
We derived annual numbers of incident cases combining mortality data provided by the World Health Organization and information on relative survival from kidney cancer and we subsequently derived 5-year prevalence by combining incidence with information on survival. We provided different projection estimates for the years 2007 and 2012 for incidence and prevalence, on the basis of various hypothetical scenarios, i.e., stable rates over time or steady falls by 1% per year.
Data from the Italian Network of Cancer Registries were used to estimate the annual number of new cervical cancer cases. To assess the management costs, a typical management pathway for each FIGO (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Gyn√©cologie et d'Obst√©trique) cervical cancer stage was derived from published guidelines. Data from the Modena Cancer Registry were used to estimate the proportion of patients by FIGO stage. This algorithm was combined with tariffs for outpatient and inpatient procedures to obtain a mean cost for each FIGO stage.
The system of calculation used as variables prognostic factors of breast cancer: pathologic size, tumor type and nuclear grade, lymphovascular invasion, multifocality, estrogen receptor status, method of detection of the sentinel lymph nodes metastases (frozen section, serial hematoxylin-eosin, routine hematoxylin-eosin, and immunohistochemistry), number of positive and number of negative sentinel lymph nodes.

One hundred and four patients with stage T1b-T3b prostate cancer were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 74 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction. Rigid dose constraints were applied for rectum and bladder. Acute and late rectal and urinary toxicities were analyzed also in relation to dose-volume histograms. Biochemical relapse-free survival was defined according to the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) criteria and to the RTOG-ASTRO Phoenix Consensus Conference Recommendations using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The CNAO will be a center capable of using both protons and carbon ions. In the first phase, three rooms with vertical and horizontal fixed beams will be available, subsequently the center will be upgraded with two more rooms equipped with a rotating gantry. The facility will use active scanning delivery systems and state-of-the-art immobilization and setup verification devices. One additional room will be devoted to physical and radiobiological research. The CNAO will be a high-patient-throughput facility capable of treating more than 3,000 patients per year. Seven areas of interest have been identified: lung cancer, liver cancer, head and neck malignancies, pediatric solid cancers, eye tumors, sarcoma and central nervous system cancers. A disease-specific working group has been created for each area and has defined selection criteria and protocols to be used at the CNAO. Two more working groups are being set up on gynecological and digestive (pancreas, biliary tract and rectum) tumors. All the patients will participate in clinical trials to establish with sound evidence the real indications for hadron therapy. National and international cooperation networks are being set up to facilitate patient referral and follow-up. A medical service is already operative to assist patients and in selected case to refer them abroad.
In 6 patients, PET/CT scans with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose were performed before (PET0), during (PET1; at a median of 14 days before the end of radiotherapy) and after the end of radiotherapy (PET2 and PET3, at a median of 28 and 93 days, respectively). The metabolic response was scored according to visual and semiquantitative criteria.
Data from 60 patients with cervical lymph node metastases of squamous cell carcinoma from an unknown primary site were reviewed. Nine of 60 patients (15.0%) received excisional biopsy. Radiotherapy was delivered to the bilateral neck and pharyngeal mucosa (extensive field) in 11 patients (18.3%), to the bilateral neck in 24 patients (40.0%), and to the ipsilateral neck in 25 patients (41.7%). Fourteen patients (23.3%) also received chemotherapy.
Forty-one patients were analyzed. All patients received radiotherapy (2 Gy daily fractionation dose, median 60 Gy total doses) and concomitant temozolomide (at a daily dose of 75 mg/m2/day, 7 days per week) after surgery. Thirty-one patients received an average of 6 cycles (range, 1-8 cycles) of adjuvant temozolomide after radiotherapy, every 28 days for 5 days at a dose of 200 mg/m2/day. The primary end point was overall survival.
A total of 36 patients was treated with radiotherapy after partial laryngectomy at the Radiotherapy Department of the Institute for Cancer Treatment and Research (IRCC) of Candiolo and of the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, between 1994 and 2007. The postoperative treatment doses ranged from 45 to 70.2 Gy with conventional fractionation. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied for statistical analysis. The RTOG-EORTC scale was used to evaluate late and acute toxicity.
Fifty-seven patients who met the inclusion criteria of our study were evaluated. The characteristics (age, menopausal status, histological subtype, tumor grade, presence of ascites at diagnosis, type of omentectomy, FIGO stage, and residual tumor volume after primary surgery) of patients with and those without tumor recurrence were compared.
The study group consisted of 112 patients who had undergone all treatment at a single institution under the care of a multidisciplinary breast team. Following surgery, all patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and hormone therapy. At the time of this study all patients were disease free with at least 2 years' follow-up. Twenty percent of the patients were premenopausal and 80% postmenopausal. The patients completed a questionnaire consisting of 42 questions related to their sexual relations and body image.
The pharmacoeconomic evaluation was based on a decision-analytic model taking into account the possible consequences of FN (e.g., death and reduction/delay of chemotherapy dose). Parameters included in the model were relative risk of FN with pegfilgrastim versus six-day filgrastim; direct costs (drug purchase and FN-related hospitalizations); relative risk of relative dose intensity &lt; 85% with pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim; impact on long-term survival due to relative dose intensity &lt; 85%; and impact of age on FN and relative dose intensity &lt; 85%.
The rats were divided into two groups, a control group (n = 70) and a chemoprevention group (n = 70). Breast tumors were induced in both groups by administration of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA). The chemoprevention group also received alpha-tocopherol and a solution of micronutrients containing ascorbic acid and selenium. Neoplastic lesions of both groups were randomly selected for immunohistochemical assessment of the expression of GLUT-1, transglutaminase 2 and claudin-1.
We present a patient with two independent giant basal cell carcinomas over the left clavicle and the lower back, measuring 7 x 12 cm and 18 x 20 cm, respectively. Both tumors were excised incompletely (R2) and the patient refused followup resections. After 52 and 16 months, respectively, no signs of recurrence were observed. CONCLUSION; Incompletely excised giant basal cell carcinomas can regress spontaneously. A watch-and-wait approach after incomplete resection may be pragmatic to avoid mutilating follow-up resections in patients refusing further surgery.
The publications used as information sources were obtained from structured data search in electronic databases, such as CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials) and MEDLINE (online). Each item of this guideline derived from an original question which was distributed to the participants. Search strategies were prepared to select the studies presenting the best methodological quality, according to predefined levels of evidence.
A retrospective study was performed in a cohort of 250 patients that did not undergo screening and diagnosis in clinical practice of localized CaP (T1c-T2cNxM0). All patients were treated with radical prostatectomy between 2001 and 2008. Data about clinical and pathological findings, and also the existence of dyslipemia as well as treatment with statins for at least 5 years was collected and analyzed. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent predictive variables related with a more favorable pathology.
In our study, we analysed a group of 16 patients submitted to TURP pre-brachytherapy. The mean quality of life score from ICSmaleSF questionnaire ranged from 0 to 1 before and after brachytheraphy (average: 0,18 -- before; average: 0,20 -- after). There was no estatistically significant difference between the former values (p&lt;0,001). After brachytherapy patients were evaluated for lower urinary tract symptoms. The time interval between TURP and brachytherapy ranged from 30 to 90 days (average: 60 days). Post-brachytherapy follow-up varied between 3 and 60 months (average: 30 months).
A systematic review of the recent literature on the diagnosis and treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer was performed. The guidelines were updated and the level of evidence and grade of recommendation were assigned.
[corrected] Fifteen patients with renal tumor and IVC thrombus, underwent radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy, and were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were followed for 0 to 36 months (mean of 9.5 months). Computed tomography (CT) scan with three-dimensional reconstruction was used to define IVC thrombus level.
Retrospective study of 80 cases of patients that were operated between 2005-2008; all of them went under radical prostatectomy and were treated with sildenafil 100 mg every second day (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) plus 100 mg on demand after the surgery. As objective measurements, we used validated questionnaire IIEF-5 and also axil penile rigidity before and after surgery in the third and ninth month.

Systematic review of the literature and application of the skills of metaanalisis to value the efficiency of the DHEA/S, for it settles down the process of prospective form, 152 articles were checked and 25 were in use for adding only their results.
From December 2004 to March 2007, a total of 34 patients with posterior defect grade III or higher underwent this procedure. The minimum follow up was 13 months Mean age was 63 years. The site of fixation was the Sacrospinous ligament.
The ischiorectal fossa is dissected. Next two small skin incisions are made 3 cm lateral and inferior to the center of the anus. A proper needle is introduced, vertically towards the sacrospinal ligament at the level of the ischial spine, guided by the surgeon index finger, 2 cm medially avoiding the Alcok canal. The armpit of the mesh is connected to the tip of the needle and brought to the perineal region. No site specific correction is made.
This is an epidemiologic, cross-sectional and multicenter study. HRQoL of 1,100 women with mixed UI was evaluated using the Spanish version of "King's Health Questionnaire" (KHQ). Personal data of patients were also collected along with medical records and clinical data related to diagnostic and treatment of UI.
A retrospective study was conducted, reviewing the clinical charts of 43 patients admitted to the San Vicente of Paul Hospital, with diagnosis of traumatic rupture of the posterior urethra from 1987 to 2007. We analyzed different demographic data, type of surgical correction, early and late complications.
It's a retrospective study of 16 infants treated in our hospital. The average follow-up after the intervention is 27.4 +/- 10.0 months. The diagnostic protocol included abdominal ultrasound, cystogram and diuretic renography. The treatment was realized by endourology retrograde balloon dilatation under fluoroscopy. The balloons were in all the cases semicompliant, with a profile of 5 mm, 6 mm 6 7 mm. After the expansion there was placed stents type double J with profile and length depending on the weight of the patient. To obtain the results, we do ultrasound scans and diuretic renography at least 1 year after the intervention.
Descriptive study of 54 patients (37 men and 17 women), with lithiasic pathology at high risk of recurrence. The metabolic study included the measurement of calcemia, uricemia, fosfemia, parathormone, calciuria/24 h, uricosuria/24 h, fosfaturia/24 h, oxalaturia/24 h, citraturia/24 h and creatinine/24 h. The values obtained were corrected according to weight and creatinine. The test used for statistical analysis was t-student (STATA 7.0). It was considered significant p&lt;0.05.
The two cases of extraperitoneal bladder rupture here presented, demonstrate the difficulties of a secure diagnosis by CT, and the potential severity of the existence of bone fragments impronting the bladder disruption.
We describe a case of a 60-year-old male suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A routine-performed CT showed multiple lymphadenopathies and an hypodense area in the left prostatic lobe. The patient was sent to our department to carry out a transrectal ultrasound and prostatic biopsy. He didn't relate any urinary symptoms.
Prospective clinical trial in ASA 1-2 patients undergoing gynecologic surgery. The patients were randomized to 2 groups: the remifentanil group received a perfusion of 1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) until intubation whereas the fentanyl group received a bolus dose of 2 microg x kg(-1). Etomidate (0.3 mg x kg(-1)) and rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg x kg(-1)) were used for anesthetic induction. Seven serial measurements of systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were recorded in addition to heart rate and peripheral blood oxyhemoglobin saturation at the following times: baseline, denitrogenation, postinduction, and 3 more times at consecutive 2-minute intervals.
Observational study of 70 patients treated with spinal cord stimulation in the following postures and situations: decubitus position, standing, seated, and walking. With the patients standing, we analyzed the thresholds of perception, pain, and pain relief, as well as the therapeutic range. Studies were performed in all patients. Later, data were analyzed by anatomical positioning of the stimulator (cervical, thoracic, sacral, occipital, or subcutaneous).
A national e-mail survey was implemented, contacting 300 randomly selected HSTs in general surgery. A questionnaire was used to ascertain their current practice and the presence or absence of formal diathermy training.
This prospective study was conducted in the surgical departments of three tertiary care hospitals of the Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, Pakistan, from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2007. Detailed history and examination of all patients were carried out to reach the diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene. After initial resuscitation, patients were treated aggressively, including surgical debridement.
Eighteen patients referred to our imaging department with a provisional diagnosis on ultrasound of renal tract duplication during a three year period were identified by searching the radiological computer files. The presenting features were urinary infection (13), abdominal pain (3) and abnormal antenatal sonography (2).
Prospectively entered data were reviewed for all patients (n=100) that underwent breast conserving surgery for DCIS by the senior author over a ten year period. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated for the total sample and for a series of univariate analyses.
Multielectrode recording have been done in every kid before and after hemodialysis. For every record it was created isopotential map. By the comparing our maps with model maps for healthy children it was affirmed that in greater part of studied examples of hemodialysed children there are present early changes indicating conducting disturbances in left bundle of fasciculus atrioventricularis (His) and initial stage of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). That changes haven't been confirmed in classic ECG, which suggests that the disturbances in excitation conductance observed on isointegral maps are far beyond the area detected by 12-electrode classic ECG recording.
48 children (27 males and 21 females) with IgAN (n=21) and SHN (n=27) aged from 4.5 to 19 mean 13.3 years were enrolled into the study. In all patients ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed. In detail pulse pressure during 24 hours, activity and rest period (PP/24 h, PP/a, PP/r) as index PP (PPI) and circadian blood pressure profile were analyzed. In all patients BMI Z-score, hypertensive medications, GFR according to Schwartz formula and serum uric acid level were evaluated.
OPN, PDGF-BB and BMP-7 plasma concentrations were assessed by ELISA, in 16 children on PD, in 13 on HD and in 12 controls with normal kidney function.
11 children and young adults on chronic HD were enrolled in the study, 15 age-matched subjects with normal kidney function served as controls. The serum concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were assessed by ELISA.
The study group included 77 nephrotic children (aged 2-18 years) divided into four groups, i.e. in acute phase of the disease (24), during steroid-induced (24), steroid-free (12) and in long-term remission (17). Twenty five healthy children served as controls. GSH and HCY in plasma were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fraction of protein-bound and free aminothiols was assessed and albumin saturation was calculated.
39 children with INS aged 2.5-17 year (mean 9.35 +/- 5.6), 15 children in relapse, 24 in remission and 8 healthy were included into the study. Serum total protein, albumin, cholesterol, daily proteinuria and BMI were measured in children with INS. Serum resistin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA.
Retrospectively, causes of ESRD, frequency, duration of the disease until diagnosis of ESRD in 195 children treated in 1973-2008 were analysed.
Presented work is based on questionnaire research, carried out from December 2006 to March 2007. It has included 82 nurses, who working in dialyses stations in Lodz province.
The study group consisted of 150 adult dialysis patients treated with hemodialysis in dialysis units in Lodz region. The participants were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire specially tailored for the study.
Examinations were conducted on 71 children, 3-15 years old: (A)--44 children with NS (proteinuria above 50 mg/kg b.v./24 hours); (B)--27 children without proteinuria (remission NS). Control group (K)--30 healthy children. Concentration of LN and FN were determined by EIA.
The study group was 7 patients (hemodialysed--2 boys, mean age 7, 7+/-0.1; peritoneal dialysis--5: 3 boys and 2 girls, mean age 5, 6+/-5.0). Sevelamer (Renagel, 800 mg, Genzyme) was used in all patients in mean dosis of 117 mg/kgm.c./d due to lack of effect of the typical treatment (vitamin D, diet, calcium carbonate). Results of treatment by sevelamer were estimated by measuring of calcium, phosphates, albumins, parathormone and alkalic phosphate concentration in the serum and blood gases after 6 and 12 month.
105 neonates and infants with hydronephrosis were assessed between Jan and Dec 2007 (27 girls and 78 boys). All patients had postnatal ultrasound performed. Static and dynamic scyntigraphy and cystography were performed according to set indications. Therapeutic decisions were made following a team meeting between pediatric nephrologists and urologists.
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) with microscopic hematuria was recognized in a boy in the age of 9.7 years. In kidney biopsy focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis was found. Remission was obtained on oral prednisone (60 mg/24 hrs). Second relapse of NS was treated with methylprednisolone pulse (VI pulses--600 mg/pulse) with a good effect. Third relapse of NS (secondary steroidoresistency) was treated with oral cyclophosphamide in a total dose 140 mg/kg/therapy--the treatment was complicated by a massive oral cavity mycosis and sinusitis. 3 weeks after starting cyclosporine A (CsA) proteinuria subsided. During CsA treatment severe headaches and pains in orbits with nausea appeared. In neurological examinations no abnormalities were found, in ophthalmological examination--slight opacification of the lens was found. EEG revealed lesions localised in a posterior cerebral parts, and CT of the head showed slight dilatation of ventricles. In MRI foci of signal intensification were found in subcortical white substance. CsA was stopped after 4 months of the treatment and prednisone was stopped a month later. Control MRI after 6 months revealed maintenance of the foci in white substance. The patient is under nephrological care, has no proteinuria and no neurological symptoms.
The methods of descriptive epidemiology were used. We included all County population with the diagnosis of fatal injuries (S00-T98, ICD-10) recorded during the study period. Mortality data were collected from the Central Bureau of Statistics. The distribution of mortality indicators according to the cause of death, age and sex is presented as absolute numbers, percentage and specific rates per 100,000 population.
This cross-sectional study was carried out in 77 DMT2 patients in two family medicine practices. Patients filled out two questionnaires: on patient general data and ZLK-90-2 questionnaire. Statistic analysis was done using Statistica, version 7.1 software, and values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
This prospective study was conducted in the course of one month at six GP practices (three urban and one rural practice in inland area, and one urban and one rural practice in coastal area of Croatia). Patient sociodemographic data (age and sex), referral request (by patient, GP, GP and specialist in agreement, specialist only) and kind of visit (first, follow-up) were collected. The contribution of referrals was assessed by GPs using modified Likert's scale (1-markedly significant, 2-significant, 3-undetermined, 4-small and 5-insignificant). On comparison of frequencies chi square test was used. Statistical analyses were done by use of licensed software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).
In this retrospective study we reviewed records on 30 patients that had undergone VCE at Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia, between October 2006 and February 2008. The indications for VCE were restricted to the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) (n = 10), iron deficiency anemia (n = 2), suspected Crohn's disease (n = 1), assessment of known small bowel Crohn's disease (n = 5), unexplained diarrhea (n = 6), chronic abdominal pain (n = 3), suspected ganglioneurinoma (n = 1) and suspected polyposis syndrome (n = 2). To be eligible for VCE, patients had to have previously undergone usual diagnostic methods of upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel follow-through, without discovering the cause of their symptoms. Before swallowing the capsule, patients were instructed not to eat anything the day before VCE and to drink 4 L of liquids, and additional 2 L magnesium sulfate. In all patients we used Olympus EndoCapsule Software (Tokyo, Japan). Results were interpreted by one specialist, gastroenterologist.
The number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 Zagreb inhabitants per day (DDD/1000/day) were calculated on the basis of data on the number of packages of each individual hypolipemic (C10) for each study year. Data on the rate of hospitalization for the leading cardiovascular complications were collected as indirect indicators of the statin prescribing quality.
One hundred consecutive coronary computed tomography angiography examinations of female patients were retrospectively evaluated to define the angle between the long axis of the left heart and the axial imaging plane. The scan length required to image the entire left ventricle along with the coronary arteries was measured for an axial scan plane as well as for a scan plane parallel to the long axis of the left heart. The overlap between these imaging volumes and the lower portion of the breast was measured.
A prototype DEI system was constructed using a 1-kW tungsten x-ray tube and a single silicon monochromator and analyzer crystal. The monochromator crystal was aligned to reflect the combined Kalpha1 (59.32 keV) and Kalpha2 (57.98 keV) characteristic emission lines of tungsten using a tube voltage of 160 kV. System performance and demonstration of contrast were evaluated using a nylon monofilament refraction phantom, full-thickness breast specimens, a human thumb, and a live mouse.
Images from 128 women who had oophorectomies during a 16-month period with CT and/or MR studies within 5 years of surgery (145 CT scans from 103 women and 49 MR studies from 42 women, with 17 having both MR and CT studies) were reviewed by three radiologists who assigned QA scores of 0 (no QA issue), 1 (minor issue with minimal impact on clinical care), or 2 (major issue with potential impact on clinical care). The difficulty of diagnosis was assigned a score of 0 (very difficult diagnosis to make), 1 (difficult but possible to make the diagnosis), or 2 (diagnosis should be made). The incidence of adnexal QA issues was calculated using total CT and MR pelvic examinations performed on women during the interval.
Imaging findings of 10 fat-containing HCCs on CT (n = 2) or MRI (n = 3) or on both CT and MRI (n = 5) were retrospectively reviewed in 9 patients. Both techniques included serial contrast enhanced imaging in arterial, portal venous, and late venous phases.
Non-gated axial computed tomography (CT) of the chest has traditionally been used to evaluate normal great vessel anatomy for prognosis and management. However, non-gated axial chest CT cannot account for the obliquity, systolic expansion, and non-axial motion of the great vessels during the cardiac cycle and may misclassify patients as normal or abnormal for prognostic and management purposes. To date, normative reference values for double-oblique, short-axis great vessel diameters have not been established using current generation electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated 64-detector row MDCT. A total of 103 (43% women, age 51 +/- 14 years) consecutive normotensive, non-obese adults free of cardiopulmonary or great vessel structural disease, arrhythmias, or significant coronary artery disease were studied by MDCT. Individuals underwent examination for determination of end-diastolic (ED) pulmonary artery (PA) and superior vena cava (SVC) dimensions in double-oblique short axes for comparison with the ascending aorta and the right-sided cardiac chambers.
Computed tomographic examinations were performed on 48 patients with existing or suspicious pulmonary nodules on chest radiography. Three radiologists independently reported the location and pattern (GGO, solid, or part solid) of each nodule candidate on computed tomographic scans, assigned each a confidence score, and then analyzed all scans using the CAD system. A reference standard was established by a consensus panel of different radiologists, who found 229 noncalcified nodules with diameters &gt; or = 4 mm. True-positive and false-positive results and confidence levels were used to generate jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic plots.
Cross-sectional imaging of a multimodality vascular phantom was performed using intravascular and surface MRI, multidetector computed tomography, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Using a balanced steady-state free-precession sequence, 18 sequences parameters sets were investigated (12 for intravascular MRI and 6 for surface MRI). Vessel diameters for all images and modalities were computed using an automated vessel segmentation algorithm.
Testing this hypothesis required an ability to measure eyestrain. This capability was developed by measuring the visual accommodation of radiologists before and after diagnostic viewing work using an autorefractor that was capable of making multiple measurements of accommodation per second. Three radiologists and three residents focused on a simple target placed at near to far distances while accommodation was measured. The target distances varied from 20 to 183 cm from the eye. The data were collected prior to and after a day of digital diagnostic viewing.
A chest phantom containing 13 artificial GGO nodules with known volumes was scanned using a 64-slice computed tomographic scanner at different tube currents (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 mA). Volumetric measurements were performed using software. The relative percentage error and the absolute percentage error between the volume measures on computed tomography and the reference-standard volumes were calculated. Correlations between the mean absolute percentage error and the mean attenuation of nodules and between the ratio of solid component and the mean attenuation of nodules were analyzed.
An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned with a 64-section CT scanner using following tube voltages: 140 kVp (Protocol A), 120 kVp (Protocol B), 100 kVp (Protocol C), and 80 kVp (Protocol D). To achieve similar noise, combined z-axis and xy-axes automatic tube current modulation was applied. Effective dose (ED) for the four tube voltages was assessed. Three plastic vials filled with different concentrations of iodinated solution were placed on the phantom's abdomen to obtain attenuation measurements. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated and a figure of merit (FOM) for each iodinated solution was computed as SNR(2)/ED.
Four components (free water [FW], olive oil [OL], 2% and 4% agar gels [2A and 4A, respectively]) were arranged in a phantom set. Seven MR images were obtained with different echo time and repetition time. ICA was performed on 23 combinations of four components. A segregation rate higher than 70% was defined as effective.
CEUS was performed in 12 female rabbits with breast VX2 tumor after subcutaneous administration of SonoVue. The site, number, and pattern of enhancement of the SLNs were observed and recorded. After CEUS, 0.5 mL of blue dye was injected into the same location as SonoVue and the SLNs were detected by surgical dissection. The findings of CEUS were compared with those of blue dye.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and localized ROC (LROC) analysis of clinical images was performed using the standard digital image database of the Japanese Radiation Technology Society. A total of 30 images with and 20 images without nodule samples were extracted randomly from the database and used for ROC analysis. A total of 100 images were prepared for observation of reduced and nonreduced images. Observers' viewing images were adjusted as nonreduced size (large, 30 x 30 cm) and reduced size (small, 15 x 15 cm).
A survey was sent to all members of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments. Respondents were asked to indicate the number of trainees in their program and whether they participated in internal or external moonlighting. If internal moonlighting occurred, the chair was asked in which postgraduate year residents were permitted to moonlight internally. If external moonlighting was permitted, the respondents were asked which postgraduate year trainees were permitted to moonlight outside of their institution.
Cadaveric human tali (normal and degenerated) and a knee and thumb were imaged with DEI using a conventional x-ray tube and DEI setup that included a double-silicon crystal monochromator and a silicon crystal analyzer positioned between the imaged object and the detector.
Twenty-five published articles (1987-2002) were reviewed to identify potential ADCPQ domains. Three caregiver focus groups (n=24) were conducted to develop a first draft of the questionnaire. After evaluating the acceptance of ADCPQ to caregivers through in-depth interviews (n=10), its psychometric properties were assessed using data from 986 patients enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, four-arm, placebo- and active-controlled, 24-week trial.
Double-masked, randomized, 3-month clinical trial of 37 patients with rosacea-associated eyelid and corneal changes (defined as lid margin telangiectasia, meibomian gland inspissation, and/or fullness of the lid margin). All findings were standardized and compared to photographs for grading.
Ten formalin-fixed cadavers were dissected to examine the appearance and structure of the puborectalis and its relationship with the peripheral organs. The puborectalis was also observed in a fresh male cadaver using transrectal ultrasound. In the fresh male cadaver, the puborectalis was located using transrectal sonography, the muscle was confirmed by anatomy, and the thickness was measured.
In this single-center, investigator-masked trial, patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomized to receive either ketorolac 0.4% q.i.d. or bromfenac 0.09% b.i.d. for 2 days preoperatively. Aqueous humor was collected at the start of surgery 6 hours after the last dose of ketorolac 0.4% and 12 hours after the last dose of bromfenac 0.09%. Aqueous PGE(2) levels and drug concentrations were evaluated by a competitive enzyme immunoassay and reverse-phase HPLC-mass spectroscopy, respectively.
Twenty-one Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. Subjects had been treated with voglibose for at least 3 months. They underwent a 400 kcal balanced food meal tolerance test before and 8 weeks after the changeover from voglibose to acarbose. Subjects were divided into two groups: the first group (low-dose group; n=11) was changed over from 0.6 mg/day voglibose to 150 mg/day acarbose, and the other (high-dose group; n=10) from 0.9 mg/day voglibose to 300 mg/day acarbose.
We searched the PubMed database combining HIV/AIDS with different keywords for psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms (e.g. depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis, dementia, substance abuse) and for psychopharmacological treatment. The years covered by these searches included 1980 to 2008.
Patients with an onset of schizophrenia at 12 years or younger, were included. From the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS), patients' information and summary report data was tabulated and analyzed. Specific subgroups were further compared. This sub-population of 12 subjects was further compared with a group of the adult sample.
500 Yorubas in Lagos were randomly sampled (with a questionnaire), and 100 'home video' films were analyzed. Data were analyzed for: elements of world view; elements that pertain to illness in general; elements that pertain to psychotic illness; how such illness is to be treated.
A preliminary overview of health literature was done on formal mental health care and traditional alternatives in South Africa since the 1950's. Important themes were identified as first step in a qualitative approach to identify concepts.

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for visual impairment.
The USPSTF reviewed evidence published since its last review on screening adults 65 years or older in the primary care setting for visual acuity impairment associated with uncorrected refractive errors, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration.
MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies published in English from 1996 to July 2008.
Randomized trials and controlled observational studies that directly evaluated screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults were selected. To evaluate indirect evidence on screening, investigators included studies of diagnostic test accuracy and systematic reviews, randomized trials, and controlled observational studies of treatments for uncorrected refractive errors, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Details were abstracted about the patient sample, study design, data analysis, follow-up, and results. Quality was assessed by using predefined criteria.
Forty-five adults were randomly assigned to an Internet intervention (n = 22) or wait-list control group (n = 23). Forty-four eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 44.86 [11.03] years; 34 women) who had a history of sleep difficulties longer than 10 years on average (mean [SD], 10.59 [8.89] years) were included in the analyses.
The Internet intervention is based on well-established face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy incorporating the primary components of sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention.
The Insomnia Severity Index and daily sleep diary data were used to determine changes in insomnia severity and the main sleep variables, including wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency.
Multivariate neuroanatomical pattern classification was performed on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of individuals in early or late ARMS vs healthy controls (HCs). The predictive power of the method was then evaluated by categorizing the baseline imaging data of individuals with transition to psychosis vs those without transition vs HCs after 4 years of clinical follow-up. Classification generalizability was estimated by cross-validation and by categorizing an independent cohort of 45 new HCs.
Departments of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.

For each disorder, family history scores were calculated as the proportion of affected family members from data on 3 generations of the participants' families. Data collected prospectively at the study's repeated assessments (ages 11-32 years) were used to assess recurrence, impairment, and age at onset; data collected by means of a life history calendar at age 32 years were used to assess service use.
MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases.
All family studies published from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2006, reporting morbid risk or raw counts of schizophrenia or BD in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of a proband group with DSM-III or later; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision; or research diagnostic criteria schizophrenia or BD were included. Of the original 2326 studies identified through the database search, 38 studies were used to investigate rates of BD in FDRs of probands with schizophrenia, while 39 studies were used to examine rates of schizophrenia in FDRs of BD probands.
Data were analyzed with a novel random-effects bootstrapping technique that allows for the inclusion of studies lacking a patient or control group, which made up a substantial portion of the available data. Data were also blindly weighted for methodological quality.
Twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Outcomes were examined using analysis of variance modeling analyses and linear regression in an intention-to-treat population.
Eleven waves of data from the prospective population-based Great Smoky Mountains Study (N = 1420) were used.
The Great Smoky Mountains Study is a longitudinal study of the development of psychiatric disorder and need for mental health services in rural and urban youth. A representative sample of children was recruited from 11 counties in western North Carolina.
Children in the community aged 9 to 16, 19, and 21 years.
Common psychiatric disorders were assessed in childhood (ages 9-12 years) and adolescence (ages 13-16 years) with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment and in young adulthood (ages 19 and 21 years) with the Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment.
The GWAS tested 524,396 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). All SNPs with P &lt; 10(-4) were subjected to the follow-up study. In addition, nominally significant SNPs from genes that had also shown expression changes in rat brains after long-term alcohol consumption were selected for the follow-up step.
Five university hospitals in southern and central Germany.
The GWAS included 487 male inpatients with alcohol dependence as defined by the DSM-IV and an age at onset younger than 28 years and 1358 population-based control individuals.

We used a case-control study to evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NFKBIA and NFKBIB (the genes encoding IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, respectively) and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. We queried 19 tagSNPs and putative-functional SNPs among 930 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,037 controls from two studies.
To fill the gap in our knowledge about MMP expression in breast cancer, we analyzed the expression of all known human MMPs in a panel of twenty-five tissue samples (five normal breast tissues, ten grade 2 (G2) and ten grade 3 (G3) breast cancer tissues). As we found different expression levels for several MMPs in normal breast and breast cancer tissue as well as depending on tumor grade, we additionally analyzed the expression of MMPs in four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, BT 20, ZR 75/1) commonly used in research. The results could thus be used as model for further studies on human breast cancer. Expression analysis was performed on mRNA and protein level using semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry.
We identified 1,048 Taiwanese breast carcinoma patients, of whom 167 (15.9%) had TNBC. Data used for analysis were derived from our cancer registry database for women with breast cancer who were diagnosed between 2002 January and 2006 December.
The study was a cross sectional in design that involved 265 hypertensive patients receiving treatment at the medical outpatient unit of the Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta, Nigeria. They were all consecutive patients that presented at the hospital during the period of the study who meet the inclusion criteria and consented to participate in the study. Demographic data, disease characteristics such as symptoms and signs and recent drug history were obtained from the patients and their hospital records as documented by the physician. The SF-36 questionnaire was administered once by interview to the participants to measure their HRQOL. Descriptive statistics was used in summarizing the demographic data and hypertension related histories of the participants. Multiple linear regression was used to model for the influence of socio demographic and clinical variables of the hypertensives on their HRQOL.
Human atherosclerotic carotid plaques (n = 29, 12 associated with symptoms) were removed by endarterectomy. Calpain activity and apoptosis were detected by performing immunohistochemical analysis and TUNEL assay on human carotid plaque sections. An antibody specific for calpain-proteolyzed alpha-fodrin was used on western blots.

The study, encompassing multiple sites, is based on a sample of 398 GPs, representative of the GP population in the Canadian province of Quebec. GPs were asked to answer a 143-item questionnaire on their socio-demographic and clinical practice profiles, patient characteristics, perceived inter-professional relationships and quality of care. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
The survey was carried out using a self-administered standardised anonymous questionnaire given to all of the Vaccination Service employees in the Apulia Region.
The model consists of multiple compartments representing logical movement of a respiratory symptomatic (tuberculosis suspect) through the health system, including patient- and health system delays. Main outputs of the model are tuberculosis death rate and treatment outcome (i.e. full or partial cure). We quantified the model parameters for the Jogjakarta province context, using a two round Delphi survey with five Indonesian tuberculosis experts.
Differences in mean body mass index (BMI) and other anthropometric measures including weight, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio were assessed by a general linear model in individuals categorized by INSIG2 rs7566605 genotype. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the risk of obesity (BMI &gt;or= 30 kg/m2).
To investigate the biological basis for these observations, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using microarray data from 246 ER+ BC samples from women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. To create an in vitro model of growth factor (GF) signaling activation, MCF-7 cells were treated with heregulin (HRG), an HER3 ligand.
We cross-sectionally sampled individuals assisted by the public primary health care system (n = 768, 35-60 years old). Participants were interviewed by phone and screened about pain. They were then invited to be clinically assessed (304 accepted). Pain was estimated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Fibromyalgia was assessed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), as well as screening for tender points using dolorimetry. Statistical analyses included Bayesian Statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis Anova test (significance level = 5%).
New items generated from qualitative interviews were combined with items from the RA-WIS to form a draft AS-WIS. Rasch analysis was used to examine the scaling properties of the AS-WIS using data generated through a postal survey. The scale was validated against a gold standard of expert assessment, a test-retest survey examined reliability.
We evaluated the following systems: Amended Aberdeen, Extended Wigglesworth; PSANZ-PDC, ReCoDe, Tulip and CODAC. Nine teams from 7 countries applied the classification systems to cohorts of stillbirths from their regions using 857 stillbirth cases. The main outcome measures were: the ability to retain the important information about the death using the InfoKeep rating; the ease of use according to the Ease rating (both measures used a five-point scale with a score &lt;2 considered unsatisfactory); inter-observer agreement and the proportion of unexplained stillbirths. A randomly selected subset of 100 stillbirths was used to assess inter-observer agreement.
The method uses a visual representation of the symptoms and diseases coded during a patient consultation according to the International Classification of Primary Care 2nd version (ICPC-2). The surveillance data are transformed into color-coded cells, ranging from white to red, reflecting the increasing frequency of observed signs. They are placed in a graphic reference frame mimicking body anatomy. Simple visual observation of color-change patterns over time, concerning a single code or a combination of codes, enables detection in the setting of interest.
We conducted a case-study based content analysis of legislative materials used in the development of six state workplace smoking laws, including written and spoken testimony and the text of proposed and passed bills and amendments. We coded testimony given before legislators for arguments used, and identified the institutional affiliations of presenters and their position on the legislation. We compared patterns in the arguments made in testimony to the relative strength of each state's final legislation.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 junior high schools from April to June of 2008. A total of 2821 adolescents aged 14.06 +/- 0.93 years (8.9% of migrant workers vs. 91.1% of general residents) participated in the survey. A self-administrated questionnaire was used to collect information on knowledge, attitude, and behaviors associated with increased risk for HIV/STI.
Lung tidal volume, dynamic elastance, resistance, and pleural pressure were measured in a resistance and compliance system on mechanically-ventilated anesthestized young (14-28 day old) and adult (6-12 week old) cotton rats. Animals at the same age were infected with influenza virus, and breathing rates and other respiratory measurements were recorded using a whole body flow plethysmograph.
Observational data collection and follow-up of a cohort of older people undergoing brain magnetic resonance imaging after non-disabling complaints.
11 European centres.
639 non-disabled older patients (mean age 74.1 (SD 5.0), 45.1% men) in whom brain magnetic resonance imaging showed mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter (Fazekas scale). Magnetic resonance imaging assessment also included cerebral infarcts and atrophy.
Transition from no disability (defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the instrumental activities of daily living scale) to disability (score &gt;/=2) or death over three year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were incident dementia and stroke.
Arterial pressure measurement and pulse wave velocity (PWV) recordings were performed in 12 student military divers before and after 15 weeks' training. The results were compared with the same investigations performed in 12 non-diver healthy subjects.
11 patients with McArdle disease (3 male, 8 female; age: 35.5 (SD 13.9) years, height: 166 (8) cm, body mass: 75.2 (13.1) kg) were recruited for the study. The patients walked initially at 0.42 m/s, increasing by 0.14 m/s per 3 min stage. Exercise was terminated when participants completed 3 minutes at 1.80 m/s or when a Borg CR10 pain scale rating of "4" was reached. Stages were separated by 60 s for capillary blood sampling for analysis of hGH and blood lactate concentration.
Participants (n = 12) were tested in three climbing conditions that were designed to invoke low, moderate and high physical and mental stress. Plasma cortisol concentrations were collected before and after climbing and participants reported subjective anxiety and self-confidence states for each climb.
Retrospective survey and prospective study.
During the preparation camps for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, all 123 referees pre-selected for the tournament completed a questionnaire on injuries and musculoskeletal complaints. During the tournament, the characteristics and consequences of all injuries and complaints incurred by the 63 officiating referees were documented.
Randomised cross-over study.
Biomechanical movement laboratory.
20 healthy subjects were included. One subject was excluded during data collection.
The subjects performed forward lunges before, during and 20 minutes after induction of experimental quadriceps muscle pain. Muscle pain was induced using hypertonic saline (5.8%) injected intramuscularly. Isotonic saline (0.9%) was used as control.
Three-dimensional movement analyses were performed and inverse dynamics were used to calculate joint kinematics and kinetics for ankle, knee and hip joints. Electromyographic (EMG) signals of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles were recorded.

114 subjects with symptoms of Achilles tendon pathology and 98 healthy controls were genotyped for MMP3 variants rs679620, rs591058 and rs650108.
Injury surveillance data, gathered over a 2 year period in professional football, cricket and rugby union to produce 335 diagnoses, were coded with both OSICS-8 and OSICS-10. Code-diagnosis agreement was assessed for OSICS-8 in terms of whether a diagnosis was codeable or noncodeable, and for OSICS-10 by evaluating the highest available OSICS-10 tier of coding. Eight clinicians coded a list of 20 diagnoses, comprising a range of pathologies to all gross anatomical regions, which were compared to assess inter-rater reliability.
Quasi-experimental, pretest-post-test, nonequivalent groups design.
Before the exercise protocol, 45 female and 30 male young amateur athletes completed computerized cognitive testing, symptom ratings and balance testing. The 15-minute cycle ergometry protocol, conducted at 90 revolutions/minute, was as follows: 0-2 minutes at 0 W tension, 2-5 minutes at 50 W, 5-8 minutes at 100 W, 8-11 minutes at 150 W and 11-14 minutes at 200 W tension followed by a 1-minute cooling-down period. After exercise, participants completed symptom ratings, balance testing and perceived exertion ratings. Self-reported symptoms were assessed using an abbreviated version of the Post-Concussion Scale.
Team physicians prospectively recorded individual player exposure and time loss injuries during 12 European Championships (men's EURO n = 1, men's Under-21 n = 2, men's Under-19 n = 3, men's Under-17 n = 3, women's Under-19 n = 3) from 2006 to 2008.

Children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were asked to wear a uniaxial accelerometer for 7 days. Measures of counts per minute (cpm), minutes spent in moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) and minutes of sedentary behaviour (msed) were derived from the accelerometer worn at age 12. Children were also examined, at age 10, using an autorefractor to estimate myopia. Social and parental factors were collected from pregnancy and physical measures of the child were recorded at age 12.
We obtained biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis muscle of 83 patients. Of the 44 patients with clinically diagnosed statin-associated myopathy, 29 were currently taking a statin, and 15 had discontinued statin therapy before the biopsy (minimal duration of discontinuation 3 weeks). We also included 19 patients who were taking statins and had no myopathy, and 20 patients who had never taken statins and had no myopathy. We classified the muscles as injured if 2% or more of the muscle fibres in a biopsy sample showed damage. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated the expression levels of candidate genes potentially related to myocyte injury.
For these analyses, we used volume and expenditure data related to prescriptions for cardiovascular medications obtained from IMS Health Canada's CompuScript Audit database for the period 1996-2006. Here, we describe national and provincial patterns of utilization and expenditures for specified classes of cardiovascular medications.
In this pragmatic randomized trial, we randomly assigned adult primary care patients with type 2 diabetes to receive the intervention or usual care. The intervention involved shared access by the primary care provider and the patient to a Web-based, colour-coded diabetes tracker, which provided sequential monitoring values for 13 diabetes risk factors, their respective targets and brief, prioritized messages of advice. The primary outcome measure was a process composite score. Secondary outcomes included clinical composite scores, quality of life, continuity of care and usability. The outcome assessors were blinded to each patient's intervention status.
A total of 101 subjects were included in this study. Serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, C reactive protein, leptin, TGF-alpha, adiponectin and insulin were measured by ELISA. Data were logarithmically transformed for variables not normally distributed. Analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni was applied to compare the data between the groups. Simple and partial correlation coefficients between the variables were determined and a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationships between the variables of interest.
We describe a case of HCM with midventricular obstruction and apical aneurysm formation in 3 patients coming from a single family. This HCM pattern was detected by 2D-echocardiography and confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in one of the patients because of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia detected in 24-h Holter monitoring and an abrupt drop in systolic blood pressure during maximal exercise test. The defibrillator activated 8 months after implantation by suppression of a ventricular tachycardia providing anti-tachycardia pacing. The patient died due to refractory heart failure 2 years after initial evaluation. The rest of the patients are stable after a 2.5-y follow-up period.
Consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography during the previous 6 mo were recruited. Patients with major depression, bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, or malignancy were excluded. Patients underwent dolorimetry for tender-point assessment and completed the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ). Group A included patients with significant coronary pathology (n = 43), group B included patients with normal coronary arteries (n = 50), and group C included patients with normal controls (n = 51). A cardiological score incorporated the number of coronary arteries with significant pathology and left ventricular function. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data and a one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables; a multivariate linear regression was performed to compare groups.
In this prospective observational study, angiographic and clinical 6-mo results of a carbon-coated stent for treatment of acute lesions in native coronary arteries were evaluated. Angiographic main outcome measures included in-stent late loss and binary restenosis rate. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were defined as any death, Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization.
In 2004-2005 during standard follow-up at 6 mo after acute MI in 158 subjects, BNP was measured using an immunoenzymatic method. Of them, 126 patients had IVCD: 31, left bundle branch block (LBBB); 36, right bundle branch block (RBBB); 30, left anterior hemiblock (LAH); and 29, left posterior hemiblock (LPH). Thirty two patients with a previous MI, but without IVCD, served as controls, whereas 15 healthy subjects entered the comparative group.
The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database of New York State was used to retrieve cases of aortic dissection in persons &lt; or = 21 years old over a 10-year period. A retrospective analysis for risk or associated conditions was undertaken.
We performed a single institution retrospective review of medical records and analyses of echocardiographic findings in patients &lt; or = 45 years of age hospitalized between 2001 and 2004 who were discharged with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or heart failure. After exclusion of patients with coronary artery disease or severe cardiac valvular disease, the remaining patients were divided into 2 groups based on their abuse or non abuse of methamphetamine, as determined by the documented history in the medical records or urine toxicology testing.
From January 2004 to November 2006, 12 of 100 patients admitted with a diagnosis of PTE had an MRCT. Diagnosis of in-transit right-sided thrombi was made when a wormlike elongated mass was detected. The primary end point was comparison of the mortality rate of MRCT (+) patients with that of MRCT (-) patients for an average of 8 months of follow-up. The secondary end points were comparison of clinical and laboratory data between these 2 groups.
Seventeen patients with severe heart failure (ejection fraction 20%) were exposed to 3 types of load for a period of 10 seconds: 1) MVC-LEM with persistent physiologic breathing, 2) the Valsalva maneuver, and 3) a combination of MVC-LEM with the Valsalva maneuver. During each measurement, a continuous, time-synchronized record was taken of the electrocardiogram, and the pulmonary and systemic blood pressures.
Using one of the largest single-institutional cohorts, this study evaluated all patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from 2002 through 2005. Analysis was restricted to patients receiving a single stent or undergoing balloon-only angioplasty in a single anatomic site. Small-vessel stents (SVS) were defined as 2.00 to 2.75 mm and large-vessel stents (LVS) as 3.00 to 4.00 mm in diameter.
The study included 80 consecutive patients with myocardial infarction (MI) treated in the Cardiology Ward of the Specialist Hospital in Radom, Poland, in 2005. Analyses were performed retrospectively. The patients were separated into 2 groups according to age. The group I study group consisted of 40 patients aged 75 or over (aged 75-95; mean 81 years) and the group II control group consisted of 40 patients aged below 75 years (aged 42-67; mean 60 years).
A total of 4778 CHD outpatients were enrolled from 52 centers in 6 Chinese cities from January 2006 to January 2007.
A total of 84 patients (51 males) who had undergone SES implantation for the treatment of native LMCA stenosis were enrolled. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on angiographic lesion location: those with significant stenosis in the ostium and/or body (group 1; n = 39) and those involving bifurcation (group 2; n = 45).
In a single center, prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 193 patients undergoing elective PCI (with or without stenting) for chronic stable angina and/or an abnormal stress test were randomized to receive 200 mcg of intracoronary nicardipine (n = 93) or saline solution (n = 100) prior to intervention. Cardiac enzyme levels were measured immediately and at 8 and 16 hours after the procedure. Major adverse clinical events (MACE) were assessed at 30 days and at 6 months.
Patients with STEMI within 12 hours after symptom onset were randomized to a facilitated PCI group (n = 19) or to a primary PCI group (n = 20). The primary endpoint was myocardial infarct size evaluated by the volume of delayed hyperenhancement on CE-MRI at 1 month after index procedure.
We performed an analysis in 865 indigent HF patients enrolled in a HF disease management program at the Chabert Medical Center in Louisiana. All subjects were classified as having MetS if they met three or more of the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. Mortality was defined using the Social Security Death Index. We calculated the relative hazard (RH) of death for those patients with and without MetS.
Using a case-control study design, 57 patients with hypertensive AF (persistent AF: 32, paroxysmal AF: 25) were included into the study groups. A total of 32 age-matched patients with hypertension, but without AF were selected as the control group. The expressions of PPARgamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA in monocytes were detected by using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was measured by immunoenzymetric methods.
Using data collected in the multicenter Baxter POET database between 1996 and 2005, the study population included incident Canadian PD patients. Potential predictors of peritonitis were sought using a negative binomial model and an Andersen-Gill model. Study variables included age, gender, race, cause of renal disease, diabetes status, transfer from hemodialysis (HD), previous renal transplant, and continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) versus automated PD (APD).
Hb variability was determined using 6 mo of "baseline" data between January 1, 2003, and October 31, 2005. A variety of definitions for Hb variability were examined to ensure consistency and robustness.
Ninety-eight patients who donated a kidney 5 to 40 years previously were stratified according to body mass index (BMI) at donation and evaluated for renal dysfunction and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients who were from the 2005 through 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database; did not have renal disease; and were matched for age, gender, race, and BMI served as two-kidney control subjects.
A retrospective study was conducted in a referral center for patients with ADPKD in Paris, France. We identified using a computerized database all patients who had ADPKD and were admitted in the nephrology department of H√¥pital Necker between January 1998 and August 2008 with likely or definite renal and/or hepatic cyst infection. Medical files of all included patients were reviewed.
This was a retrospective chart review of 44 patients with CKD stages 2 to 4, who were managed in the general nephrology clinic (1996-2001, n = 20) or the CRI clinic (2002-2007, n = 24) for 1 yr before starting renal replacement therapy (RRT). Laboratory parameters, growth, and dialysis access type at time of RRT were compared between the two cohorts.
Patients who initiated peritoneal dialysis at our center since January 1998 and had a baseline peritoneal equilibration test, measurement of dialysis adequacy, and 24-h dialysate Pcl were included. Demography, comorbidities, and biochemical data were prospectively collected. Follow-up was until death or the end of the period studied. Multivariate regression analysis identified factors that were associated with Pcl. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors that were associated with survival.
This prospective crossover study compared single-dose daptomycin (6 mg/kg, 30-min intravenous infusion) pharmacokinetics administered after HD versus during the last part of HD with high-permeability (HP) and low-permeability (LP) dialyzers to seven patients who had ESRD and were on thrice-weekly HD. Serial blood samples were collected to determine daptomycin serum concentrations and protein binding. Statistical analysis was done using linear mixed model analysis.
We conducted a retrospective analysis from the national Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database that included 54,669 candidates who were older than 60 yr and listed in the United States for a solitary kidney transplant from 1995 through 2007. Using survival models, we estimated time to DDTx and mortality after candidate listing with and without patients initially listed as temporarily inactive (status 7).
The patient cohort, which started PD from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, was identified from the Scottish Renal Registry (n = 1238). Possible EPS cases were identified by the ten adult Scottish renal units. Patient records were examined to ensure cases met diagnostic criteria.
ALERT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of fluvastatin on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in 2102 renal transplant recipients. Patients initially randomized to fluvastatin or placebo in the 5- to 6-yr trial were offered open-label fluvastatin in a 2-yr extension to the original study. The association between inflammation markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and IL-6 on cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality was investigated.
We investigated the sensitivity of Medicare billing claims for clinically verified cardiovascular diagnoses (five categories) and procedures (four categories) in a novel database linking Medicare claims to electronic medical records of one transplant program. Cardiovascular events identified in medical records for 571 Medicare-insured transplant recipients in 1991 through 2002 served as reference measures.
Data from 211 consecutive patients attending a university teaching hospital for a standard PET who had multifrequency bioimpedance performance were analyzed to determine which factors affected net PET ultrafiltration volumes.
We obtained long-term (&gt; or =1 yr) follow-up on 294 patients who participated in a randomized, double-blind comparison of two prevention strategies for CIN (iopamidol versus iodixanol). A difference in the incidence of AEs between patients who had developed CIN and those who had not was performed using a chi(2) test and Poisson regression analysis. A similar statistical approach was used for the differences in AEs between those who received iopamidol or iodixanol. Multiple definitions of CIN were used to strengthen and validate the results and conclusions.

Between 2001 and 2003, a survey was conducted in 64 sites to analyze the outcome of the first diagnostic angiography in patients presenting with stable angina pectoris (STAR registry). The clinical characteristics, initial angiographic findings, therapeutic strategy and outcome within the first year were analyzed.
Between 05/1986 and 12/2007, 1,163 endocarditis patients were operated upon. Of these, 221 patients (n = 185 men, median age 55 years) underwent homograft ARR due to 99 cases of NVE (45%) and 122 of PVE (55%) aortic root endocarditis. Demographics, clinical differences, survival rates and predictors of early mortality were analyzed. Follow-up (mean 5.2 +/- 0.4 years, maximum 18.4 years) was completed in 96.8% with a total of 1,127 patient years.
After valve sparing surgery in bicuspid aortic valve, a significant aorto-left atrial fistula was diagnosed in a 72-year-old patient causing heart failure and catecholamine-dependency. Due to the critical hemodynamic state, percutaneous closure was performed with an AGA Amplatzer duct occluder. Secondary to this closure, a second fistula between the aortic root and the right atrium appeared which was closed during the same procedure implanting a second duct occluder beneath the first device.
The authors review data concerning the effects of corticosteroid synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) in the management of depressive disorders, present a hypothesis as to their possible mechanisms of action based on recent data suggesting synergistic effects of glucocorticoids on extrahypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and consider alternative hypotheses. Published reports evaluating the efficacy of CSIs in treating depression are reviewed and presented in light of recent findings regarding actions of glucocorticoids on the central CRH system.
To investigate the mean remission time and the predictors associated with its duration; we performed a large retrospective, naturalistic study with 204 patients who underwent treatment with rTMS. During the periods from 2000 to 2006, we identified and collected the data on 204 patients who underwent rTMS treatment for major depression and who remitted their depression (defined as Hamilton Depression Rating Scores less or equal to 7). Patients were followed up to 6 months after this therapy.
Forty-six patients with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder were assigned to either MBCT or an anxiety disorder education (ADE) program for a period of 8 weeks. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) were used to assess the patients at 0 week and after the two programs had been running for 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) data were analyzed to calculate nationally representative estimates of Latino and non-Latino White adults antidepressant use.
The 48 coterminous United States was the setting.
Household residents aged 18 years and older (N=9,250).
We compared the demographic, clinical, and personality characteristics of patients (N=256) with major depressive disorder (MDD) receiving antidepressant medication or interpersonal therapy as part of an RCT investigation (n=105) versus in a clinic (n=151). The RCT and clinic protocols were identical with the exception of recruitment procedures (advertisement versus physician referral) and assignment to treatment (randomized versus nonrandomized).
Citalopram was delivered using measurement-based care and flexible dosing with the aim of achieving symptom remission. Symptom and side effect ratings were obtained at each treatment visit.
Worsened depression was defined as an exit score &gt;or=3 points above the pretreatment (baseline) score on the 16-item QIDS-SR. Baseline sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were examined for association with worsened depression.
A retrospective chart review was conducted on 11 treated patients between the ages of 6 and 17, with DSM-IV TTM.
50 patients with MDD received either STPP or FLX treatment for 16 weeks. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was the outcome measure completed at baseline and in the follow-ups at 4- and 12-months. Patients completed the Psychological Mindedness Scale (PMS) and the Defense Style Questionnaire at the baseline.
Forty adult outpatients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression participated in the trial. Patients have a baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of at least 18. Patients were allocated in a random fashion: 20 to fluoxetine 40 mg/day plus celecoxib 400 mg/day (200 mg bid) (morning and evening) and 20 to fluoxetine 40 mg/day plus placebo. Patients were assessed by a psychiatrist at baseline and after 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the medication started.
Medline, PsycInfo, SciSearch, SocScisearch, Cinhal, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched. Bibliographies of relevant book chapters and review articles and information from colleagues with expertise in anxiety were also a source of information. The search produced more than a thousand citations. Only eight studies met inclusion criteria: follow-up of a cohort of treated anxious youth for more than 2 years.
Thirty-two clients diagnosed with hoarding participated in five groups. Four groups met once weekly for 2 hour over 16 weeks (n=27) and one group met for 20 weeks (n=5). All participants had two individual 90-min home sessions. Self-report assessments were completed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment about hoarding behavior and related symptoms (e.g., depression). The sample was predominantly female, White, highly educated, unemployed, and not partnered/married; mean age was 53. A majority was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.
Outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder treated for up to 14 weeks with citalopram in the first step of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study were divided by household incomes of &lt;$20,000, $20,000-&lt;$40,000, and &gt;or=$40,000. Attrition rates and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of attrition were identified for each group.
A system dynamics methodology was used to develop a comprehensive causal simulator of the U.S. population and give proof of principle that entire portfolios of present and future technologies can be evaluated for direct and indirect impacts. An explicit semiquantitative methodology was used for surveying, prioritizing, and grouping C&amp;Cs, patient subgroups, and technologies, utilizing diverse publicly available clinical literature.
Individuals with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, recruited from a general and chronic illness panel, participated in a web-based survey that included questions about demographics, self-reported diagnoses and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), current IDS used, insulin therapy attitudes, current IDS features, and satisfaction with IDS. Univariate analyses identified variables associated with IDS satisfaction (P &lt; 0.05); those variables were entered into stepwise linear regression analyses with IDS satisfaction as the dependent variable.
Data were collected at the clinic over a 12-month period from February 2007 at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals. The clinic is jointly led by a consultant diabetologist and a diabetes specialist nurse within the secondary care setting.
We conducted a 1-year controlled parallel-group trial comparing patients randomized (1) to an intervention group, assigned to a teleassistance system using real-time transmission of blood glucose results, with immediate reply when necessary, and telephone consultations, or (2) to a control group, being regularly followed-up at their healthcare center. Study subjects were type 2 diabetes patients &gt;30 years of age followed in the primary care setting.
A population-based study examined all Ontario, Canada residents &gt; or = 66 years old who received a first prescription for insulin between 1998 and 2006 (n = 47,810). Associations between demographic/clinical factors and the use of pen devices for insulin delivery were determined.
In this study, the influence of in vitro transfection conditions on polyplexes constructed of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) on the transfection efficiency was investigated by varying the transfection medium, the pDNA dose, and the amines of polycation/phosphates of pDNA (N/P) ratio.
Seven adult female vervet (Chlorocebus aethiops) monkeys were maintained on an atherogenic Western diet. They were divided into two groups: four with NGT and three with IGT. Each subject underwent [18F]FBT PET twice: first, a baseline PET under fasting conditions; and second, PET under fasting conditions but after intravenous infusion of dextrose solution. Quantitative analysis of pancreatic uptake at 60 min post-injection was performed.
Glucose profiles of 27 Japanese people were measured for 4 days by using continuous glucose monitoring. A 75-g OGTT was conducted on the second day, and 24 subjects diagnosed with NGT by a 75-g OGTT were enrolled. The subjects were monitored for their postprandial glucose profile in their ordinary daily life on the third day.
Forty-five subjects whose average age was 31.2 +/- 8.3 years (younger group), 62.4 +/- 9.6 years (older group), and 61.8 +/- 11.3 years (diabetes group) were divided into three groups of 15 subjects. Subjects were exposed to environmental temperatures of 15 degrees C, 23 degrees C, or 32 degrees C for 30 min. During this period of time, sweat rate, skin blood flow, the electrodermal skin response, and skin moisture were measured.
A clinic-based colorectal frozen tumor bank at a single institution was queried for colon and rectal adenocarcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and analyzed for microsatellite instability, methylation, and mutations in the oncogenes KRAS and BRAF. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and clinical outcomes were compared.
Data were extracted from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland Colorectal Cancer Database (2000-2005). Social deprivation was assessed by using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2004) score. Logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of nonrestorative surgery.
Using data from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we analyzed patients with Stage II or III rectal cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy after curative rectal cancer surgery between 1991 and 2002. Logistic and Cox regressions were performed to assess determinants of adjuvant chemotherapy delays and outcomes in two cohorts: patients with access to medical oncology care because of prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Group A) and patients without such access (Group B). Length of postoperative hospital stay served as the main proxy for postsurgical recovery.

A set of clinical process indicators was developed using a structured process. The indicator set was implemented between January 2006 and December 2006, using strategies based on evidence about effectiveness and local contextual factors. Evaluation included a structured survey of general medical staff to assess awareness and attitudes towards the programme and qualitative assessment of barriers to implementation. Impact on documentation of adherence to clinical indicators was assessed by auditing a random sample of medical records before (2003-2005) and after (2006) implementation.
A literature search was undertaken to identify indicator sets. Indicators were included if they related to hospital care and were clearly being collected and reported to an external body. A two-person independent review was undertaken to classify indicators according to aspects of care provision (structure, process or outcome), dimensions of quality (safety, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, patient-centredness and equity), and domain of application (hospital-wide, surgical and non-surgical clinical specialities).
The study included 97 patients who had undergone concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement at Regions Hospital, University of Minnesota Medical School from January 2006 to December 2008.

Factors that might be associated with prescription of GPD with low-dose aspirin were assessed in multiple logistic regression models.
A total of 1,434 samples collected for HbA1c measurement at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital in southern Taiwan in March 2008 were submitted for Hb variant analysis by Primus CLC-385. HbA1c measurements were obtained using ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Tosoh HLC-723 G7) for routine analysis. Patients identified with Hb variants were recalled for boronate-affinity HPLC analysis. The values of estimated average glucose (eAG) were converted from HbA1c. Values of eAG-FPG, calculated by eAG minus fasting plasma glucose (FPG), were compared to estimate the accuracy of HbA1c measurement in patients with Hb variants.
Compositions including biochemical components and tumor markers were determined in human AF, umbilical cord serum (UCS) and maternal serum (MS) from the same subject in the range of 15-42 weeks of gestation.
Bovine enamel samples were submitted to a cyclic de- and remineralisation for 3 days. Each day, the samples were exposed for 120 min to pooled human saliva and subsequently treated with one of the fluoride solutions for 3 min: amine fluoride (AmF, 0.5% and 1% F(-)), sodium fluoride (NaF, 0.5% and 1% F(-)), each at pH 3.9 and 7.0, and stannous fluoride (SnF(2), 0.5% and 1% F(-)), at pH: 3.9. Additionally, two groups were treated with fluoride-free placebo solutions (pH: 3.9 and 7.0) and one group served as control (no fluoridation). Ten specimens each group were inserted in a so-called artificial mouth and eroded six times daily with hydrochloric acid (pH 2.6) for 90 s each intermitted by exposure to artificial saliva (1h). After 3 days, enamel loss was analyzed profilometrically and evaluated statistically by ANOVA.
Nanoindentation, Raman spectroscopes, and SEM were employed to compare the inner and outer regions of the cross-sectioned enamel from different angles, namely mechanical properties such as elastic modulus and hardness, indentation energy absorption ability, indentation creep ability, indentation residual stress distribution pattern, compositional differences, and microstructural differences.
Resin composites and shades used in this study were submicron-filled Estelite Sigma (Sigma: Inc, A2, A3, B3, C2, OA2, OA3) and nanofilled Filtek Supreme XT (XT: Clear, A2E, A2B, A3B, C2B, A2D, A3D). Resin disks of 2mm in thickness and final polish with 2400-grit silicon carbide paper were stored in 100% relative humidity. One-week and 1-year after curing, the colors of the composite disks were measured with a spectrophotometer in SCI and SCE modes.
Human premolar dentin was treated with one of the two self-etching adhesive systems, Clearfil SE Bond, Clearfil Protect Bond or an acid-etching adhesive system, Single Bond. The bonded interface was exposed to an artificial demineralizing solution (pH 4.5) for 90 min and then 5% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min. Transmission electron microscopic observation was performed at the adhesive-dentin interface. The width of the reinforced zone was measured and data were analyzed with univariate analysis of variance under general linear model. In order to identify type of crystallites in the reinforced zone selected area electron diffraction was performed.
One-dimensional (1)H STRAFI-MRI images (projections along an axis, profiles) were acquired from the adhesive with and without Aurora, before and after solvent removal. Specimens were observed after the irradiation period recommended by the manufacturers and new profiles were recorded. Extent of polymerization and volumetric contraction were obtained by subtracting the profile of the cured adhesive from the profile of the liquid; the profiles were previously normalized using an external reference signal and the highest magnetization intensity recorded from the cured adhesive, respectively. Data were obtained in the presence of oxygen. Solvent evaporation was measured by gravimetry.
30 human premolars were endodontically prepared and obturated with an epoxy sealer and vertically condensed gutta-percha. Thereafter the entire clinical crown was removed. The teeth were randomly assigned to five different composite core groups, all using the same fiber reinforced radicular post (DT White). Gr. 1: Optibond solo plus/Nexus II/Prodigy; Gr. 2: Scotchbond 1/Rely X Arc/Filtek P60; Gr. 3: EBS multi/Compolute applicap/Pertac II; Gr. 4: ART Bond/Parapost cement/Synergy; Gr. 5: Superbond C&amp;B catalyst S+polymer/Metafil CX. Polyvinyl-siloxane impressions of the external margins of the cores were readied before and after 1,200,000 cycles of mechanical loading with max. 100 N at 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the tooth. After loading, 5 of the 6 samples of each group were cut longitudinally and the sixth sample was cut transversally to be able to take replicas for evaluation of internal adaptation after loading.
One hundred and eighty onlays of different thicknesses (2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm) were luted with three different composites: two dual-curing cements (Variolink II and Calibra) and a light-curing composite (Venus). The same halogen lamp was used with three different modalities selected to provide a constant quantity of energy. The time/power combinations tested were 400 mW/cm(2) for 120 s, 800 mW/cm(2) for 60s and 1200 mW/cm(2) for 40 s. The light-curing composite was employed at room temperature and after preheating at 54 degrees C. Each sample was examined in three positions using the Micro-Raman Dilor HR LabRam spectrometer to evaluate the polymer conversion degree. The data were analysed using analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p=0.05).
80 vital molars of 25 patients were restored with all-ceramic PCRs (40 IPS e.max Press*[IP] and 40 ProCAD*[PC]). IP-PCRs were heat pressed following the lost-wax method. PC-PCRs were fabricated with Cerec 3** and Cerec InLab** CAD/CAM system (**Sirona Dental Systems, Bensheim, Germany). All PCRs were adhesively luted with a light-polymerizing composite (Syntac*/Tetric*) (*Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Clinical reevaluations were performed at baseline and 13, 25, and 36 months after insertion of the PCRs according to the modified United States Public Health Services (USPHS) criteria. Absolute failures were demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier survival rate.
Thirty-nine, endodontically treated, single canal, extracted human bicuspids were selected. Translucent fiber posts (RelyX Fiber Post) were luted into the root canal using three resinous luting systems (n=13). Dual-curing technique (DC): the specimens were treated with Excite DSC and RelyX ARC, which were light-cured simultaneously through the post for 60s. Self-adhesive dual-curing technique (SADC): the specimens were treated with RelyX Unicem, which was light-cured through the post for 60s. Light-curing technique (LC): the specimens were treated with Excite DSC and Tetric Flow, which were simultaneously light-cured through the post for 60s. The specimens were transversally sectioned into six slices in order to perform the push-out test. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer test for post-hoc comparisons at alpha=0.05.
RT-PCR, real time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to examine the expression of CENP-H in tongue cancer cell lines and biopsies. CENP-H protein level in paraffin-embedded tongue cancer tissues were tested by immunohistochemical staining and undergone statistical analysis. CENP-H-knockdown stable cell line was established by infecting cells with a retroviral vector pSuper-retro-CENP-H-siRNA. The biological function of CENP-H was tested by MTT assay, colony formation assay, and Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay.
The study design was a retrospective case analysis. In 508 patients who underwent LC in a tertiary referral university hospital from 1996 through 2007, difficult cholecystectomy was anticipated in 26 patients due to possibly aberrant biliary anatomy (four patients), unclear cystic duct anatomy during magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (three patients), and acute cholecystitis (19 patients). An ENBD was inserted during ERCP prior to LC for cholangiography (ENBDC) to facilitate safe dissection during LC. Prevalence of biliary complications was assessed as the main outcome measurement.
Of 116 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgery, 62 (43 men and 19 women, median age 69 years) underwent preoperative ENBD. After classification of lesions according to Bismuth-Corlette (B-C) criteria, we evaluated efficacy and safety with respect to B-C type.
We focused on a new mode of sonogram, real-time elastography, which can show tissue elasticity on images, and express the elasticity numerically. The elastic ratio of the liver for the intercostal muscle for each patient was calculated preoperatively, using the sonography device. The liver fibrosis stages were finally determined in the operative specimens from 41 patients. We examined the correlation between the elastic ratio and the histological fibrosis stage.
Between January 2008 and October 2008, 7 patients underwent one-stage laparoscopic resection for primary colorectal cancer combined with laparoscopic or robot-assisted liver resection.
Forty-seven male Wistar albino rats were randomized into seven experimental groups. In group I, animals were sham-operated (n = 5). In groups II, III, IV, IIepo, IIIepo, and IVepo, AP was induced by sodium taurodeoxycholate treatment (n = 7). In groups II, III, and IV, 1 ml normal saline and in groups IIepo, IIIepo, and IVepo, 1000 U/kg body weight erythropoietin (EPO) was administered intramuscularly immediately after the induction of AP. Animals were killed at 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively. Histopathological and biochemical evaluations were performed.

Of 64 patients who underwent right-sided hepatectomy for hilar biliary cancer, the portal bifurcation was routinely resected by the above new procedure in 25 patients, based on preoperative imaging diagnoses. Perioperative outcomes were compared with those in patients who underwent conventional portal reconstruction (n = 18) and with those in patients who had preservation of the portal bifurcation (n = 21).
Micrometastases around liver metastases were examined microscopically in 31 metastatic liver tumor specimens resected from 17 patients who had undergone hepatic resection for liver metastases from gastric cancer. E-cadherin and MMP-7 expression in the primary gastric tumor, the liver metastases, and the micrometastases were examined immunohistochemically.
Obstructive jaundice was induced in rats by the ligation and division of the common bile duct. Four days after the operation, intestinal anastomosis was performed, and either calcitonin gene-related peptide or 0.9% NaCl was administered intraperitoneally to these jaundiced rats and controls. The concentrations of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and triglyceride levels of all rats were measured, and healing of the anastomosis was evaluated by measuring the bursting pressure and hydroxyproline content on the 7th postoperative day.

A total of 62 patients who had been diagnosed with spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma were managed in our hospital during this period.
Our study included 172 consecutive patients who had major liver resection with selective hepatic vascular exclusion and sharp transection of the liver parenchyma. An intraoperative maneuver (5 s occlusion of the hepatic vein) was applied in an alternating way, and the patients were assigned to two groups: Cohort A (n = 86), that was granted the maneuver, and Cohort B (n = 86), that was used as a control group.
We analyzed initial results from the viewpoint of operative techniques of laparoscopic liver resection in our series. Laparoscopic liver resections have been successfully performed by the application of automatic suturing devices and the radiofrequency method.
A questionnaire survey was conducted at 26 hospitals to determine the operative procedures, rates of conversion to open surgery, and morbidity rates in patients who had undergone laparoscopic hepatectomy and endoscopic ablation therapy.
Based on a large review of the literature as well as on our personal experience the authors define clearly: the feasibility and the effectiveness of LLS 2 and 3.
Studies about LLR published before September 2008 were identified and their results summarized.
One hundred patients with CRT implants and suitable baseline echocardiograms were identified. Longitudinal rotation was assessed in the apical 4-chamber view by speckle-tracking techniques and myocardial systolic velocities for basal septum, and lateral LV were analyzed from tissue Doppler images. The quartiles of LR distribution were analyzed for differences in their systolic velocities. Correlation between measurements and reduction in LV end-systolic volume (ESV) at follow-up was performed.
Echocardiograms in 1,591 patients with asymptomatic AS (67 +/- 10 years, 51% hypertensive) at baseline in the SEAS (Simvastatin Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) study evaluating placebo-controlled combined simvastatin and ezetimibe treatment in AS were used to assess LV global load as valvuloarterial impedance and LV myocardial function as stress-corrected midwall shortening. The study population was divided into tertiles of global load. Stress-corrected midwall shortening was considered low if &lt;87% in men and &lt;90% in women. Low-flow AS was defined as stroke volume index &lt;22 ml/m(2.04).
In all, 1,256 consecutive patients with suspected CAD undergoing 64-slice CCTA in our institution between October 2004 and September 2006 were observed prospectively for the occurrence of severe cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization: primary study end point) and all cardiac events (additionally including revascularization &gt;90 days after CCTA). The observed rate of all cardiac events was compared with the event rate predicted by the Framingham risk score. Obstructive CAD was defined as &gt; or = 50% diameter stenosis in any coronary artery.
Ten porcine models of acute MI were imaged 10 days after MI using prospective and retrospective ECG-gated DCE-MDCT (64-slice) 10 min after a 90-ml contrast bolus. The MDCT images were analyzed using a semiautomated computed tomography density (CTD) threshold technique. Infarct size, signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios, contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios, and image quality metrics were compared between the 2 ECG-gating techniques.
Myocardial perfusion measurements at rest and adenosine stress were performed on 81 patients (75.6% male, mean age 64.2 years) with stable angina pectoris (AP) and coronary artery stenoses of intermediate angiographic severity (50% to 75%). Regardless of the CMR result, all patients were treated conservatively with an intensified medical treatment, and a follow-up was performed after 18 +/- 8 months and 30 +/- 8 months. The primary end point was defined as a major adverse cardiac event (MACE): all-cause death, stroke, acute coronary syndrome; the secondary end point was defined as target vessel revascularization. Furthermore, AP and dyspnea were evaluated.
In all, 78 patients (age 66 +/- 8 years; 71 men) underwent CMR imaging including left ventricular function, first-pass adenosine stress perfusion (adenosine 140 microg/min/kg) using 0.05 mmol/kg body weight gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid and an additional 0.15 mmol/kg for LGE 1 day before invasive coronary angiography. Images were analyzed visually using the speed of contrast wash-in and maximal signal intensity. Transmural LGE defects of the size of a vessel or graft territory defined by angiography were considered true negatives, even when supplied by a stenosed/occluded vessel/graft. Stenoses &gt;50% in grafts and grafted or ungrafted native vessels (diameter &gt; or =2 mm) in invasive angiography were considered significant.
The study enrolled 854 consecutive patients undergoing mechanical reperfusion therapy for first MI. Paired (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy studies (acute and 7 to 14 days after reperfusion) were used to calculate myocardial salvage index. DC and TS were assessed from Holter recordings 7 to 14 days after reperfusion. Patients were categorized into 3 groups by salvage index: &lt;30% (n = 244), 30% to 60% (n = 257), and &gt; or =60% (n = 353).
Eighty consecutive patients (29 stable and 51 unstable angina) with normal pre-PCI cTnI levels were imaged before PCI using VH-IVUS. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence (Group I, n = 38) or absence (Group II, n = 42) of post-PCI cTnI elevation &gt; or =3x the upper limit of normal (0.08 ng/ml).
From 30 patients imaged with IVUS-VH and OCT, 103 bifurcations were selected. The main branch was analyzed at the proximal rim of the ostium of the side branch, at the in-bifurcation segment and at the distal rim of the ostium of the side branch. Plaques with more than 10% confluent necrotic core by IVUS-VH were selected and classified as fibroatheroma (FA) or thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) depending on the thickness of the fibrous cap by OCT (&gt;65 or &lt; or =65 microm for FA and TCFA, respectively).
We used immunohistochemical staining for syndecan-1 and tenascin antibodies in tumor tissue samples.
Helsinki University Central Hospital.
Tissue material came from 33 patients undergoing surgery from 1979 to 2005 for cystic pancreatic tumors.
ERCP records of 3,827 patients satisfying inclusion criteria between 1985 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed.
Patients demonstrating anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction were identified and classified according to the new Komi classification.
We searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, ETOH and AIM. Studies were included if they reported quantifiable information on risk and related confidence intervals with respect to at least three different levels of alcohol intake.
Two patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer progressed on gemcitabine, capecitabine and docetaxel (GTX). When sirolimus was added to this regimen at a dosage to achieve a serum level of at least 10 ng/dL at the time of the gemcitabine and docetaxel infusion, their tumors regressed.
We report an extremely rare case of pancreatic metastases in a 20-year-old man who had a right nephroblastoma resected at 9 years of age and liver metastases treated by right hepatectomy at 18 years of age. Pancreatic metastasis was revealed by acute pancreatitis. Imaging studies revealed one 2 cm nodule in the pancreatic head with upstream dilatation of the Wirsung duct. Imaging studies revealed no other localization except a 1.5 cm liver nodule. Surgical resection was performed without preoperative chemotherapy because the patient was symptomatic and had already received numerous chemotherapy protocols. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and limited liver resection with an uneventful postoperative course. Pathological examination confirmed pancreatic and liver metastases from a nephroblastoma composed of blastematous cells mixed with embryonic tubular structures without lymph node metastases. After resection, the patient received adjuvant high dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell support. After a 21-month follow-up, the patient was in good general condition but had liver recurrence without intra-pancreatic recurrence.
We report a very rare case of an intrapancreatic accessory spleen which radiologically and cytologically mimicked a neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor.
The patient came to our hospital for a revaluation of a cystic pancreatic lesion. Ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) examinations were carried out. A small cystic lesion of about 1.5 cm in diameter was seen in the posterior aspect of the pancreatic uncinate process A very small, solid, vascularized nodule was detected at CEUS within the lesion. Consequently, the patient underwent CT and MRI. MRI confirmed the presence of an intralesional nodule and communication with the main pancreatic duct was demonstrated, suggesting the diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with solid intralesional tissue. A pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was carried out. An undifferentiated adenocarcinoma having a notable peripheral inflammatory reaction and dilated branch duct was finally diagnosed.
We describe two cases of lymphoepithelial cysts where a diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst was made using EUS guided Trucut biopsy.
We report the case of a patient in whom a lesion was detected in the head of the pancreas, following a nephrectomy performed 5 years previously for renal cell carcinoma. A magnetic resonance scan revealed a well-defined lesion in the head of the pancreas. The patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy and histopathology confirmed a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Two years after the surgery, the patient is doing well. The literature is reviewed for pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma, for metastatic pattern, surgical management and outcome.
We report the case of a 45-year-old female with heterotopic pancreas in the jejunum who presented with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and had a submucosal lesion on endoscopy. As she had undergone gastrojejunostomy in the past, the lesion in the jejunum could be diagnosed on endoscopy by entering the efferent loop.
A 60-year-old man with a history of chronic pancreatitis presents with a clinical and laboratory picture suggestive of acute exacerbation of his pancreatitis. A computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst and a cystic lesion involving both lobes of the liver. CT diagnostic aspiration of the intrahepatic cyst revealed high amylase level (greater than 20,000 U/L). The cyst was treated with percutaneous drainage with complete resolution of the cyst.
Two patients with both extensive injury of the duodenum and diffuse peritonitis underwent pancreas preserving total duodenectomy at our tertiary care centre. These two young male patients (age 20 and 22 years) presented 2 days and 6 hours respectively following blunt abdominal trauma. The duodenum was almost completely separated from the pancreas. Ampulla was seen as a button on the pancreas. Following total duodenectomy, reconstruction was performed by suturing the jejunum to the head of the pancreas anteriorly and posteriorly away from the ampulla (invagination of the pancreas into the jejunum). There were no complications attributable to the procedure. Both patients are well on follow up.
The first patient was a young woman with an incidental 3 cm cyst located in the pancreatic head who underwent enucleation. The second patient was a young woman with a large 8 cm symptomatic cyst located in the pancreatic tail who underwent a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Histological examination revealed fibrous walls lined by a monolayer of cuboidal epithelium in both cases.
An 80-year-old Japanese man presented with obstructive jaundice owing to a hepatic hilum bile duct stricture. Coincidentally, a soft tissue mass surrounding the abdominal aorta, suggesting retroperitoneal fibrosis, was identified. Unexpectedly, spontaneous regression of obstructive jaundice together with retroperitoneal fibrosis occurred. The presence of high serum IgG4 concentrations measured later led us to consider a possible association with autoimmune pancreatitis; however, there were no clinical features confirming autoimmune pancreatitis. After a 5-year history of spontaneous clinical remission, there was an elevation of serum IgG4 levels and renal dysfunction owing to bilateral hydronephrosis caused by a reemergence of the retroperitoneal mass. Evaluation by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a biliary stricture, suggesting sclerosing cholangitis which was observed without the presence of any pancreatic duct abnormality. The subsequent excellent results obtained using steroid therapy, namely the decrease in serum IgG4 levels and the regression of the retroperitoneal mass, strongly suggested that the present case was an IgG4-related sclerosing disease. Aside from high serum IgG4 concentrations, markedly elevated levels of serum IgE was found retrospectively, although the clinical significance remains unknown.
We report the computed tomography findings of a rare case of pancreatic metastasis in a 14-year-old boy with primary vertebral osteosarcoma being followed-up for 6 years. On abdominal CT, a huge mass containing necrotic and calcified areas and causing bone destruction was seen between thoracic vertebra 7 and sacral vertebra 1 involving both the vertebrae and paravertebral soft-tissue. A large metastatic mass with an irregular contour was also visualized in the pancreatic head and peripancreatic region having tomographic findings similar to the vertebral mass. Tru-cut biopsy of the pancreatic mass confirmed the diagnosis of osteosarcoma metastasis.
We report a case of pseudoaneurysmal rupture of the common hepatic artery into the biliodigestive anastomosis. A 55 year old female patient with a history of pancreatic head cancer underwent a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy at our hospital in September 2008. Six days postoperatively the patient underwent surgery because of sentinel bleeding of a portal vein branch. On the 40th postoperative day she presented melena. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy indicated bleeding near the biliodigestive anastomosis. An emergency angiography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the common hepatic artery. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed and a hemodynamic stabilization of the patient was achieved. Six days after the embolization the patient developed hemorrhagic shock and an urgent relaparotomy was carried out. The explorative laparotomy revealed bleeding of the common hepatic artery into the biliodigestive anastomosis in the form of an arteriointestinal fistula. The anastomosis was opened, the ruptured pseudoaneurysm was sutured, and a new biliodigestive anastomosis was made. The patient has been well for two months with good liver function, without rebleeding.
This is a single case study of a 58-year-old female with chronic pancreatitis undergoing longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy for pain relief. Fifteen months after the surgery, the patient experienced pain recurrence. Radiologic evaluation followed by surgical exploration revealed a gastroenteric fistula to the Roux-limb, with obliteration of the anastomosis. After repair of the fistula and re-excavation of the pancreatic head, a two-layer longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy was reconstructed from the same Roux-limb. An omental flap was interposed between the Roux limb and the repaired stomach. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was pain free and asymptomatic.
We report a case of reconstruction of the superior mesenteric-portal vein with a splenic vein autograft in a patient affected by pancreatic head adenocarcinoma who underwent a total pancreatectomy.
A total of 537 patients underwent allo-HSCT for the treatment of leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and solid tumor. HBV serologic markers were examined in both recipients and donors prior to and following the transplantation. The mean follow-up period was 36.6 months (range 3-80 months).
A total of 510 HBsAg (+) or HBeAg (+) serum samples was collected from subjects in several cities and harbors throughout the Korean peninsula for genotype (A-G)-specific multiplex PCR analysis. Another 40 serum samples from chronic HBV carriers from Iksan city were selected for sequencing of the entire HBV genome. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with 22 whole genomic sequences of Korean HBV strains enrolled in GenBank.
Among 886 cases with HCC that had been diagnosed at Chonnam National University Hospital from January 2002 to December 2007, 62 cases (7.0%) with ruptured HCC were studied retrospectively regarding their clinical characteristics and prognostic factors.
From January 1989 to September 2008, 12 patients were diagnosed with hepatic tuberculosis by liver biopsy at Seoul National University Hospital. We retrospectively evaluated their clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings by medical record review.
Seventy-six children with chronic hepatitis B who were seropositive for HBeAg were treated with lamivudine for at least 6 months. HBeAg seroconversion occurred during treatment in 49 of these children, who were then followed up to assess their clearance of serum HBsAg. Various clinical variables were compared between those patients who were cleared of HBsAg and those who were not, including age, pretreatment serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, treatment duration, the time elapsed between initiation of treatment and ALT normalization, HBV DNA negativization, HBeAg seroconversion, and HBsAg clearance.
Nucleos(t)ide-naive (group A, n=196) and lamivudine-experienced (serum hepatitis B virus, HBV DNA &gt;2,000 copies/mL without resistant mutants at the start of clevudine therapy, group B, n=75) patients were included in this study. Basic clinical characteristics including age, sex, the presence of cirrhosis, laboratory data, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBeAg) positivity were similar between the two groups. Pretreatment serum levels of HBV DNA were 7.4 and 6.6 log(10) copies/mL (P&lt;0.001). The mean treatment duration was 8 months for both groups (range for group A: 3-21 months; range for group B: 3-20 months). Genotypic analysis for resistant mutations in the reverse transcriptase of HBV was performed after viral breakthrough.
This is an observational study of a cohort of patients infected by genotype 2/3 HCV. IDUs and patients with psychiatric diseases were not excluded from treatment. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis to evaluate factors related to treatment failure.
A 64-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted to hospital with severe bleeding from oesophageal varices. Ultrasonography showed ascites, but no dilatation of the biliary tree. The skin, sclerae, plasma, urine and ascites of the patient showed a greenish appearance. Bilirubin levels were normal, and there were no signs of haemolysis. Biliverdin was analysed in plasma and urine with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The seven exonic regions of the biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced.
Liver slides and clinical charts from autopsied diabetics from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed. Exclusions were nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis of any cause, cardiac sclerosis and marked autolysis.
The GPC3 expression was categorized into three patterns - one with GPC3-negative staining and two with GPC3-positive staining (one with unclear membrane staining and one with clear membrane staining, designated GPC3+/C). The number of macrophages that were stained with resident macrophage (rMvarphi) or pan-macrophage (pMvarphi) markers was counted for each GPC3 expression pattern.
A cohort of 119 consecutively recruited chronic hepatitis C-infected patients was studied. Patients' sera were assessed for S. mansoni antibodies and cryoglobulins (CGs) were determined and characterized.
We compared the prevalence and incidence of thyroid dysfunction (TD) in a series of patients with PBC (n=67) with patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (n=79) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n=97) seen in a tertiary referral centre who had previously participated in clinical trials.
We determined the expression of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors on normal and malignant (Mz-ChA-1) cholangiocytes and human cholangiocarcinoma tissue and the effect of ET-1 on the proliferation and expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C (regulators of tumour angiogenesis) and its receptors, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, in Mz-ChA-1 cells. In vivo, Mz-ChA-1 cells were injected into the flanks of athymic mice and injections of ET-1 or saline into the tumours were performed daily. The effect of ET-1 on tumour size, cell proliferation, apoptosis, collagen quantity and the expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 were measured after 73 days.
We performed 68% hepatectomy, comparing UTI (-/-) and UTI (+/+) mice. Recovery of liver weight was recorded and we calculated labelling indices after 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry. A DNA microarray was used to examine gene expression followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) were measured.
We performed a retrospective analysis of 213 patients with cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation. Patients with serum sodium &lt;or=130 mEq/L immediately before transplantation ('hyponatraemia at OLT'; n=34) were compared with those who had experienced hyponatraemia but subsequently improved to a serum sodium &gt;130 mEq/L at transplantation ('resolved hyponatraemia'; n=56) and to those without history of hyponatraemia before transplantation ('never hyponatraemic'; n=123). Primary endpoint was survival at 180 days post-OLT. Secondary outcomes included time until discharge alive, complications during hospitalization, length of time ventilated and length of post-transplant intensive care unit stay.
Eighty-one consecutive non-diabetic chronic hepatitis C patients (37 men and 44 women, mean age of 51.9+/-12.2 years) and 40 age, sex and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy individuals were collected. IR was evaluated by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Serum levels of cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
One hundred and sixty-seven NAFLD patients [106 with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and 61 with simple steatosis] with a positive diagnosis by liver biopsy and 435 healthy control subjects were recruited in this study.
In this study, hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of control and HIF-1alpha- or HIF-1beta-deficient mice and exposed to hypoxia.
Seventy-two patients were randomly placed into TIPS-LBPV (36 patients) and TIPS-RBPV (36 patients, with four failures) groups, and they were prospectively followed for 2 years after TIPS implantation.
C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient high-fat diet (MCDHF) or a standard diet with/without the administration of Tel (10 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks.
Chronic hepatitis-associated fibrosis was induced in 13 Smad3 null and 13 wild-type (WT) mice by intraperitoneal DMN administration (10 microg/g body weight/day) for three consecutive days per week for 6 weeks. The liver was excised for macroscopic examination and histological, morphometric and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. For IHC, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen types I-III, TGF-beta1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Smad3, Smad7 and CD3 antibodies were used.
Eight patients with compensated or very early decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) &gt;10 mmHg, received 2 months of VSL#3 (3600 billion bacteria daily). The HVPG, intestinal permeability, endotoxin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, renin and aldosterone were measured at baseline and study end.
Adult dogs received an intravenous injection of low-dose adenoviral vectors encoding human HGF and VEGF (HGF/VEGF), beta-galactosidase (lacZ) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Liver proliferation was measured using the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining labelling index. HGF and VEGF plasma concentrations and transaminases were repeatedly measured. Transgene expression was evaluated using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
This study uses a household survey to assess the determinants of demand for bed nets in an area of endemic malaria transmission in rural, southern Mozambique. The study looks at willingness to pay (WTP) for bed nets, net ownership, usage, and past purchase behaviour, alongside expenditure and frequency of use of alternate methods for malaria prevention.
A retrospective review of the strategic response required to treat patients with bushfire-related injury in the first 72 hours of the Victorian bushfires that began on 7 February 2009. Emergency department (ED) presentations and initial management of patients presenting to the state's adult burns centre (The Alfred Hospital [The Alfred]) were analysed, as well as injuries and deaths associated with the fires.

A prospective cohort study.
Venous blood samples were collected from 140 Rhesus (Rh) D-negative women booked for antenatal care in two tertiary maternity hospitals in Sydney and Brisbane between November 2006 and April 2008. Cell-free DNA, including free maternal and fetal DNA, was extracted from maternal plasma in the tertiary Australian Red Cross Blood Service laboratory, and three exon regions of the RHD gene were amplified.
Comparison of the predicted fetal RHD status and the infant's RhD serotype. Secondary analysis involved using SRY and RASSF1A assays as internal controls to confirm the presence of fetal DNA in RHD-negative samples.
We studied 296 subjects recruited from the general population, equally distributed according to sex and aged between 20 and 70 years. Serum IGF-I level was measured in all subjects and an insulin tolerance test (0.15 U/kg Actrapid iv) and GHRH/GHRP-6 test (1 microg GHRH/kg and 1 microg GHRP-6/kg) were performed in 49 subjects.
Individual and combined associations of NSAIDs and CYP2C9*2 and *3 variant alleles with colorectal cancer were studied in 7757 Caucasian individuals of The Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort since 1990. Additive and multiplicative effect modification models were used to examine drug-gene interactions.
Patients were 36 persons with SM diagnosed according to WHO criteria. Controls were 31 patients without SM. Immunophenotyping was performed according to published guidelines.

In a longitudinal cohort study tumour stages were assessed in 144 symptomatic (mean age 69.3 years, 56% male) and 41 asymptomatic colorectal cancer patients (mean age 64.9 years, 56% male) of which 11 were detected with guaiac FOBT s (G-FOBT, Hemoccult-II) and 30 with immunochemical FOBTs (I-FOBT, OCSensor). Stage distributions were used to calculate average stage specific predicted five-year survival rates and to analyse group differences with Wilcoxon log-rank test.
A 79-year-old female with RCC presented with low-grade fever, weight loss and overt granulocytosis and thrombocytosis. Radiological examination revealed a right-sided renal tumour. During nephrectomy a gradient between the IL-6 levels in the renal artery and vein was demonstrated, providing direct evidence for in vivo production of IL-6 by the tumour affected kidney, which was confirmed by the demonstration of IL -6 in the tumour cells by immunohistochemical staining and in the supernatant of the homogenised tumour. Cytogenetic examination revealed complex abnormalities including a gain of chromosome 7. In addition we demonstrated production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8 and ICAM-1 in the tumour with systemic elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-8 with secondary increased serum G-CSF and TPO levels.
Data were obtained retrospectively on 22 patients treated with conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia. End points evaluated included time to [Na] increase of &gt;or=6 meq/l; incidences of rapid overcorrection of [Na] (defined as an increase of &gt;12 meq/l in a 24-h period while on conivaptan), infusion site reactions, or other adverse events; and whether sodium levels decreased after discontinuation of conivaptan.
The efficacy of intermittent bolus doses of conivaptan to correct hyponatremia was examined in a consecutive series of patients treated in our neurointensive care unit. Patients were excluded if baseline sodium was over 135 mEq/l or if another conivaptan dose was given within 12 h. We assessed the proportion responding with a 4 or 6 mEq/l rise in sodium by 12 h, the change in sodium from baseline, and, in those not receiving another dose for at least 72 h, the long-term ability of a single dose to maintain sodium at least 4 mEq/l above baseline. We also recorded the effects of conivaptan on urine output and specific gravity, and noted any adverse events.
Collected data included age, sex, therapy indication and duration, dosing regimen, documented seizure activity, ICU admission diagnoses, length of ICU stay, serum creatinine, liver function tests, adverse reactions, concomitant use of other AEDs, and drug interactions.
Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
Tertiary care neurocritical care unit.
Sixty-seven mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving continuous intravenous sedation with propofol.
Sedation monitoring using clinical assessment with the Ramsay scale (Ramsay-alone group) or clinical assessment plus BIS monitoring (BIS-augmentation group). Subjects were randomized to Ramsay-alone (n = 35), or BIS-augmentation (n = 32). Nurses adjusted the dose of propofol to a Ramsay of 4, or a Ramsay of 4 and BIS between 60 and 70.
We prospectively enrolled patients with spontaneous ICH without underlying vascular malformation or neoplasm. We recorded clinical data and the proximate mechanism of death (BD, withdrawal of life support, cardiovascular death, or other cause). Time to death was compared with Kaplan-Meier methods (log-rank test). Data are median (IQR).
We analyzed one-year data (2005-2006) from the Premier database which is a nationally representative hospital discharge database containing data pertaining to admissions in the United States. We compared discharge outcomes, length of stay, and cost of hospitalization between groups of patients who were treated using either intravenous nicardipine or nitroprusside infusion. Chi-square and ANOVA were used for univariate analysis. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for baseline risk of mortality between the two groups.
This retrospective, single-center cohort study included adult patients admitted to the NSICU between January 2001 and July 2004 with a primary diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients and VTE events were identified using ICD-9 codes. All patients received low-dose unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin and intermittent pneumatic compression device. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient characteristics.
A 67-year-old male underwent lumbar laminectomy followed by parathyroidectomy. Postoperatively, he was comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale of 7) and underwent extensive neurological evaluation. Brain computed tomography (CT) imaging and CT angiography revealed no ischemia, vessel occlusion, or hemorrhage. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed only slowing of cerebral hemispheric activity bilaterally. Over the next 48 h, his mental status slowly improved and the patient made a full neurological recovery (Glasgow Coma Scale 15).
A 28-year-old male was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision suffering a severe TBI and polytrauma. He required significant volume resuscitation. Intensive care unit course was complicated by shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilator associated pneumonia, and development of intracranial hypertension (IH). Data were collected by retrospective chart review.
Consecutive ischemic stroke patients presenting &lt;3 h from symptom onset with major vessel occlusion on CT angiogram (CTA) were randomly assigned to IV TPA (per NINDS protocol) or IA TPA (22 mg over 2 h). Demographics, times to presentation and thrombolysis, presenting NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) and 90-day NIHSS, Barthel Index, and modified Rankin Scale were recorded. CT-scans at 24-h were reviewed for presence of hemorrhage. Recanalization was determined by post-procedure MR angiograms, which are obtained the day after thrombolytic therapy.
Retrospective review of patients who experienced angiographically negative SAH at our institution over the past 6 years was undertaken. The patients were stratified based on grade at presentation, severity, and pattern of SAH on initial non-enhanced, computed tomography (CT) of the head into perimesencephalic and diffuse subtypes. The patients were further differentiated based on the development of vasospasm, hydrocephalus and required treatments, and clinical outcomes. Patients were excluded if a causative lesion was discovered subsequently.
Case-report.
We analyzed data from the placebo arm of the Cerebral Hemorrhage and NXY-059 Trial (CHANT), an international multicenter randomized trial of a potential neuroprotectant that enrolled patients within 6 h of the onset of acute ICH. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether early AED use was associated with poor outcome at day 90, defined as a modified Rankin Scale of 5 or 6 (severely disabled or dead).
A comparative cohort study of 21 adult patients with severe TBI (GCS &lt;or= 8) treated with induced normothermia [36-36.5 degrees C rectal probe setting; intravascular cooling catheter (CoolLine, Alsius Corporation, Irvine, CA)] were matched by age, gender, and severity of injury to 21 historical control severe TBI patients treated with conventional fever control methods. ICP was measured via an external ventricular catheter and time duration for ICP &gt; 25 mmHg was calculated for the initial 72-h monitoring period. Non-parametric rank tests were performed.
We studied a patient who developed a sudden onset of slurred speech, right hemiplegia, and decreased level of arousal. Two days later CT scan showed a massive cerebral infarct, involving the left MCA territory.
Although numerous guideline statements exist regarding the management of blood pressure in these patients, most recommendations are based largely on Class III evidence. Further, there are few randomized controlled trials comparing vasopressor agents in these patients and selection is often guided by expert consensus.
Prospectively, blood glucose and cerebral metabolism, measured by cerebral microdialysis, were evaluated in 178 patients (WFNS grade I-V; age 51.6 +/- 12.4 years) during days 1-7 after SAH. Patients were classified into groups with mean blood glucose levels &lt;or=/&gt; 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl) and 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl). Glasgow Outcome Score was assessed after 12 months.
Clinical and radiological information on adult SAH patients were reviewed. Patients were grouped based on the time elapsed from ictus to the initial head CT study. The amount of subarachnoid blood on CT was graded using the Hijdra sum score (HSS) and the modified Fisher scale (MFS). The relationship between the initial CT grading score and the risk of angiographic vasospasm was assessed for each group.

Cross-sectional survey.
Three hospitals located in eastern Australia.
175 patients with breast cancer.
A survey, based on Protection Motivation Theory, was used to assess whether treatment variables, demographic variables, arm advice, fear, or coping attributes predicted women's intentions to avoid strenuous arm activity.
Intention to avoid strenuous arm activity, presence of arm or chest symptoms, receipt of arm care advice, and fear of lymphedema.
A secondary analysis was conducted using data from three pilot studies that tested a theory-based intervention to improve symptom management in older breast cancer survivors.
Advanced practice nurses conducted open-ended interviews with older breast cancer survivors either in their homes or via telephone.
Participants were recruited from the community, an oncology clinic, and a state tumor registry. The women (N = 61, X age = 69.5) were an average of 4.7 years after breast cancer diagnosis and reported an average of 17 symptoms.
Content analysis was conducted with field notes taken during baseline interviews.
Symptom representations, symptom management strategies, and perceived barriers to symptom management.
DNA samples from 100 subjects were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, followed by digestion with restriction endonucleases.
The authors present three cases, and review the etiology, clinical features, presumed pathomechanism and the possibilities of treatment.
During the study period 2005-2008 (4 years) we followed 5869 pregnancies. Retrospectively, 172 (2.9%) patients met the criteria of metabolic syndrome at the time of the first trimester.
1. Multifocal hemorrhagic infarcts of the brain, caused by generalized aspergillosis in mantle cell malignant lymphoma. 2. Cerebral microabscesses, caused by systemic candidiasis in a premature infant. 3. Fatal actinomycosis, mimicking a space occupying tumour in the thigh and with an abscess in the brain, radiologically indicated as a metastasis. The cause of death was actinomycotic pneumonia. 4. A successfully treated and recovered patient with recurrent pneumonia and multiplex brain abscesses, caused by filamentous microorganism of a Nocardia species revealed by histological examination of the neurosurgical specimen.
Total of 440 patients, 206 with Crohn's disease, 234 with ulcerative colitis, and 279 controls were studied by PCR-RFLP methods.
A total of 94 patients diagnosed with cervical dystonia (n=33), blepharospasm (n=32), or hemifacial spasm (n=29) were treated. The mean age of the patients was 62.4 years, and the mean duration of the therapy was 6.8 years. The medication took place with local injection of botulinum toxin type A. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed with Patient Global Impression scale. The authors also evaluated the side effects and complications of the therapy, as well as the causes of the treatment discontinuation.
From 1999 to 2008, MSF provided free diagnosis, etiological treatment, and follow-up care for patients &lt;18 years of age seropositive for T. cruzi in Yoro, Honduras (1999-2002); Olopa, Guatemala (2003-2006); Entre R√≠os, Bolivia (2002-2006); and Sucre, Bolivia (2005-2008). Essential program components guaranteeing feasibility of implementation were information, education, and communication (IEC) at the community and family level; vector control; health staff training; screening and diagnosis; treatment and compliance, including family-based strategies for early detection of adverse events; and logistics. Chagas disease diagnosis was confirmed by testing blood samples using two different diagnostic tests. T. cruzi-positive patients were treated with benznidazole as first-line treatment, with appropriate counseling, consent, and active participation from parents or guardians for daily administration of the drug, early detection of adverse events, and treatment withdrawal, when necessary. Weekly follow-up was conducted, with adverse events recorded to assess drug safety. Evaluations of serological conversion were carried out to measure treatment effectiveness. Vector control, entomological surveillance, and health education activities were carried out in all projects with close interaction with national and regional programs.
Mouthwash-derived DNA was extracted from 500 subjects participating in a genetic study of high myopia. DNA quality was investigated using two standard techniques: agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Whole-genome DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression and CNAs in a collection of 52 widely-used breast cancer cell lines, and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast tumors. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify gene-expression subtypes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to discover biological features of those subtypes. Genomic and transcriptional profiles were integrated to discover within high-amplitude CNAs candidate cancer genes with coordinately altered gene copy number and expression.
60 clinicians of different grades and from different specialities were randomly recruited to interpret 15 CXRs within 30 min. Radiographs included normal (n = 5) and abnormal images of common medical emergencies (n = 10). Non-parametric statistical tests examined for significant differences in the ability of different grades and specialities of doctors to interpret CXRs.
Cases with a clinical diagnosis of Chikungunya and Dengue fever were recruited for seroconfirmation during a concurrent epidemic in 2006-07, at the General Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.
Prospective observational study in a university teaching hospital of 90 consecutive patients admitted to secondary care over an 18 month period with acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar cellulitis or quinsy were studied. The geographical distribution by postcode, pre-admission history and treatment of each patient was recorded. The patients' general practitioners (GPs) were questioned about the patients' history, their use of antibiotics and prescribing guidelines and a patient questionnaire was completed. The result of hospital admission including throat swabs and blood cultures were recorded together with their treatment and outcome.
Mouthguards were fabricated on a fully dentate maxillary cast with 4-mm thick ethylene vinyl acetate sheets using a well-dried cast (VD) and on a wet cast (VW) with a vacuum-forming machine. Mouthguards were also made with a pressure-forming machine (P). The mouthguard outline was set at 4 mm from the cervical margin (control, C), the palatal outline was set at the cervical margin (Pa), and the buccal outline was extended to the buccal fold (Bu). A dislodging force perpendicular to the occlusal plane was applied at the first molar on the universal testing machine. Results were analyzed using ANOVA with Scheffe's test (P &lt; .05).
Micro?computed tomography data were used to generate finite-element models with a mesio-occlusaldistal (MOD) cavity preparation and the corresponding restoration. The tooth parts were imported in finite-element software to create 3D volumetric models. Occlusal loading either in enamel, at restoration margin, or in restorative material was simulated by linear contact analysis. Cuspal widening was measured for the different contact locations and restorative conditions (unaltered tooth, MOD porcelain, and composite-inlay restorations).
The design was a case-control study. The setting was the laboratory of postgraduate students in the College of Pharmacy, University of Mosul, Iraq. Clinical evaluation of the paste was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Oral Medicine Department, College of Dentistry, University of Baghdad, Iraq. The novel paste (named dexamucobase) was prepared under aseptic conditions and evaluated for its therapeutic effect in 53 patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis, in comparison with 37 patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide in Orabase.
Six commercially available ball attachment systems were selected. The balls were attached to stylized implants fixed in metal casts. The matrices were fixed in a stylized unilaterally removable partial denture (RPD). Using a chewing simulator with 8 units, 50,000 joining and separating cycles of the matrices were performed. After each joining movement, an eccentric load of 100 N was applied to the RPD at a distance of 12 mm from the ball attachment. The retention forces were measured at intervals.
Between December 2003 and December 2006, 22 patients (10 women and 12 men with a median age of 51 years) underwent grafting with horizontal augmentation without membrane and 88 implants inserted thereafter. The mean implant follow-up was 27 months. Implants used were 30 double etched (3i, Osseotite, Biomet), 10 SLA1 (Astratech), 26 anodic oxidized (Nobel Biocare), 12 CaPO4 ceramic-blasted (Lifecore Biomedical), 7 SLA2 (Sweden and Martina Spa), 2 ITI (Straumann), and 1 Biotec (Povolaro di Dueville). Implant diameter and length ranged from 3.25 to 5.0 mm and from 8.0 to 15.0 mm, respectively. Implants were inserted to replace 10 incisors, 7 canines, 36 premolars, and 35 molars.
Three examiners determined the L* (lightness), C* (chroma), and h* (hue) values and tooth color according to the Vita 3D-Master shade guide system (Vident), twice for 161 anterior teeth of 19 subjects by use of a spectrophotometer (Vita Easyshade 1, Vita Zahnfabrik). Between the 2 measurements on each tooth, the investigators had to completely remove the probe tip from the mouth. The reliability of the measurements was observed, and deviations between the 2 L*C*h* measurements, as well as DeltaEab for the measurements, were calculated.
We developed a protocol to generate DCs from hESCs in vitro in the absence of serum and feeder cells. This protocol uses growth factors bone morphogenetic protein-4, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor and VEGF in serum-free media to generate hESC-derived monocytic cells. These cells are further differentiated to hESC-derived immature DCs with GM-CSF and IL-4, and matured to hESC-derived mature DCs with a maturation cocktail consisting of GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and PGE2.
BM-MSCs were cultured in fibrin and assessed for cell attachment and viability by using immunofluorescence staining for actin filaments and Live/Dead((R)) viability assays, respectively. To determine the efficacy of BM-MSCs in fibrin in vivo, chronically infarcted rat hearts were treated with either cells, cells in fibrin, fibrin or saline (n = 9). After 5 weeks, the infarct scar tissues were assessed for neovascularization.
In this investigation, the impact of available oxygen was investigated to identify optimal conditions for human ASC chondrogenesis in vitro. Four physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations of 15, 10, 5 and 1% were compared with ambient air condition, and the ASCs originating from six unrelated donors were subjected to chondrogenic induction in high-density pellet cultures.
The analysis is based on 20 interviews with leading industrialists in the field.
We performed a literature review to generate a list of potentially important items for the assessment of control of ARA. A formal consensus development process, that used an innovative web-based application, was designed - 111 experts in ARA and 60 patients participated. At the final consensus meeting, 25 primary and secondary care physicians formulated the questions and response options. A qualitative feasibility study (n = 31 patients) was conducted to evaluate the comprehensibility of the questionnaire while testing two different designs.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cell numbers and intracellular granzyme B and perforin were analysed by flow cytometry. Immunomagnetically selected CD8+ T lymphocytes, NK (CD56+CD3-) and NKT-like (CD56+CD3+) cells were used in an LDH release assay to determine cytotoxicity and cytotoxic mechanisms were investigated by blocking perforin and granzyme B with relevant antibodies.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered to 159 stroke survivors and caregivers at discharge and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Other variables tested included stroke survivor function (FIM), health status, mutuality, stroke impact (SIS), caregiver coping (F-COPES), support (MOS Social Support Survey), and preparedness. Repeated measures analyses of PSS scores were conducted with linear mixed models for stroke survivors and caregivers.
Guided by a conceptual model, 6 outcomes (optimism, task difficulty, threat appraisal, depressive symptoms, life changes, general health perceptions) were measured in 40 caregivers randomized to the TASK (n=21) or an attention control group (n=19). Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for baseline scores and minutes spent with the nurse.
Caregivers were recruited in the Midwest and randomized into an experimental (Web users, n=36) or control (non-Web users, n=37) group. Telephone interviews were conducted with the caregivers every 2 weeks. Reported reasons were organized by group and time period in which the service occurred (i.e., Months 1-6 or 7-12; 1-year totals). Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze these data.
Adaptive physical activity sessions were conducted 3 times/week for 6 months. The main outcomes were Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, 6-Minute Walk Test, cardiovascular fitness (VO2 peak), Falls Efficacy Scale, and 5-day Step Activity Monitoring.
Participants were recruited primarily from six major metropolitan hospital databases. A total of 135 first-ever stroke survivors aged 25-96 years who were 6 to 24 months post stroke and community-dwelling were studied longitudinally over 6 months. HRQoL and psychosocial factors (optimism, self-esteem, perceived control, depressive status, and social support) were measured at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months.
ACT is a RCT of acetylcysteine versus placebo in 2,300 patients at-risk for CIN undergoing an intravascular angiographic procedure. The randomization list will be concealed. Participants, health care staff, investigators and outcome assessors will be blinded to whether patients receive acetylcysteine or placebo. All analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The study drugs (acetylcysteine 1200 mg or placebo) will be administered orally twice daily for two doses before and two doses after the procedure. The primary outcome is the occurrence of CIN, defined as a 25% elevation of serum creatinine above baseline between 48 and 96 hours after angiography.
We will conduct a systematic review of reports of RCTs recently published in five top general medical journals. Eligible RCTs will demonstrate statistically significant effect estimates with respect to primary outcomes that are patient-important and expressed as binary data. Teams of 2 reviewers will independently determine eligibility and extract relevant information from each eligible trial using standardized, pre-piloted forms. To assess the potential impact of loss to follow-up on the estimates of treatment effect we will, for varying assumptions about the outcomes of participants lost to follow-up (LTFU), calculate (1) the percentage of RCTs that lose statistical significance and (2) the mean change in effect estimate across RCTs. The different assumptions we will test are the following: (1) none of the LTFU participants had the event; (2) all LTFU participants had the event; (3) all LTFU participants in the treatment group had the event; none of those in the control group had it (worst case scenario); (4) the event incidence among LTFU participants (relative to observed participants) increased, with a higher relative increase in the intervention group; and (5) the event incidence among LTFU participants (relative to observed participants) increased in the intervention group and decreased in the control group.
The sample consisted of three groups comprising 36 Caucasian models, 30 Korean models, and 26 Korean nonmodels. Their frontal photos were scanned, and 12 distances, five angles, lip perimeter, and lip area were measured. Differences among groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test.
Mesiodistal positional, angular, and vertical changes of impacted canines were evaluated and statistically analyzed in pre- and posttreatment panoramic radiographs of 22 patients (12 treated with combination headgear, 10 treated with an activator).
The mesiodistal dimensions of teeth on study casts of 12- to 14-year-old Turkish children were measured. The actual tooth measurements were then compared with predicted values using the Tanaka-Johnston equation. Subsequently, the new regression equations were tested in a group of 50 individuals to determine their validity.
Seventy-five pretreatment lateral cephalograms (25 each of Class I, II, and III) were subdivided based on ANB, Wits appraisal, and Beta angle into skeletal Class I, II, and III. The same cephalograms were again classified into skeletal Class I, II, and III based purely on Beta angle. The new measurement is based on the landmarks S, M (midpoint of the anterior maxilla), and G (center at the bottom of the symphysis), which form the YEN angle measured at M.
Based on data obtained from previous oligonucleotide arrays, we investigated expression of VAT-1 in glioblastoma tissue and cell lines on mRNA levels using reverse transcriptase PCR. Furthermore, we examined the amount and localization of VAT-1 protein using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Using small interfering RNA technology we repressed VAT-1 expression in human glioma cell lines and analysed their migration using wound healing and transwell migration assays.
Biopsy spheroids were implanted and passaged intracranially in nude rats. Gene expression and protein analyses were performed, and drug sensitivity was assessed.
A cohort of 2598 patients of falciparum malaria were enrolled in this study of which 2089 patients were included as developmental sample and 509 patients as validation sample. Physiological variables were analyzed for defining and assessment of severity of organ dysfunction (OD). The severity level and corresponding severity score for each organ dysfunction were determined by logistic regression analysis that took both the relative severity among the organ systems and the degree of severity within an organ system into account. Risk of mortality has been calculated for each score.
We developed a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network model, which had been trained by back propagation algorithm. Data was used from a cohort of 241 individuals with diabetes. We used age, gender, weight, fasting plasma glucose as a set of inputs and predicted measures of well-being (depression, anxiety, energy and positive well-being).
Seventy seven patients of type 2 diabetes were recruited for the study (one patient lost after recruitment; 76 completed the study). History and physical examination were recorded. Laboratory investigations included fasting and 2-hour post-prandial blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, lipid profile, glycated haemoglobin, and microalbuminuria. Ultrasonographic scanning of the carotid arteries was performed to measure the carotid IMT. For identification of cases of silent ischaemia, treadmill test (TMT) was performed.
The Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study [CURES] is a large cross-sectional study conducted in Chennai, South India. In Phase 1 of CURES(urban component), 26,001 individuals aged &gt; or =20 years individuals were selected by a systematic sampling technique of whom one hundred subjects were randomly selected, using computer-generated numbers, for this validation study. Two self-reported questionnaires (modified PHQ-12 item and PHQ-9 item) were administered to the subjects to compare their effectiveness in detecting depression. Reliability and validity were assessed and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. Pearson's correlation was used to compare the two questionnaires.
The methods applied include a literature search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting the studies, characteristics of the studies, quality assessment and meta-analysis. Data sources included PubMed, EMBASE, SciELO and LILACS. Selected papers were articles relating to human studies investigating whether or not diabetes is a risk factor for periodontitis and if it influences the response to periodontal therapy. Those papers that were published between January 1980 and June 2007 were retrieved.
A cross-sectional study of 94 dentate patients aged 60 or older was conducted at two public dental offices in Lithuania. Half-mouth recordings of dental plaque, calculus and deepened periodontal pockets were expressed as mean values per subject. These indicators described the severity of periodontal findings. A self-administered questionnaire provided information on toothbrushing frequency, age, gender and education. Statistical evaluation included chi-square test, analysis of variance and logistic regression.
This was a double-blind, linear crossover, within-group comparative experimental trial conducted among 40 children aged 12 to 15 years. The study was divided into five phases: (1) distilled water (control); (2) 3% neem; (3) 2% triclosan; (4) 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate; and (5) 1% sodium hypochlorite. The toothbrushes were collected after 5 days of brushing and were soaked for 12 h in antimicrobial solutions of separate phases, after which the toothbrushes were submitted for microbial analysis to check for the presence of S. mutans.
Forty patients participated in a randomised study. Of the 60 root carious lesions that were included, 20 were randomised for treatment with the Carisolv chemo-mechanical technique and the Duraphat (2.23% F) fluoride varnish, 20 with Duraphat alone and 20 with stannous fluoride solution (8%). The lesions were treated at baseline and after three and six months; a clinical evaluation was carried out on these occasions and after 1 year.
The present study sample consisted of 178 first-year medical students. The questionnaire that was used in this study included information about sociodemographic factors, behavioural factors, self-reported oral health status, self-control and self-confidence.
A cross-sectional study was performed involving individuals over the age of 59 years, resident in the city of Florian√≥polis, Brazil. A sample of 180 individuals selected in a two-stage approach was examined and interviewed. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) was used to collect data on self-reported quality of life. The OIDP questionnaire was used to collect data on oral impact on daily performances. The criteria for the clinical data were those proposed by the World Health Organization. The dependent variable was the oral impact on daily performances. The chi-square test was used to examine the association between the dependent and the exploratory variables. Variables were inserted in a model of multiple logistic regression. The level of significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.
Self-administered questionnaires for Finnish (n = 338) and Turkish (n = 611) pre-adolescents and their mothers were used to collect the information on cognitive (pre-adolescent and maternal self-efficacy) and behavioural factors (toothbrushing frequencies).
A random sample of 130 subjects, aged 21 to 63 years, was selected from the non-academic staff members of the Athens University of Economics and Business. Data were obtained for 92% (120 participants) of the sample by a questionnaire-based interview and a clinical examination. The questions concentrated on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the ratings of oral health, the perceived need, oral functional impacts and the level of satisfaction with the appearance. In the clinical examination, the oral health status of the participants was thoroughly recorded.
The study sample consisted of 217 first-year dental students. The questionnaire included information about sociodemographic factors, behavioural variables, self-reported oral health status, self-liking, self-competence, body investment and perfectionism.
Retrospective, observational study in a single centre, university-affiliated hospital included 319 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and suitable for TOE. TOE was performed in each patient before and after the institution of cardiopulmonary by-pass. Normal and abnormal echocardiographic findings as well as immediate outcomes of the surgical procedure were recorded using a standard database form. Instances where TOE lead to alteration in operative management were documented. The findings were also compared with those documented on preoperative echocardiography.
We prospectively evaluated the levels of the serum concentration of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBil), in 42 morbidly obese and 40 non obese patients who were scheduled for elective abdominal surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia at the Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan. Measurement of liver enzymes was done in the recovery room, and on the first, 3 and 7 days after sevoflurane anesthesia, and the results were compared between the morbidly obese and non obese patients.
With the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, all patients were surveyed for quality of analgesia and complications. The patients and their caretaker received verbal and written instructions, including care of the catheter and pump, and a list of complications and side effects. All were instructed on catheter removal and were given a contact number, and patients were called once per day.
48 patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups following receiving spinal isobaric bupivacaine 12.5 mg. Patients in group D received intravenously a loading dose of 1 microg/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 min and a maintenance dose of 0.5 microg/kg/hr. Patients in group C (the control group) received normal saline. The regression times to reach S1 sensory level and Bromage 0 motor scale, hemodynamic changes and the level of sedation were recorded.
Seventy-five ASA I-II patients of both sexes (37 males (49.3%), 38 females (50.7%)) 18 to 45 years (mean 32.8 +/- 8.65 yr.) were randomly allocated into three equal groups (25 each). Group-1 received 0.2 mg clonidine, Group-2 received placebo and Group-3 received 900 mg gabapentin, 120 minute before operation. Heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure were measured before induction of anesthesia, before laryngoscopy, and 1, 3, 5, 10 min after intubation.
Eighty four pediatric patients suffering of cancer pain were studied during the period 2001-2006. Patients were requested to rate their global intensity of pain on 0-100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS 0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). Pain management was performed in accordance with the WHO Analgesic Ladder for cancer pain. Patients were followed up weekly for three weeks.
104 children, 7 to 15 yr, ASA I or II scheduled for elective adenotonsillectomy were recruited for the study. Patients were randomized to receive either rectal acetaminophen 40 mg/kg or nothing after induction of standard anesthesia. The postoperative pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) every 2 hours for the first 6 hours. The need for rescue analgesic, intravenous pethedine of 0.5 mg/kg, was recorded at 24 hours after surgery.
We compared the responses to a mechanical and an electrical stimulus in 30 pregnant women (pregnant group) scheduled for cesarean section and 30 healthy female volunteers (control group) matched for age. Pain was assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on two different days after skin application of EMLA or placebo cream on the forearms. EMLA and placebo cream were randomly applied on the medial surface of both forearms for 30 min in a blind cross over manner and the subjects received a mechanical stimulus generated through a pressor palpator followed by an electrical stimulus generated through a nerve stimulator.
15 patients scheduled for robotic laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RLRC) were randomly allocated into two groups to be anesthetized by either isoflurane anesthesia (ISO n = 8) or ketamine-midazolam-fentanyl total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA n = 7). The hemo-respiratory dynamics, oxygenation and biochemical variables were monitored taking into consideration the system organ function as primary outcomes, and operative conditions and recovery profile as secondary outcomes.
Forty-six patients (20-50 yrs), were randomly allocated in two equal groups. Under identical condition, the control group received a total dose of 3 mg/kg of lidocaine 1% diluted with saline, and the study group received an additional 200 microg NTG. Vital signs and tourniquet pain, based on visual analog scale (VAS) score were measured and recorded before and 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after anesthetic solution administration. The onset times of sensory and motor block were measured and recorded in all patients. After the tourniquet deflation, at 30 min and 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h, VAS score, time to first analgesic requirement, total analgesic consumption in the first 24 h after operation, and side effects were noted.
A crossover randomized study of IVRA with a forearm tourniquet was conducted on 14 male healthy volunteers. This study was performed, once using manual injection of local anesthetic and once using automatic pump injection, on two separate sessions. In both techniques, 0.3 ml/kg lidocaine 0.5% was injected over 90 seconds. The occlusion pressure, continuous venous pressure and the serum lidocaine two minutes at end of injection, were recorded.
Thirty full-term infants scheduled for pyloromyotomy were prospectively studied. A standardized anesthetic induction was performed. For maintenance of anesthesia, infants were randomly allocated to receive either isoflurane 0.75% of inspired concentration (GI n = 15), or remifentanil as a continuous infusion of 0.4 microg x kg(-1) x mn(-1) (GR n = 15). At the beginning of skin closure, the anesthetic was discontinued and 15 mg x kg(-1) of paracetamol administered. Non parametric tests were used in statistical analysis.
Descriptive study comparing weight loss over time in intervention and control groups. Of 217 eligible participants in the intervention group, 58% were Native Hawaiian.
The study was conducted as a prospective comparative clinical trial. The patients (n=90) were classified according to the applied anesthetic technique into two groups: Volatile Induction and Maintenance Anaesthesia (VIMA) with sevofluran and Target Controlled Infusion (TCI). The results relating to parameters of recovery after anesthesia and surgery were compared between these two groups. The following parameters were analysed: demographic patients' characteristics, duration of anesthesia, the times to eye opening, to respond to a command, to extubation, and to orientation, from the last anesthetic dose receiving until post anesthesia discharge (PAD), frequency of postoperative nausea, vomiting and agitation (PONVA).
We presented here a four-year experience with 84 patients with breast reconstruction after modified radical mastectomy.
The study was conduced on 163 OLP patients who came in the Department of Oral medicine and Periodontology between 1997 and September 2007. Each case was classified into one of four clinical subtypes: reticular, atrophic, erosive-ulcerative, bullous.
This retrospective study analysed 40 patients who had been operated for OSCC of their tongue and the mouth floor. Of these patients, some had stage II and III OSCC with histological grade, G1-G3 and nuclear grade Ng1-Ng3. Two high quality tissue samples were obtained and immunohistochemical expression of VEGF was quantitatively determined by using high microscope amplification. The value of VEGF expression of 20% was rated as significant expression, whereas tumor cells reactivation less than 20% was considered very low or no expression at all. The patients were followed up for a 3-year period.
The study included 30 patients of both sexes (25 males and 5 females), mean age 30.10 +/- 10.24 years. The patients were classified in accordance with CEAP (clinical severity, ethiology or cause, anatomy, pathophysiology) classification as those with the initial varicous syndrome based on IPV. Any of the patients were submitted to color Doppler echophlebography. In case of diameter &gt; or = 3.5 mm PV were marked as IPV. All of the IPV were divided into two groups, the group I being with ostium in the stem of Vena Saphena Magna (VSM) or Vena Saphena Parva (VSP), while the group II was with ostium in the venous tributors. VSM and VSP diameters at the level of IPV ostium, bellow and above (1 cm) the ostium were measured prior to IPV ligature, and 30 days after the surgical intervention.
The study was carried out during 2007-2008 at the School of Medicine, University of Nis. It included 824 students in their final year (220 males, 604 females).
To evaluate oxidative stress in the patients, we determinated following parameters: triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), oxidized LDL cholesterol (Ox LDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) which were measured at rest and immediately after the acute bout of cardiopulmonary exercise cycle-ergometer test.
We studied 161 military pilots (age 38 +/- 6 years) free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Traditional and metabolic risk factors were determined. Plasma CRP was measured by immunonephelometry. The common carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasonography in the posterior wall of both common carotid arteries.
In data analysis, crude rates age and sex specific rates, and standardized incidence rates were used. Standardization was performed by a direct method, using world population as the standard.
We presented two cases. A case one, a 35-year-old, previously healthy, woman ingested 14% diquat solution. The poisoning had fulminant course, consisted of severe stomachache, vomiting, cardiocirculatory shock, respiratory failure and cardiac arrest 20 hours post-ingestion. Autopsy revealed myocardial infarction, bronchopneumonia and incipient renal damage. A case two, a 64-year-old man developed severe gastroenteritis, corrosive lesions of mucosal surfaces, acute renal injury, arrhythmias, brain stem infarction and bronchopneumonia. The diagnosis of diquat poisoning was made retrospectively upon the clinical picture and identification of pesticides he had been exposed to. The patient died 18 days post-exposure. The most prominent findings on autopsy were pontine hemorrhage and infarction, bronchopneumonia, left ventricle papillary muscle infarction and renal tubular damage.
The study included four patients who presented with amyloidosis-associated intrahepatic cholestasis. Three of them had renal amyloidosis which developed 1-3 years before cholestasis occurred, the remaining one having intrahepatic cholestasis as the primary sign of the disease. Amyloidosis was identified from liver biopsies in all patients by its specific binding to Congo red and green birefringence in polarized light. The biochemical nature and the class of amyloid deposits were identified immunohistochemically. In addition to their regular treatment, the patients received 750 mg ursodeoxycholic acid per day. After 2-4 weeks all patients had a significant decrease of serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and their general status significantly improved.
A female patient, aged 38 years, visited doctor complaing of a decreased vision acuity and severe pain in the left eye and in the left part of the head. The initial treatment was urgent antiglaucomatous therapy followed by withdrawal of subjective problems of the patient and improvement of objective finding. History taking procedure revaled that just before the onset of the pain the patient had used ecstasy and had had similar "experience" 6 years ago after cocaine snorting. She had not been to a doctor although she had experienced sporadic migrenous pain. Previous medical records excavation of revealed optic disk (cup-to-dise C/D=06), Bjerum arcuate scotoma and iris plateau with narrow chamber angle (Scheie II-III) so the diagnosis was a rare unilateral iris plateau syndrome of the left eye. Although the patient was given some pieces of information about the dangerous and possible deadly consequences of psychoactive substanace abuse, she has not continue the treatment.
CINAHL, Medline, and the Cochrane database of Systematic Reviews were searched from 1987 to 2008. Information was also obtained through government health and professional organisation websites. All information in the literature regarding current and past status, and nomenclature of advanced practice nursing was considered relevant.
A self-administered online survey was completed by 68 NPs from across Australia.
This is an ethnographic study involving two AHCSs as participants. Audio visual data was collected in 2007 at a Major Metropolitan Hospital, Sydney during after hours shifts. The data was coded using the standards defined in the Nurse Practitioner (NP) competencies.
American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status IYII patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty were administered effective single-shot blocks of the obturator and sciatic nerves using ropivacaine 0.5% 10 and 20 mL, respectively. Continuous femoral blocks were performed using stimulating catheters, which were advanced blindly. Neurostimulation via catheter was performed but was masked from the investigators' sight. Before general anesthesia was induced for surgery, 5 mL of ropivacaine 0.2% was administered through the femoral nerve catheter, followed by infusion (5 mL/hr). Visual analog scale (VAS) score at rest was recorded on admission to the postanesthesia care unit. Characteristics of neurostimulation via the catheters were analyzed.
Data were collected in a population-based case-control study, conducted in Montreal in the mid-1980s, designed to assess the associations between hundreds of non-occupational and occupational exposures and multiple cancer sites in men. We present results for 13 cancer sites: oesophagus (n = 78), stomach (n = 215), colon (n = 427), rectum (n = 239), liver (n = 28), pancreas (n = 83), lung (n = 700), melanoma (n = 107), prostate (n = 374), bladder (n = 425), kidney (n = 156), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 42), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 190), in comparison to population controls (n = 507). Odds ratios (OR) were estimated for the associations between lifetime consumption of total alcoholic beverages, beer, wine, and/or spirits, altogether and separately, and each cancer site, while carefully adjusting for smoking and other covariates using polytomous logistic regression.
Patients underwent unilateral sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa with mepivacaine 1.5%, using either a stimulating (STIM group) or a nonstimulating (NONSTIM group) popliteal catheter. The volume of mepivacaine started at 20 mL and was increased or decreased by increments of 2 mL in subsequent patients, depending on the efficacy of the block in the previous patient, using the technique of up-down sequential allocation described by Dixon (Neurosci Biobehav Rev. 1991;15:47-50). Minimum effective volumes of local anesthetic were calculated using the formula of Dixon. Efficacy of block was defined by a complete sensory-motor block in the cutaneous distributions of the sciatic nerve associated with a pain-free surgery.
ME cases were identified by surname in the California cancer registry and ME population estimates were based on ancestry. Data for 683 cases of primary brain tumors (429 benign, 238 malignant, 16 uncertain) in the ME and 15,589 cases (8352 benign, 6812 malignant, 425 uncertain) in the NHNMW were available for this study.
A total of 160 cases and 140 control subjects were studied for the polymorphisms at 3' end of the VDR gene. A polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and fragment analysis was performed to determine ApaI and TaqI polymorphisms and variable length poly-A microsatellite repeats. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated for each pair of polymorphisms. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for breast cancer with genotypes comprising the polymorphic sites were calculated to understand their role towards breast cancer susceptibility.
After obtaining the approval of the hospital ethics committee and written informed consent, 12 healthy volunteers (age, 34 years [SD, 10 years]; height, 169 cm [SD, 9 cm]; weight, 65 kg [SD, 10 kg]) were studied with MRI, and their positions were changed as follows: the supine position, lateral decubitus position without fully flexed legs, and lateral decubitus position with fully flexed legs. The movement of the central point of the spinal cord and cauda equina by changing position was evaluated.
In this work, we have conducted a case-control study in order to assess the combined effect of tobacco, slow NAT2 variants, MTHFR 677*T and MTR 2756*G alleles on bladder cancer development in North Tunisia.
We created a model using nerve, muscle, bone, and tendon tissue dissected from a sheep. Regional anesthesia needles of 21-gauge and 100 mm were placed into each of these tissues under direct vision, and 40 anesthetists were then asked to inject normal saline from a 20-mL syringe. They were unable to see the needle position. Once injected into all 4 tissues, they were asked to state which tissue they thought each was.
Sprague-Dawley rats of the same ages were randomly assigned into three groups treated differently. Rats in group one were given green tea in drinking water (tea concentration: 1.2%; tea polyphenols in the tea solution: 0.3%); rats in the groups two and three were given blank drinking water. Rats in the groups one and two were injected intra-pulmonarily with 3,4-benzopyrene dissolved in corn oil (2 mg/0.2 mL/injection, fortnightly, 4 times in all); rats in the group three were injected with the vehicle corn oil as the control for injection. All the rats were sacrificed one year after the first intra-pulmonary injection. Tumors developed in rats and lung tissues were collected for carcinoma diagnosis and for p53 and bcl-2 expression.
The guardians of 119 children provided demographic data and completed the standardized Arabic version of the ADHD Rating Scale on their children, who were either normal, had a diagnosis of ADHD, or had a non-ADHD psychiatric diagnosis. The mean rating scores of the groups were compared, and the cutoff points were calculated for both sexes.
One hundred ninety-six male football players (mean age [SD], 13.5 [0.5] yrs), practicing in three different cities of Tunisia (Tunis, Sousse and Sfax), underwent an outdoor free run of 7 minutes. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV subset1) was recorded prior to and at 0, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes after the run. Players were screened for EIB positivity defined as a greater than 10% decline in FEV subset1 from the resting value at any timepoint.
We identified each case of male breast cancer in the database at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Kashmir, India, between the years 1983 to 2007.
The study was conducted on a convenience sample consisting of consecutive adult Arabic-speaking outpatients or visitors attending a university teaching hospital. Subjects were interviewed twice using a standardized questionnaire containing the EQ-5D, Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). To assess the validity of the Arabic version of the EQ-5D, ten hypotheses relating responses to EQ-5D dimensions or the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) to SF-36 scores or other variables were examined and test-retest reliability was assessed.
Six hundred thirteen married females were studied between October 2006 and August 2007 at the National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics (NCDEG), Amman, Jordan. Females were interviewed using a special questionnaire that was suitable to our culture and added to the Arabic translation of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Questionnaire.
The lesion morphology and contrast kinetics of 63 masses in 41 patients were evaluated on MRI and accorded a MRM BI-RADS final assessment category using the Fischer scoring system. The accuracy was evaluated after the final diagnosis was obtained by tissue sampling and follow-up imaging.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted on the anthropometric status of school children enrolled in the primary, intermediate and secondary government schools in all populated regions of Bahrain. The sample size included 2594 students (1326 girls and 1268 boys) representing 2.5% of the total student population. For sample selection, a multi-stage sampling design was chosen that combined multi-cluster and simple random sampling methods. Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, mid-arm circumference and skin fold thickness at two sites (triceps and subscapular). Anthropometric indices derived were body mass index (BMI) and arm muscle area. The WHO reference standards (2007) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II data were used for comparison.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 secondary schools for girls using the Arabic version of the symptom-revised checklist 90 (SCL 90-R), a mental health questionnaire that was administered to the girls by fourth-year female medical students.
We report a case of widely metastatic malignant melanoma with diagnostic difficulties in both clinical and histopathological evaluation. Thorax CT, Abdominal MRI, tumor marker screening and two biopsies were performed to conclude the primary.

The study comprised a retrospective audit of data from 200 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were admitted to hospital for a relapse of their disorder in two mental health services in Australia between 1 June 2001 and 31 May 2002. Resource use and costing data were collected for 12 months before and 12 months after the hospitalization.
A purposive convenience sample of 10 service users under CTOs were interviewed using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T). Ratings were compared with the ratings of 10 matched voluntary service users.
This study employed a prospective cohort design in the form of a clinical audit. Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) pre- and post-admission scores were compared for the whole sample and across diagnoses.
A semi-structured qualitative interview was undertaken with nine children aged 7-12 years. Transcribed interviews were analyzed to reveal common themes.
An audit of patients with schizophrenia, discharged from three psychiatric wards, was conducted. Two data sheets were recorded for every patient and inter-rater reliability was calculated. Data were then entered into SPSS and statistical significance calculated.
We measured the number of alprazolam prescriptions for the years prior to and the year following the intervention. Health Insurance Commission data were utilized to enable comparison of subsidized prescription rates for alprazolam in Tasmania, and compared with national data. Participants were registered medical practitioners in Tasmania who were potential prescribers of alprazolam. The interventions were three GP Education Meetings during June 2007, one in each of the major regions of Tasmania, regarding evidence-based interventions for panic disorder. Changes to regulatory procedures to minimize co-prescription of alprazolam with opioids was implemented in September 2007.
Medical students enrolled in the University of Sydney in 2008 were invited to complete a voluntary online questionnaire, in which their attitudes towards psychiatry were explored, and the immediate effects of a 15-minute DVD were ascertained.
From 44 MAP patients who developed &gt; or = 1 CRCs, 42 of 58 tumours were analyzed histologically and 35 immunohistochemically for p53 and beta-catenin. Cell densities of CD3, CD8, CD57, and granzyme B positive lymphocytes were determined. KRAS2, the mutation cluster region (MCR) of APC, p53, and SMAD4 were analyzed for somatic mutations.
Data are drawn from a longitudinal, 6 months observational, pragmatic study of the effects and experience of shiatsu within three European countries (Austria, Spain and the UK). Client postal questionnaires included: advice received, changes made 6 months later, clients 'hopes' from having shiatsu and features of the client-practitioner relationship.
156 non-demented participants in the brain donation programme of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS) were included in this study. Neuropathological examination was based on the CERAD protocol; pathologies of interest were amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, vascular disease and neuronal loss. Self-reported functional ability was scored according to a combined activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living scale.
Data were obtained from the records of 3,217 patients randomly sampled from 5,649 patients with COPD in 38 general practices in Rotherham, UK. Severity of airflow obstruction was categorised by FEV1 (% predicted) according to NICE guidelines. This was compared with clinician recorded COPD severity. The proportion of patients whose spirometry met BTS standards was calculated in each practice using a random sub-sample of 761 patients. The Spearman rank correlation between practice level QOF spirometry achievement and performance against BTS spirometry standards was calculated.
Study Tool: We developed a semi-structured interview guide to elicit the knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives of Egyptians regarding medical research.
We recruited individuals from the outpatient settings (public and private) at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt.
Interviews were taped, transcribed, and translated. We analyzed the content of the transcribed text to identify the presence of a TM, defined in one of two ways: TM1 = inaccurate beliefs about how individualized care can be compromised by the procedures in the research and TM2 = inaccurate appraisal of benefit obtained from the research study.
97 human DNA samples were obtained which included 24 patients with familial PAH, 18 obligate carriers (BMPR2 mutation positive), 20 sporadic PAH patients, and 35 controls. Two sets of primers were designed within the CNV, and two sets of control primers were designed outside the CNV. Quantitative PCR was performed to quantify genomic copies of CNV and control sequences.
To test this hypothesis we set out to investigate whether mtDNA genetic variants will be differentially associated with T2DM depending on the diabetes status of the parents. To this end, association of mtDNA genetic backgrounds (haplogroups) with T2DM was assessed in 1055 Jewish patients with and without T2DM parents ('DP' and 'HP', respectively).
Female Wistar rats were OVX- or sham-operated at 40 weeks of age. Twelve weeks post-surgery, rats were randomized into seven groups: 1) sham + vehicle, 2) OVX + vehicle, 3) OVX + ALF 0.025 microg/kg/day, 4) OVX + ALF 0.05 microg, 5) OVX + RIS 0.3 mg, 6) OVX + RIS 3.0 mg, 7) OVX + ALF 0.025 microg + RIS 0.3 mg. Each drug was administered orally five times a week for 12 weeks. After treatment, we evaluated the mechanical properties of the lumbar vertebra and femoral midshaft. In the lumbar vertebra, structural and material analyses were performed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and microbeam X-ray diffraction (micro-XRD), respectively. Biochemical markers in serum and urine were also determined.
In a qualitative study design, focus groups were established consisting of general practitioners, geriatricians, palliative care physicians, palliative care nurses and general nurses (a total of 29 participants). The group discussions were recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using the methodological approach of Qualitative Description.
Using data from a large and ongoing Demographic Surveillance System, 41,517 adults, enumerated in bi-annual rounds between 2001 and 2005, and aged 18 to 60 years were categorized into four groups: external in-migrants, internal migrants, out-migrants and residents. The risk of dying by migration status was quantified by Cox proportional hazard regression. In a sub-group analysis of 1212 deaths which occurred in 2000 - 2001 and for which cause of death information was available, the relationship between migration status and dying from AIDS was examined in logistic regression.
A longitudinal, non-controlled design was used. The programme consisted of two weekly exercise sessions and one weekly cognitive session during 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were body mass index, blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, abdominal muscle strength, and low back and hamstring flexibility. Potential determinants of change in physical health were demographic variables, psychological variables (self-esteem, mastery, and kinesiophobia), and self-perceived health.
In a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, we are evaluating the effectiveness of CBT/relaxation, of physical exercise and of these two program elements combined, in reducing menopausal symptoms, improving sexual functioning, reducing emotional distress, and in improving the health-related quality of life of younger breast cancer patients who experience treatment-induced menopause. 325 breast cancer patients (aged &lt; 50) are being recruited from hospitals in the Amsterdam region, and randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups or a 'waiting list' control group. Self-administered questionnaires are completed by the patients at baseline, and at 12 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2) post-study entry. Upon completion of the study, women assigned to the control group will be given the choice of undergoing either the CBT or physical exercise program.

Charts of 31 consecutive patients who underwent surgery in the pst 5 years for restrictive strabismus secondary to thyroid ophthalmopathy were retrospectively reviewed. All surgery was performed by recession and reattachment of the muscle to the globe, allowing for no postoperative adjustment. Standard doses were used for all primary surgery and slightly modified in some cases of reoperation, but the general principal was from a standard published nomogram.
Thisis a report of a patient who underwent re-shaping and attachment of Tenon's capsule to the original insertion of the medial rectus muscle that ruptured during attempted medial rectus recession for longstanding esotropia with medial rectus restriction. The procedure was done immediately following the loss and failure to retrieve the lost muscle.
Case report.
A 4 year old boy underwent a successful left superior oblique tuck for a left superior oblique palsy. Eleven months after surgery, the non-absorbable suture used forf the tuck extruded coincidentally with ocular trauma. The suture was slightly adherent to a suture granuloma in the supranasal quadrant of the left eye and removed without loss of surgical effect of the superior oblique tuck.
One thousand one hundred and twenty four primary school pupils participated, and results for key stage 3 (KS3) English and GCSE English Language, for 3,493 Year 10 and 3,697 Year 12 secondary school pupils, respectively, were obtained.
Primary school pupils were individually assessed using standardised reading and spelling tests, as well as tests of motor skill. They were also assessed using a standardised group reading test in their class groups. For the secondary school pupils, the results for two year cohorts, in KS3 English and GCSE English language, respectively, were analysed.
Eight schools were selected as willing to test their Y9 or Y8 classes on either the Pendulum (in 2007) or the Equilibrium in the Balance tests (in 2006), giving 39 classes on which to make the comparison with 1976 performance.
Regression of the pupils' class mean on each formal test on either the class's 2004 MidYIS or nferCAT standardized scores, and computing the regression at IQ = 100 allows comparison with that found in 1976.
Three groups (i.e. first-year, second-year, and third-year students) in two different curricula (i.e. conventional, lecture-based and constructivist, problem-based) were tested.
A cross-sectional design was used. Students' conceptions of constructivist activities (i.e. knowledge construction, cooperative learning, self-regulation, use of authentic problems, self-perceived inability to learn, and motivation to learn) were measured by a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using a two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).
Four hundred and ten undergraduate students (263 males, 147 females), aged from 17 to 26 years old (M=19.73, SD=1.46) were volunteers for the present study.
Students completed measures of coping, implicit theories of academic ability, and perception of control over academic examinations during regular classes in the first term of the university year.
The sample for this study was 63 teacher education students who studied in groups of three to five during three collaborative learning tasks.
Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions.
Four hundred and eighty-two students in the eighth grade of secondary education.
Two curriculum units for dialogic citizenship education were developed and implemented. The two curriculum units differed in the balance between group work and whole-class teaching. Students' ability to justify an opinion was assessed by means of short essays written by students on a moral issue. The effectiveness of both curriculum units was compared with regular history classes.
The sample consisted of 564 students (15-18 years of age) in vocational and general educational courses from one upper secondary school in western Norway.
The study was conducted as a survey. All data were based on adolescent reports, except for absence data, which were provided by the school.
In two classroom experiments, sixth-grade students from two schools participated (N=77 and 26).
Students completed six decimal lessons on an intelligent-tutoring systems. In the iterative condition, lessons cycled between concept and procedure lessons. In the concepts-first condition, all concept lessons were presented before introducing the procedure lessons.

Participants were 2,213 postgraduate research students of a large, research-intensive Australian university.
128 patients operated on by a single surgeon from July 2006 to December 2008 were reviewed for complications, pain, and function. A group of single incision, minimally invasive standard total hip replacements (106 cases) in 2008 was used for comparison of the same outcomes.
The specific question asked was whether resurfacing patients had differences in postoperative activity level, clinical outcomes, or rate of revisions, as compared to a matched cohort of patients treated with conventional THA. Thirty-three patients (23 men and 10 women) who were treated with resurfacing arthroplasties were matched to a cohort of patients who underwent conventional hip arthroplasty by gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and preoperative activity level. Mean preoperative Harris hip scores and length of follow-up were similar for the two groups. Postoperative weighted activity scores, Harris hip scores, patient satisfaction score, pain scores, and revision rates were evaluated at a mean final follow-up of 42 months (range, 25 to 68 months) for the resurfacing group and 45 months (range, 24 to 67 months) for the conventional hip group, and analyzed for differences.
A comprehensive review was performed of the published literature that directly compared total hip arthroplasty and resurfacing hip arthroplasty and that considered basic science, radiographic, and clinical studies.
Fifteen resurfacing femoral components were sectioned and the slices were radiographed and photographed, and the amount and distribution of cement were examined and measured. Cases representative of the evolving cementing techniques were examined in detail.
Sixty-nine consecutive hips in 57 patients with a minimum of 2 years clinical and radiographic follow-up were evaluated. Both acetabular and femoral component positions and postsurgical changes in the femoral neck and acetabulum were recorded.
At the Honolulu Heart Program's fourth examination in 1991 to 1993, arthritis status was assessed among a cohort of 3741 Japanese-American males, ages 71 to 93 years. Arthritis was determined by self-report of physician diagnosis, and subjects were divided into two groups: current arthritis and no current arthritis. Eight years of follow-up data are available for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in 2777 subjects free of CHD at baseline. Age-adjusted rates of incident CHD and means of cardiovascular risk factors were compared in each group. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate relative risks, adjusting for common cardiovascular risk factors, alcohol, and use of aspirin or NSAIDs, or both.
A single-centre retrospective review identified 53 patients (5.1 to 17.5 years of age) with structurally normal hearts who had undergone 65 graded treadmill exercise tests in the setting of either documented SVT with normal resting electrocardiograms (n=30) or ventricular preexcitation (n=23). Twenty-five patients (13 pre-excited and 12 nonpreexcited) had exercise-related symptoms. SVT induction during exercise testing was assessed in relation to pre-excitation and the patient's history of exercise-induced symptoms.
Forty-two patients with the metabolic syndrome and 40 age matched control subjects without the metabolic syndrome were included in the study. All subjects had normal coronary arteries. Diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome was based on the International Diabetes Federation guidelines published in 2005. Ascending AP was estimated as the ratio of aortic PP to mean blood pressure.
Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to quantitate the messenger RNA and protein of alpha(1)-AR and ATR subtypes, respectively, in the left ventricles of three- (young adult), 12- (middle age), 18- (presenescent) and 24-month-old (senescent) Wistar rats.
PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Medscape searches of all available English language articles from 1983 to 2006 were performed. Search terms included 'amiodarone -induced thyrotoxicosis', 'complications', 'management', 'treatment' and 'colour flow Dopper sonography'.
A 45-year-old man with an occluded left anterior descending artery and a moderately stenotic circumflex artery underwent simultaneous integrated coronary revascularization. Bivalirudin was used to achieve anticoagulation for the duration of the procedure. The patient was asymptomatic with excellent patency of both the bypass graft and the stented circumflex artery via angiography at 10 months.
Patients underwent treadmill exercise or dobutamine PET MPI. Images were assessed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. PET results were categorized as normal (summed stress score [SSS] of less than 4), abnormal (SSS of 4 or greater) or inconclusive (SSS of less than 4 and submaximal peak stress heart rate). Patient follow-up (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] and/or late revascularization) was performed.
The study population consisted of 1407 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization between 1992 and 1996. The median follow-up period was 9.7 years (interquartile range 6.1 to 11.1 years) and the mortality status as of December 31, 2004 was available for all patients.
Multiple imputation was applied to cardiac MRI data that were previously analyzed using a complete case approach. The model variables - 10 traditional cardiovascular risk factors and five sociodemographic variables - were used as a basis for imputation. Men and women were imputed separately. The primary focus was assessing the change in the cardiovascular predictors of left ventricular geometry and systolic function.
A total of 264 men and women, with CRP levels of 2 mg/L or greater and no history of cardiovascular disease, were enrolled in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg/day of ramipril (n=132) or placebo (n=132) for 12 weeks. The main outcome measure was the change in CRP levels from baseline to 12 weeks in the ramipril- versus placebo treated patients.
Celacade treatment was administered 14 days before coronary artery ligation and monthly after the surgery. Cytokine expression in cardiac tissue was measured on days 1 and 7 by ELISA in sham rats and in rats with MI (with or without Celacade treatment). Echocardiograms were obtained serially for 16 weeks. Force and sarcomere length (SL) were measured by strain gauge and laser diffraction in isolated right ventricle trabeculas at 16 weeks. The inotropic effect of pacing on force was quantified as F5 Hz/0.5 Hz. Diastolic dysfunction was quantified as the root mean square of spontaneous SL fluctuations.
Hearts from CVB3-infected (n=14), sham-infected (n=14) and CVB3-infected BALB/c mice treated with IL-15 (n=6) or a competitive IL-15 fusion protein (n=6) were analyzed for hemodynamic function, cellular infiltrates and myocardial collagen content.
Eight hospitals in different regions of Saudi Arabia were involved in the pilot phase of the registry, from December 2005 to July 2006. The study patients included individuals with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI and unstable angina.
Ten patients with CMI and syringomyelia, operated between 2004 and 2006, formed this prospective series. All cases underwent foramen magnum decompression of 3 x 3 cm area with C1-C2 (partial) laminectomy, resection of foramen magnum fibrous band, excision of external dura, delamination and widening of internal dura with longitudinal incisions.
Using death records from the National Center for Health Statistics, we calculated monthly mortality rates for persons with PF and developed a multivariable model to determine if these mortality rates exhibited seasonal variation.
We conducted a 6-month randomized, double-blind study in patients undergoing thoracotomy for minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass or for lung tumor resection. After extubation, when objectively awake (&gt;or= 5/10 visual analogue scale [VAS]) and complaining of pain (&gt;or= 5/10 VAS), patients were connected to patient-controlled IV analgesia delivering 1.5 mg of morphine plus saline solution (MO) or 1.0 mg of morphine plus a 5-mg ketamine bolus (MK), with a 7-min lockout time. Rescue IM diclofenac, 75 mg, was available. Follow-up lasted 4 h.
A prospective, randomized trial.
Two hundred two patients with PPLs and positive EBUS findings were enrolled. They were randomly classified into two groups. In the EBUS conventional diagnostic procedures (CDPs) group (103 patients), both transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and bronchial washing (BW) were performed. In the EBUS-TBNA plus CDPs group (99 patients), TBNA, TBB, and BW were performed. The diagnostic yield in each group was compared.
We evaluated 122 consecutive patients referred for diagnosis and treatment of PH and compared the prevalence of features of the MS between patients with PVH and those with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We also compared clinical and hemodynamic characteristics between these two groups.
Nineteen asthmatic nonsmokers (ANSs) and 13 asthmatic smokers (ASMs) underwent BAL. AMs were cultured with or without dexamethasone, 0.1 to 1,000 nmol/L, for 2 h before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [1 microg/mL] stimulation. After 6 h, supernatants were harvested for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and messenger RNA was collected for real-time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
In this pilot study, we examined a panel of circulating inflammatory biomarkers associated with CVD in "at-risk" women during the smoking cessation program. Forty-six women enrolled in a smoking cessation program consented to attend four study visits over 6 to 7 weeks. Health/medical information and blood were collected at each visit. Circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)-I, sTNFR-II, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1 were measured, and changes between baseline levels (visit 1, while smoking) and visits 2 through 4 were determined.
In our study, 206 nonobese habitually snoring children with polysomnographically diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) to 206 obese children. Size estimates of tonsils and adenoids, and Mallampati class scores were obtained, and allowed for the assessment of potential relationships between anatomic factors and obesity in pediatric OSA.
Lung function (FEV(1)), FeNO, and pH in argon-deaerated EBC were measured before and at intervals up to 30 days after a specific inhalation challenge in 15 subjects with isocyanate asthma, in 24 not sensitized control subjects exposed to isocyanates, and in 3 nonasthmatic subjects with rhinitis induced by isocyanate. Induced sputum was collected before and 24 h after isocyanate exposure.
A cohort of 110 IPF patients was evaluated. Clinical data were collected from clinical charts. High-resolution CT (HRCT) scans were examined by an expert blinded to clinical data, and patients were classified into the following two groups: patients with IPF with emphysema; and patients with IPF without emphysema. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression model were used for statistical analyses.
From the emergency department, 82 adult patients with pleural effusions were enrolled in this prospective study and divided into the following two groups: the PPPE group (n = 45); and the non-PPPE group (n = 37). Levels of pleural fluid (PF) PCT and serum (S) PCT were determined in all patients after study enrollment as well as on day 3 only in the PPPE group by a newly developed time-resolved, amplified, cryptate emission assay.
A systematic search was performed of online databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating the antiinflammatory effects of the following: (1) LABAs compared to placebo; and (2) a LABA plus ICS vs ICS alone in adults and children with asthma. Inflammatory outcome measures included cell counts and markers of cell activation in sputum, BAL fluid, bronchial biopsy specimens, serum, and exhaled nitric oxide (ENO). Data were independently extracted by two study investigators and analyzed to generate standardized mean differences using either a fixed or random-effects metaanalysis depending on the degree of heterogeneity.
SBPV and HRV were recorded during 5 min of controlled breathing in men and women who were 70 years of age. FEV(1) and VC were recorded in 901 subjects. Of them, information on HRV and SBPV was available in 820 and 736 subjects, respectively. Measures of autonomic function, that is, SBPV in the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) domains, HRV, and baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), were studied in sex-specific quartiles of FEV(1) and VC.
A retrospective review of 100 patients (CVD-UIP, 39 patients; IPF/UIP, 61 patients) with UIP pattern diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy at one tertiary referral center.
Three hundred forty-one patients were hospitalized for the first time because of a COPD exacerbation in nine teaching hospitals in Spain. COPD diagnosis was confirmed by spirometry under stable conditions. Physical activity before the first COPD hospitalization was measured using the Yale questionnaire. The following outcome variables were studied under stable conditions: dyspnea, nutritional status, complete lung function tests, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, bronchial colonization, and systemic inflammation.
We analyzed trends in AIDS-associated PCP hospital discharges using the National Hospital Discharge Surveys between 1986 and 2005.
We examined hemodynamic data from the 11,523 unique patients undergoing simultaneous right-heart and left-heart catheterization at a large academic center from 1998 to 2007.
In a prospective, multicenter cohort study of 376 patients who had undergone lung transplantation between 2002 and 2007, we measured soluble P-selectin levels before lung transplantation and at 6 and 24 h after lung reperfusion in 20 patients with grade III PGD (Pao(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen, &lt; 200 mm Hg [with alveolar infiltrates seen on chest radiographs]) at 72 h after transplantation and 61 control subjects without PGD.
This multicenter, mixed qualitative and quantitative study took place at three hospitals in California from 2006 to 2007. We conducted semistructured interviews with surrogate decision makers for 50 patients who were critically ill and incapacitated that addressed their beliefs about medical futility and inductively developed an organizing framework to describe these beliefs. We used a hypothetical scenario with a modified time-trade-off design to examine the relationship between a patient's prognosis and a surrogate's willingness to withdraw life support. We used a mixed-effects regression model to examine the association between surrogates' attitudes about futility and their willingness to limit life support in the face of a very poor prognosis. Validation methods included the use and integration of multiple data sources, multidisciplinary analysis, and member checking.
Adopting a societal perspective, we developed a theoretical decision model to determine the cost-effectiveness of LPV compared to non-LPV care. Model inputs were derived from the literature and a large population-based cohort of patients with ALI. Cost-effectiveness was determined as the cost per life saved and the cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
Eighteen children completed a shortened and a standard AMP challenge, and 20 children completed repeated shortened AMP challenges. The children inhaled nebulized AMP tidally for 2 min, following which the presence of wheeze and pulse oximetric saturation (Spo(2)) was recorded prior to FOT measurement. Testing continued until the maximum dose was reached or until wheeze, a decrease in Spo(2) to &lt; 90%, or an increase in respiratory resistance at 8 Hz of 2.0 hPa/s/L or 30% was noted. Concordance was assessed as a binary response, and agreement in provocation concentrations (PCs) causing a response was assessed with intraclass correlations.
A retrospective analysis was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO) and in the medical ICU of Mayo Medical Center (Rochester, MN). Patients hospitalized with septic shock were enrolled into the study if they met the American-European Consensus definition of ALI within 72 h of septic shock onset. Adequate initial fluid resuscitation (AIFR) was defined as the administration of an initial fluid bolus of &gt;or= 20 mL/kg prior to and achievement of a central venous pressure of &gt;or= 8 mm Hg within 6 h after the onset of therapy with vasopressors. Conservative late fluid management (CLFM) was defined as even-to-negative fluid balance measured on at least 2 consecutive days during the first 7 days after septic shock onset.
A series of 60 thymic neoplasms was reviewed and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) scheme. Key clinical information, including Masaoka stage, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) was obtained. The percentage and staining intensity of listed markers were recorded. The correlation of markers and clinicopathologic variables was statistically analyzed using the Fisher exact test and log-rank test.
Bile acid levels were measured by spectrophotometric enzymatic assay, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to quantify the major bile acids. Alveolar cells were grown on modified air-liquid interface culture inserts, and bile acids were then employed to stimulate the cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were used to determine the involved gene expression and protein levels.
This is a register-linkage case-control study of Finnish public sector employees who had received a diagnosis of sleep apnea between 1995 and 2005 (n = 957) and randomly selected control subjects who had not received a diagnosis of sleep apnea (n = 4,785), matched for age, gender, socioeconomic position, type of employment, and organization. The annual sum of lost workdays, due to either medically certified sickness absences or disability pensions prior to diagnosis, was calculated for each participant (mean follow-up time, 5 years).
We used a post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC ratio of &lt; 0.70 to define COPD. Exacerbation was self-reported and defined by symptoms (deterioration of breathing symptoms that affected usual daily activities or caused missed work).
Between 2001 and 2004, we performed a retrospective, observational study of 11,295 ICU patients from 35 hospitals in the California Intensive Care Outcomes Project. We compared the accuracy of the following three LOS models: a recalibrated acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) IV-LOS model; and models developed using risk factors in the mortality probability model III at zero hours (MPM(0)) and the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II mortality prediction model. We evaluated models by calculating the following: (1) grouped coefficients of determination; (2) differences between observed and predicted LOS across subgroups; and (3) intraclass correlations of observed/expected LOS ratios between models.
In this article, we systematically review the literature that addresses the effects of NMES applied to the muscles of ambulation. We focused on the effects of NMES on strength, exercise capacity, and disease-specific health status in patients with CHF or COPD. We also address the methodological quality of the reported studies as well as the safety of NMES. Manuscripts published prior to December 2007 were identified by searching the Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, CINAHL, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases.
We examined 5,633 (projected, 62.4 million) US adults (age range, 18 to 79 years) in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, who were never-smokers and were without known cardiovascular or obstructive lung disease. Cox regression (adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity) was used to examine all-cause mortality risk across FVC categories (FVC: low, &lt;or= 85% predicted; intermediate, 86 to 94% predicted; and high, &gt;or= 95% predicted) among those with MetS, DM, or neither disease.
Three months after the CLIP Study completion, participants and parents returned mailed surveys that assessed post-study lens purchase and symptoms related to contact lens wear if contact lenses wear had been continued. Responses were compared between the children and teens using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test.
A retrospective non-comparative case series of 14 consecutive patients (22 eyes) who were referred to one senior optometrist for the fitting of S-LIM contact lenses at Moorfields Eye Hospital. The cases comprised of 11 patients (17 eyes) with keratoconus, 1 patient (2 eyes) post-surgical ectasia from previous LASIK, 1 (1 eye) post-graft patient, and 1 patient (2 eyes) who required corneal protection secondary to lagophthalmos. These patients had failed previously with other lens designs because of lens intolerance, unstable vision, chronic 3 and 9 o'clock corneal staining, and inadequate corneal protection for the patient with lagophthalmos. A conventional method of using diagnostic lenses with fluorescein assessment was adopted in fitting the S-LIM lenses.
Comparison of the effect of MPS A (Renu MultiPlus, Bausch &amp; Lomb), MPS B (OPTI-FREE Express, Alcon), MPS C (AQuify, CibaVision), and MPS D (OPTI-FREE RepleniSH, Alcon) on cell viability was performed by quantifying cellular ATP content, resazurin reduction, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in transformed human corneal epithelial cells (HCEpiC) and primary bovine corneal epithelial cells (BCEpiC).
An acrylic resin model was used. The central incisors simulated injured teeth, with increased vertical and horizontal mobility. The lateral incisors and canines stimulated uninjured teeth. Tooth mobility was measured with the Periotest device. Vertical and horizontal measurements were made before and after splinting, and the difference between values was defined as the splint effect. We evaluated 4 composite splints, 3 wire-composite splints, a titanium trauma splint, a titanium ring splint, a bracket splint, and 2 Schuchardt splints
The sample included 100 individuals with a medical diagnosis of CP (SG) aged 1-15 years (mean 7 years 2 months +/-SD 3 years 4 months) and 100 non-disabled individuals (CG), aged 1-15 years (mean 7 years 5 months +/- SD 4 years 0 month), presenting the same socioeconomic level as SG. Data were collected through clinical examinations according to Andreasen criteria and interviews.
The study was conducted on five different groups of professionals (elementary school teachers, physical education professionals, bank employees, dental doctors, and pediatricians) from the city of Bras√≠lia, DF, Brazil. The professionals attended a lecture and were evaluated by a questionnaire applied twice, before and after the lecture.
Indifferently using m-phones of different brands, and a variety of microscopic preparations, images were taken without the use of any adaptor simply approaching the lens of the mobile cell phone camera to the ocular of common optical microscopes, and subsequently sent via Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) to distant reference centres for tele-diagnosis. Access to MMS service was reviewed with specific reference to the African information communication technology (ICT) market.
Criteria for practice-based teaching were developed at a workshop at a national conference. An online Delphi questionnaire invited educationalists to label these criteria as 'essential', 'desirable' or 'unnecessary' for 'occasional', 'intensive' and 'foundation year' teaching. Two rounds of the Delphi were completed. The views about the criteria of a range of stakeholders were explored using focus groups and telephone interviews.
This study used focus group interviews to compare and contrast the expectations and experiences of three distinct groups: General practitioners (GPs) who completed the traditional three-year training programme and were interviewed after one year of independent practice. GPRs who were the first entrants into the new extended year of training who were interviewed at the beginning and at the end of the year. GP trainers who were the first trainers involved in the extended year of training who were also interviewed at the beginning and at the end of the year.
Forty patients scheduled for abdominal surgery aged 30-70 years were enrolled. The electrodes of both the cerebral state monitor and BIS were attached simultaneously. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and fentanyl, and was maintained with sevoflurane with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and intermittent epidural mepivacaine. During surgery, end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was kept at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% for more than 10 min to measure CSI and BIS.
In a randomized, double-blind multicentre study, 188 orthopaedic patients were randomized to receive intrathecally placebo, 0.1 mg morphine or 0.2 mg morphine in addition to 15 mg bupivacaine. The primary outcome parameter was the number of patients without any additional request for opioid during a period of 72 h after surgery.
We measured isometric tension of endothelium-denuded arterial rings from rat mesentery. The relaxing effects of ketamine, after rings were precontracted with noradrenaline (10 mumol l) or high KCl (70 mmol l), were examined. The effects of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5), a competitive NMDAr blocker that is structurally distinct from ketamine, were also examined. The relaxing effects of ketamine in the presence of AP-5 were compared with those in the absence of AP-5. The effects of NMDAr agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate and glutamate were analysed in order to examine the existence of a functional NMDAr.
The study participants comprised 40 patients for oral intubation and 20 patients for nasal intubation. Each group was then divided into control and Endoflex subgroups. In the oral intubation study, controls were intubated using a standard Macintosh-type laryngoscope with a conventional endotracheal tube with adjuvant use of a stylet, whereas the Endoflex group was intubated using a Macintosh-type laryngoscope with an Endoflex tube. In the nasal intubation study, controls were intubated by a standard Macintosh-type laryngoscope with an endotracheal tube for nasal intubation. Under direct vision, Magill forceps were used to guide the tip of the endotracheal tube into the glottis. Patients in the Endoflex group were intubated using a Macintosh-type laryngoscope with an Endoflex tube.
Thirty insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, 40-80 years of age, were subjected to femoral artery bypass or knee amputation under general anaesthesia. The insulin glargine group (n = 15) was treated with insulin glargine (two-thirds of the total daily insulin dose required) subcutaneous administration with 5% dextrose solution infusion. The GIK group (n = 15) was treated with GIK infusion (125 ml h). Blood glucose levels were checked every 30 min during anaesthesia and 1 h after extubation. Potassium was checked every 1 h during anaesthesia and 2-4 h after extubation. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t test.
Our study used a consecutive sample of 260 day surgery patients to explore possible relationships between personal traits, measured by a short Big Five scale, and postoperative recovery, measured by modified Quality of Recovery-40, on postoperative days 1, 7 and 14.
A 26-item survey questionnaire (organization of the maternity unit, preoperative evaluation, technical aspects describing regional or general anaesthesia, oxytocic and antibiotic drugs, postoperative analgesia) was distributed to all French obstetric units (excluding overseas).
Eighty-seven patients undergoing elective breast surgery with total i.v. anaesthesia (propofol/remifentanil) were randomized to three groups. Group para received 1 g i.v. paracetamol 20 min before and 4, 10 and 16 h after the end of the operation. Group meta and plac received 1 g i.v. metamizol or placebo, respectively, scheduled at the same time points. All patients had access to i.v. morphine on demand to achieve adequate pain relief.
Forty patients were enrolled for this prospective study. We recorded every adverse neurological event after arterial clamping and variations in parameters evaluated by the two monitoring systems in order to determine whether there was any correlation between TCD data and those obtained by regional cerebral saturation, the timing of detection of the adverse event in both clinical examination and instrumental data and the presence of any false positives or negatives in any of the two monitoring systems.
We performed a total of 84 medial branch blocks in 20 obese patients (body mass index, &gt;30 kg/m2) using ultrasound. We studied the success rate, measured depth to the facet joint, and assessed radiation dose and pain relief.
All prehospital patients who underwent CVC positioning by emergency medical services physicians in the greater area of Thessaloniki during a 2-year period were included. A two-lumen indwelling polyurethane 8F catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique in all cases. Patients' demographics and underlying diseases, site of access, number of attempts, time spent for catheter placement, and insertion-related complications were recorded.
From July 2003 to February 2004, a prospective cohort study was conducted in an ED (Elbeuf Reference Hospital, Upper-Normandy region). Baseline data collection was performed during individual interview at inclusion. Waiting time in the ED was recorded. Patient satisfaction was assessed by telephone 1 month later. Questions included assessment of overall satisfaction and three different areas of satisfaction: quality of reception, patient-doctor communication, and delays.
One thousand fifty-nine consecutive surgical and medical patients entering the ED of the University Hospital Basel during an 11-day period were independently assessed by hospital admission staff without formal medical training, ED nursing staff, and ED physicians. Emergencies were classified by severity (intervention within minutes/hours/days) or by severity and resource utilization (immediate intervention with/without life-threatening condition, delayed intervention with high/low/no demand of resources). Emergency assessment and triage decision (surgical/medical, outpatient/inpatient treatment) were documented independently by all three ED staff groups.
Blood relatives and spouses of all adult patients presenting to our emergency department in Turkey between 7 January 2005 and 16 January 2005 were included in the study. Accompanying persons other than patients' relatives were excluded. Surveys were conducted using a structured face-to-face interview with the participants.
Creation of a website, which can be consulted 24 h a day by physicians from European community.
Data on CL material and design, care system, and ocular complications were recorded and statistically analyzed for CL wearers.
Four eye care practitioners licensed in the practice of optometry in each country were sent sets of limbal redness images that were printed from the Efron Grading Scale morphing program. Each set consisted of 18 images randomly selected over the range of 0 to 4, inclusive. Each image was printed on a separate page with the grade scale from 0 to 4 with 0.5 steps. Each practitioner received the same set of images that were packaged in random order. Seventy-two (72) grades were collected from each country, which exceeded the sample size estimates for both the between and within country objectives.
Twenty eyes of 20 patients underwent placement of 21 ProKera implants between March 2006 and July 2007 at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Patient demographics, indications for placement, and duration of ProKera retention were recorded. Outcomes measured included corneal epithelial healing, visual acuity, patient tolerance, and adverse events.
A patient of retinitis pigmentosa with spontaneous bilateral anterior in-the-bag subluxation of PCIOL was managed by IOL explantation followed by fibrin-glue-assisted sutureless PCIOL implantation. Two partial thickness limbal-based scleral flaps were created about 1.5 mm from the limbus under which sclerotomies were made. Intraocular lens explantation along with capsular bag was performed through the corneo-scleral tunnel incision. Single-piece rigid polymethylmethacrylate 6.5-mm optic IOL was introduced through the limbal wound with a McPherson forceps, both the IOL haptics were externalized under the scleral flap. The haptic ends were tucked in the scleral tunnel made with the 26G needle. Scleral flaps and the conjunctiva were closed with the fibrin glue.
Thirteen eyes of 13 patients who underwent DSAEK without preoperative corneal haze or scar obvious at the slit lamp, any ocular disease, and postoperative complication were included in the study. All patients were examined clinically and by CM 6 months after DSAEK.
Retrospective cohort study. Charts of patients diagnosed with HSV keratitis seen at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2001 and December 2004 were reviewed.
A package containing 20 patient surveys was sent to 309 eye care practitioners (ECPs) in the United States who had agreed to participate in the study. One thousand eight hundred fifty-nine completed surveys were received from 158 ECPs and 1,654 surveys were eligible for analysis. Questions related to patient demographics, lens type, lens wearing patterns, the ECP instructions for RF, and the actual patient reported RF. ECPs were asked to provide lens information and their recommendation for RF after the surveys had been completed and sealed in envelopes. All responses were anonymous.
A previously healthy 30-year-old man presented with bilateral decreased vision, redness, and irritation, beginning 1 week earlier. The patient had been treated with moxifloxocin for 1 week before presentation without improvement. Bacterial staining cultures were performed from corneal scrapings, contact lenses, contact lens case, and solution. Preliminary culture results and antibiotic sensitivities were generated using an automated identification system. Positive results from the contact lens, case, and solution were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
In this open-label, bilateral, 3-month dispensing study, 59 children (8-11 years) were fit with etafilcon A spherical or toric daily disposable lenses (1-DAY ACUVUE or 1-DAY ACUVUE for ASTIGMATISM, Vistakon, Jacksonville, FL). All subjects were neophytes requiring visual correction in both eyes. The refractive inclusion criteria were plano to -9.00 diopter (D) with astigmatism of &lt; or =2.00DC in both eyes, or hyperopia of +0.50 to +6.00D with astigmatism of 0.75D or less. The subjects underwent follow-up evaluations, which included a questionnaire for parents and subjects, at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.
Two groups of subjects, 15 with clinically diagnosed blepharitis (11 women and 5 men mol/L; age 60.9 +/- 12.5; range 41-79) and 15 age- and sex-matched controls (11 women and 5 men mol/L; age 60.7 +/- 12.6; range 40-78), were included in the study. Tear physiology was assessed by evaporimetry and interferometry and the meibomian glands by expression and meibography.
Patient with schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia developed bilateral corneal edema while receiving chronic amantadine hydrochloride.

A total of 203 prophylactic-naive migraine/chronic migraine patients, 17 (8.4%) male, 186 (91.6%) female, aged 19 to 65 years were serially selected and asked to answer bidirectional visual numerical scales designed for this purpose, with 1 scale for each side effect. The question posed was: "How much would you accept or reject the following side effects to get rid of your migraine headaches?" The side effects listed were dry mouth, epigastric burning, low energy, tingling, somnolence, depression, tremor, insomnia, memory loss, sluggishness, weight gain, and weight loss.
Nineteen subjects having migraine with aura were studied using a 4-way crossover, open-label design. Each patient was asked to treat 8 consecutive attacks with 100 mg of sumatriptan RT: 3 attacks treated at a timing of the patient's discretion (baseline); 1 attack treated 4 hours after onset of pain (late); 2 attacks treated within 1 hour of onset of pain (early); 2 attacks treated during the aura phase - before the onset of pain (aura). Pain level and cutaneous allodynia were reported by the patients at the onset of pain, at the time of treatment, and 2 and 24 hours after treatment.
A lumbar laminectomy is performed, a strip of dura is resected, and the dural defect is closed. The resulting decrease in lumbar CSF volume is believed to increase intracranial CSF volume and pressure.
Forty-two patients suffering from frequent headaches (20 +/- 9 headache days/month; range: 8-30) were treated and evaluated in a 96-hour group program. The results were compared with the outcomes of the previous study. Subjects who had undergone either the 20-hour multidisciplinary program or the primary care were used as historical control groups.
In 11 patients with medically refractory migraine, the sphenopalatine fossa was accessed with a 20-gauge needle using the standard infrazygomatic transcoronoid approach under fluoroscopy. Patients underwent temporary unilateral electric stimulation of the SPG with a Medtronic 3057 test stimulation lead after induction of full-blown migraine. Both sham and active stimulations with different settings were carried out for &lt; or =60 minutes, and then the lead was removed.
Two replicate, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-attack crossover trials evaluated migraineurs who had discontinued a short-acting triptan in the past year because of poor response or intolerance. Patients were instructed to treat within 1 hour and while pain was mild.
Out of 22,000 pharmacies currently open in France, a questionnaire was proposed to a random sample of approximately 4000 pharmacies with at least 1 self-considered migraineur in the pharmacy staff who accepted to complete and return the questionnaire. The reality of migraine was assessed by the study questionnaire according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II) criteria. In addition, the study questionnaire inquired about subjects' demographics, headache characteristics, consumption of medications for headaches, subjects' satisfaction with the usual treatment of headaches and treatment effectiveness. Medication overuse was defined in terms of treatment days per month during the previous 3 months according to the ICHD-II criteria for medication overuse headache.
A structured questionnaire was administered to subjects with: episodic migraine (EM) (n = 30), chronic migraine (CM) (n = 24), and MOH with a previous history of EM (n = 33) and 29 control subjects. Psychiatric diagnoses were made by a senior psychiatrist blinded to the diagnosis of migraine. Psychiatric assessment of OCD illness was evaluated by means of The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).
Analyses were based on data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin (studies 1056 and 1077). In a daily diary, patients reported the quality of their sleep on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 ("best possible sleep") to 10 ("worst possible sleep"). Test re-test reliability of the Sleep Quality Scale was evaluated by computing intraclass correlation coefficients. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between baseline Sleep Quality scores and baseline pain diary and Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep scores. Responsiveness to treatment was evaluated by standardized effect sizes computed as the difference between least squares mean changes in Sleep Quality scores in the pregabalin and placebo groups divided by the standard deviation of Sleep Quality scores across all patients at baseline.
Ninety-two persons with definite MS residing in the community were recruited from a tertiary hospital database. Patients completed the MSIS-29 as part of a larger study. Rasch analysis was undertaken to assess the psychometric properties of the MSIS-29.
The intervention consisted of six workshops, attended by 29 of 31 trained nurses and nurse attendants working on the paediatric ward. Parental satisfaction with nursing care was measured with 288 parents before and six weeks after the workshops, by means of an adapted Picker questionnaire. Two focus-group discussions were held with the workshop participants six months after the intervention.
Potential confounders influencing the intervention's success were identified by literature review, and grouped by healthcare setting specific change stages. An international multi-disciplinary (clinical, administrative, decision maker, management) panel evaluated these factors in a two-stage modified-delphi and nominal group process based on four domains: change readiness, evidence base, face validity, and clarity of definition.
A cohort study was conducted on 50 consecutive patients clinically diagnosed as cutaneous vasculitis in the dermatology outdoor; irrespective of age, sex and duration of the disease. Based on the clinical presentation, vasculitis was classified according to modified Gilliam's classification. All patients were subjected to a baseline workup consisting of complete hemogram, serum-creatinine levels, serum-urea, liver function tests, chest X-ray, urine (routine and microscopic) examination besides antistreptolysin O titer, Mantoux test, cryoglobulin levels, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies and hepatitis B and C. Histopathological examination was done in all patients while immunofluorescence was done in 23 patients.
In a case-control setting, 150 clinically and histopathologically proven MF patients had been admitted to the tertiary referral skin center during a 10-year period and another 150 normal volunteers had been compared with each other for the presence of HTLV-1 infection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect antibodies against HTLV-1, and positive results were confirmed with western blotting.
This is a prospective study which assesses the impacts of keloid on keloid patients. Consented patients who presented to the Plastic Surgery Clinic of the Lautech Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Nigeria were recruited into the study. A set of questionnaires were administered to all consented patients. The administered questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS version 10.
Pemphigus patients who had been treated with DCP therapy from 2001 to 2008 were prospectively and retrospectively analyzed.
In this cross-sectional study in male prisoners of Bandarabbas city, 230 prisoners were randomly selected. One hundred and five (45.67%) of them were diagnosed to be infected. They were also evaluated regarding age, duration of being imprisoned, skin color, site of lesion and its pigmentation change and any concomitant clinical manifestation such as pruritus, burning or cebure. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for data analysis.
The model was created using NetLogo. The hairs were modeled as agents oscillating between anagen and telogen. The variables were assigned based on published data whenever possible and the various paths the agent could take were coded as conditional statements. The improvement was assessed using an arbitrary index which takes into account the mean diameter and pigmentation along with the number and length of hairs visible above the surface. Few of the commonly encountered scenarios were simulated using the model.
Multiplex PCR was attempted to detect the opportunistic herpes viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, and CMV), adenovirus and polyoma viruses (JC and BK) in three cocktails of PCR reactions. Subsequently, all the viruses detected were quantitated by testing using monoplex real time PCR. Whole blood samples collected between 2006 and 2007 from 68 treatment na√Øve HIV-1 infected and 30 normal healthy individuals were tested for these eight viruses. Among the 68 HIV-1 infected individuals 35 had CD4+ T cell count less than or equal to 200 while the other 33 had greater than 200 CD4+ T cells.
From March 2005 to December 2007, 14,597 specimens were processed using the MGIT 960 system and the results were compared with conventional L.J medium. We standardised r-nitro benzoic acid (PNBA) assay on MGIT 960 TB system for identification of M. tuberculosis complex and evaluated its usefulness by comparing the results with an in-house molecular assay and sequencing.
One hundred and twenty five blood samples suggestive of symptomatic congenital CMV infection were selected from samples received at NICD during the period June 2005-March 2007. A request to collect and send the urine samples of the selected babies was sent to the respective hospitals. Serum samples of the babies were tested for CMV-IgM antibodies using micro-capture ELISA. Mothers' serum samples were subjected to CMV-IgM and IgG class antibodies assay by commercial ELISA kits. DNA isolation and amplification was performed in urine samples and some of the serum samples using a commercial PCR kit for detection of HCMV. Blood and urine samples from 20 normal babies were included in the study.

We review the development of automated bone age assessment and describe how the conceptual understanding of bone age rating shifted from a rule-based theory to a more intuitive and experience-based approach. The role of the CASAS system from 1992 is described. The BoneXpert system from 2008 employs deformable models of each bone to locate the bones and extracts the component of the bone appearance related to maturity in a holistic, statistical manner. Two clinical studies have been published on its accuracy, defined as the root mean square deviation from manual rating. Other studies addressed the precision of the method, defined as its ability to give the same result on a repeated x-ray, expressed as the sd on a single measurement.

This is a methodological review paper.
A consecutive cohort of 500 patients 65 years of age and over were recruited prospectively from primary care over a 6 month period in a provincial town in Ireland. Patients' medical records (electronic and paper) were screened and all relevant information concerning current illnesses and medications was recorded on a standardized data collection form to which Beers' criteria [considering diagnosis (CD) and independent of diagnosis (ID)] and IPET tools were applied. The NIC was calculated from an edition of the Irish monthly index of medical specialities published concurrently with the data collection.
We analysed all prescriptions dispensed from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 to individuals aged 65 or more registered under the Local Health Authority of Lecco, a northern Italian province with a population of almost 330 000 persons. Elderly who received at least two co-administered prescriptions were selected to assess the presence of DDIs.
Medical records of 695 patients participating in a clinical trial which was designed to reduce use of antibiotics for ARTI in primary care, were linked to their prescriptions. Matching of prescribed and dispensed medications enabled the assessment of interventions by community pharmacists.
A questionnaire was developed around those used in UK and Australasian studies of general practitioners' attitudes towards research. Questions assessed attitudes to research, involvement in research, barriers and facilitators to involvement, self-assessed understanding of research terminology, and access to and use of electronic bibliographic databases. One thousand pharmacists were randomly and proportionately selected from the State and Territory Pharmacy Board registers to receive the anonymous questionnaire by mail. Non-respondents were sent a follow-up reminder and second copy of the questionnaire after 3 weeks.
The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial. Adult patients were selected if: (i) they were taking one or more lipid-lowering agents with a valid lipid panel before their next follow up; (ii) had a baseline lipid profile within the previous 6 months; (iii) their lipid panel did not reach the targeted low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal based on the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III. Pharmacists interviewed patients in the intervention group for 15-30 min to provide consultation on the drug regimen and lifestyle modifications. A telephone follow-up every 4 weeks and a follow-up interview on the date of the physician visit were scheduled. Patients in the control group received routine conventional care. The primary outcome measurement was the change in lipid panel between baseline and at the end of study.
The screening encompassed 249 records of 114 epileptic patients aged 0-19 years old, who were treated with VPA monotherapy and whose total and unbound VPA concentrations were determined. These data were divided into groups according to the patients' age. In each group, the relationship between total and unbound VPA concentrations was compared to a reference profile, and the deviation from the reference was evaluated. The reference profile was calculated using the Langmuir equation, in which two parameters Kd and Bm were set to 7.8 and 130 microg/mL, respectively, according to our previous findings.
Solutions of 250 mL of 5% dextrose in polyolefin bags (n = 5) containing approximately 400 mg of calcium levofolinate were prepared under aseptic conditions and frozen for 95 days at -20 degrees C. The solutions were then thawed using microwaves and stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C for 1 month. The calcium levofolinate concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Visual inspection was performed and pH was measured periodically during the storage at 5 +/- 3 degrees C. Stability of the solution was defined as a concentration remaining superior to 90% of the initial concentration by regression analysis as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
We searched across diverse studies conducted in Korea and the Knowledge Base for Korean Pharmacogenomics Research Network operated by Seoul National University to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CYP1A2 gene and to choose frequently occurring SNPs in a Korean population. We analyzed and confirmed the frequencies of CYP1A2 SNPs that are inferred as MAF &gt;0.05 in 400 healthy Korean subjects, using direct sequencing and a TaqMan assay. The LD block and haplotypes were constructed from the SNP databases in the other races registered in the International HapMap (Europeans, Chinese, Japanese and Africans) and the haplotype frequencies in each race were compared with those in the Korean population.
We analysed the single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes of the CYP2C19 gene in 150 healthy Koreans and found three major (frequency &gt; 0.1) haplotypes (H1, H2 and H3). One oral dose of 40 mg omeprazole (Losec) was administered to 30 subjects grouped as H1/H1, H2/H2, H1/H2, H1/H3 and H2/H3. The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyomeprazole and omeprazole sulphone, in those groups was analysed.
This study assessed the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in the NK2R gene and chronic cough in 91 patients taking ACE inhibitors. Patients included in the study did not have chest abnormalities, postnasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux or a recent history of upper respiratory infection.
Two-compartment model-based Japanese population parameters for VCM were used, and the mean prediction error (ME) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were calculated as indices of bias and accuracy, respectively, for predictions by the PM and Bayesian methods.
A two-compartment open model was adopted as a pharmacokinetic model. The nonlinear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the population pharmacokinetic models.
There were 135 patients eligible for assessment of the status of urinary continence after surgery. The patients were divided into two groups according to the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 score: Group 1, &gt;or=14 (56 patients); group 2, &lt;14 (79 patients). The correlation between urinary continence and patient age at surgery, body mass index, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, preoperative IIEF-5 score, and an attempted nerve-sparing procedure was investigated.
A total of 20 domestic swine were randomized into four equal groups. Each subject underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy to create the condition of a solitary kidney. On the contralateral side, a laparoscopic lower pole partial nephrectomy was performed, employing either selective or nonselective vascular clamping for either 60 or 90 minutes. Postoperatively, clinical status and serial serum studies were closely monitored for 1 week.
Between December 2006 and July 2007, 21 intraoperative pre- and postcryoablation (18-gauge core) biopsies of renal masses were obtained. Evaluation of the biopsies by the institutional uropathologist was followed by a blind assessment by two other uropathologists. Tumor subtype and Fuhrman grade were determined by the three pathologists, while biopsy timing (before or after cryoablation) was only assessed by the two blinded pathologists. The diagnostic yield of the pre- and postcryoablation biopsies and interobserver agreement were calculated.
Eighty-nine urologists and residents in urology performed a urethrocystoscopy task (bladder inspection, biopsy, and coagulation) or a ureterorenoscopy task (manipulation of a distal ureter stone) using the URO Mentor. They completed an evaluation questionnaire about these tasks. Questionnaire bias related to task performance on URO Mentor was analyzed as well (Hawthorne effect).
Thirty-four patients with bladder tumor were submitted to TURB in our academic institution in April 2006, and were prospectively studied. Procedures were all done by senior residents under an attending direct supervision. All patients had a cystograms performed after the procedure by the injection of 400 mL of saline-diluted contrast solution with low-pressure infusion through the Foley catheter. The cystograms were evaluated blindly by a single radiologist. All patients were examined by cystoscopy and/or CT every 3 months for the first 2 years postoperatively.
Between 1995 and 2006, 49 patients under dialysis or after kidney transplantation underwent simultaneous bilateral nephroureterectomy for clinically presumed localized UUT-UC at our institute. Of those, 33 underwent HALBNU and 16 received conventional open surgery. Perioperative and pathological data and oncological outcomes were collected by chart review. Bladder recurrence, metastasis, and cancer-specific and overall survival were analyzed and compared between both groups.
Between January 2006 and October 2007, 1000 consecutive transurethral resection (TUR), 376 transurethral resection of prostate, 480 transurethral resection of bladder neoplasm, and 144 transurethral incision of prostate were performed. All procedures were carried out with a bipolar device in physiologic saline (TURis). The resectoscope used was an Olympus 26F in continuous flow-type Iglesias with continuous aspiration. The loops were all disposable/single use. The incidence of unwanted stimulation of the obturator reflex, TUR syndrome, thermal skin lesion, blood transfusion, urethral strictures, and bladder neck contractures were recorded.
After approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, 10 female pigs underwent bilateral transperitoneal laparoscopic lower pole heminephrectomy. Closure of the collecting system and approximation of the renal parenchyma was performed in two layers using continuous knotless barbed suture for one kidney (Quill SRS) and polyglactin (Vicryl) with absorbable polydioxanone clips (LapraTy; Ethicon) on the contralateral kidney. For both techniques, the collecting system was closed with 2-0 suture and renal parenchyma with #1 suture. Warm ischemia and suturing time were recorded, and resected tissue was weighed. All animals were sacrificed 1 week after surgery. Serum hemoglobin and visual inspection at necropsy were used to assess for bleeding; visual inspection of the peritoneum and bilateral retrograde pyelography were used to assess for urinary fistula.
Six animals were included in each of the following five groups: group 1, sham operation but no treatment; group 2, unilateral ureteral ligation but no treatment; group 3, sham operation + MLT; group 4, unilateral ureteral ligation + MLT; group 5, unilateral ureteral ligation +5% ethanol (the vehicle of MLT). The injected dose of MLT was 1 mg/kg/day (intraperitoneal). MLT and vehicle were injected daily, beginning 5 days before the unilateral ureteral ligation or sham operation and until 10 days after it. At 10 days after UUO, all rats were sacrificed with high-dose ketamine. Malondialdehyde, glutathione, nitric oxide (NO), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels and inducible NO synthase (iNOS), p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) expression were studied. Histopathological examination of the obstructed kidney was also performed.
Forty-three male patients with bladder stones were randomized into two groups, to perform nephroscopic (group 1, n = 22) and cystoscopic (group 2, n = 21) stone fragmentation procedures transurethrally. Combined pneumatic/ultrasonic lithotripsy device was used in both groups to fragment the bladder stones.
Twenty-five rabbits were divided into two groups with 11 rabbits in each group. Both kidneys of the remaining three rabbits served as a sham group. All animals underwent right ureteral ligation using surgical clips. In group 1 (n = 6), 1500 SWs were applied to the obstructed kidney after 3 days of ligation, and the kidneys were removed on day 4. Group 1 control (n = 5) animals also underwent nephrectomy on day 4 without receiving SWs. Group 2 (n = 6) animals received the same dose of SWs after 6 days of ureteral ligation and were nephrectomized on day 7. Group 2 control (n = 5) animals did not receive SWs and were nephrectomized on day 7. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for HSP70 expression, and staining intensity was graded semiquantatively.
From October 2005 to October 2007, 104 patients underwent PCNL in our hospital. We compared the patients who undergone previous open surgery on the same kidney (group 1; n = 36) with those who had undergone no previous surgery (group 2; n = 68). We extracted requested information such as age, sex, stone number, stone burden, intraoperative and postoperative complications, hospital stay, access time, operative time, and success rate. The results of the study were analyzed using SPSS 10 software.
Prospectively maintained Institutional Regulatory Board-approved databases were searched to identify patients treated with percutaneous RFA using contrast-enhanced CT under GA. A total of 163 masses in 151 patients were treated. Enhancement on imaging or a positive biopsy at 4 to 6 weeks was considered incomplete ablation. Positive findings beyond this interval were defined as local recurrence.
Patients with CRI undergoing LRC for small enhancing renal masses were retrospectively evaluated for renal function changes after surgery. From February 2001 to July 2007, 123 patients underwent LRC; 77 of these had preoperative and postoperative creatinine levels (Cr) for evaluation, and 14 of these had renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency was defined as a Cr level &gt;1.3 mg/dL. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Complications were reviewed.
Ten ureteroenteric strictures in patients with ileal conduits that were managed with metallic ureteral stenting were retrospectively identified. Charts were examined for patient age, anastomosis type, stricture cause, stricture laterality, complications, and follow-up.
Nineteen human stones were measured using manual calipers. A 10-MHz, 1/8'' (10F) ultrasound transducer probe pinged each stone on a kidney tissue phantom submerged in water using two methods. In Method 1, the instrument was aligned such that the ultrasound pulse traveled through the stone. In Method 2, the instrument was aligned partially over the stone such that the ultrasound pulse traveled through water.
Eight patients with long-term stents were enrolled prospectively. All received a control stent for 3 months along with preoperative and postoperative antibiotics. After 3 months, the control stent was removed, and a triclosan-eluting stent was placed for 3 months with no antibiotics administered. For both indwelling periods, urine cultures were obtained weekly and biweekly for the first and last 6 weeks, respectively, and antibiotics were prescribed when patients had both a positive urine culture and symptoms of urinary tract infection. On removal, stents were assessed for microorganisms and encrustation.
We reviewed all patients undergoing open stone surgery for upper urinary tract stones from 1997 until 2007 at the Department of Urology, University Hospital Mannheim. A retrospective chart analysis was performed on these patients to identify factors and indications for open stone surgery. Indications for stone surgery, type of surgery performed, stone complexity, anatomical abnormities present, and the residual stone burden were reviewed.
This retrospective study included 25 women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for vesicovaginal fistula from June 2003 to November 2008. All patients were underwent laparoscopic surgery by the transabdominal transvesical route. Patients were investigated by intravenous urography, micturating cystography, cystoscopy, and retrograde pyelography.
A preliminary learning set and a classification tree of spectra derived from 24 patients with NPC and a group of 24 noncancer controls were used to develop a proteomic model that discriminated cancer from noncancer effectively. Then, the validity of the classification tree was challenged with a blind test set, which included another 20 patients with NPC and 12 noncancer controls.
Literatures searched on PubMed and Embase databases were enrolled in the Meta-analysis. The Meta-analysis of all eligible studies was applied with Stata 10.0 software, and the pooled odds ratio(OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) value were obtained. The Q test, Egger's test and Begg's funnel plot were used to evaluate the heterogeneity and publication bias between the studies.
Generation 5 (G5) through generation 8 (G8) polyamidoamine dendrimers were labeled with gadolinium (Gd)-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid, an anionic MRI contrast agent. The respective Gd-dendrimer generations were visualized in vitro by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Following intravenous infusion of the respective Gd-dendrimer generations (Gd-G5, N = 6; Gd-G6, N = 6; Gd-G7, N = 5; Gd-G8, N = 5) the blood and tumor tissue pharmacokinetics of the Gd-dendrimer generations were visualized in vivo over 600 to 700 minutes by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. One additional animal was imaged in each Gd-dendrimer generation group for 175 minutes under continuous anesthesia for the creation of voxel-by-voxel Gd concentration maps.
Ninety subjects were enrolled and divided into three groups based on the BMD values of the lumbar spine and/or the femoral neck by DXA. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of postmenopausal women with BMD changes &lt;-2SD, with and without radiographically confirmed vertebral fracture (n=11 and 33, respectively). Group 3 comprised normal controls with BMD changes &gt; or =-1SD (n=46). Post-MSCT (GE, LightSpeed16) scan reconstructed images of the abdominal-pelvic region, 1.25 mm thick per slice, were processed by OsteoCAD software to calculate the following parameters: volumetric BMD values of trabecular bone (TRAB), cortical bone (CORT), and integral bone (INTGL) of the left femoral neck, femoral neck axis length (NAL), and minimum cross-section area (mCSA). DXA BMD measurements of the lumbar spine (AP-SPINE) and the left femoral neck (NECK) also were performed for each subject.
Artificial cerebrospinal fluid with carnosine was directly administrated over the exposed rat hippocampus. The changes of neuron activity in the CA1 region of hippocampus were evaluated by orthodromically- and antidromically-evoked potentials, as well as paired-pulse stimulation paradigm.
22-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used as spontaneously occurring intervertebral disc degeneration models and 6-month-old rats as young controls. Expression of collagen types II and X was measured by immunohistochemistry. Degenerations of intervertebral discs were scored according to Miyamoto's method. Numbers and areas of afferent vascular buds were measured. The thicknesses of non-calcified and calcified layers were measured and statistically analyzed.
Rat aortic VSMCs were isolated and cultured in vitro, and treated with different concentrations of parthenolide (10, 20 and 30 mumol/L). [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was used as an index of cell proliferation. Cell cycle progression and distribution were determined by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, the expression of several regulatory proteins relevant to VSMC proliferation including IkappaBalpha, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), p21, and p27 was examined to investigate the potential molecular mechanism.
Participants saw a series of pictures with either blue or red background, and were then given a pretest for item and source memories. Then males and females respectively were randomly assigned either to a wake or a sleep condition. In the wake condition, participants remained awake until the posttest; in the sleep condition, participants slept for 1 h until awakened and asked to remain awake until the posttest.
Herein we share our experiences in the treatment of 12 patients with hepatic hydrothorax by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Repair of the diaphragmatic defects, or pleurodesis by focal pleurectomy, talc spray, mechanical abrasion, electro-cauterization or injection was administered intraoperatively, and tetracycline intrapleural injection was used postoperatively for patients with prolonged (&gt;7 d) high-output (&gt;300 ml/d) pleural effusion.

Infants were randomly assigned to receive 2 doses of PCV-7 at 2 and 4 months; 2 + 1 doses of PCV-7 at 2, 4, and 11 months; or no dosage (control group).
Vaccine serotype pneumococcal carriage rates in infants in the second year of life.
Within each of 5 community-based cohorts comprising the EchoGen consortium (stage 1; n = 12 612 individuals of European ancestry; 55% women, aged 26-95 years; examinations between 1978-2008), we estimated the association between approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; imputed to the HapMap CEU panel) and echocardiographic traits. In stage 2, SNPs significantly associated with traits in stage 1 were tested for association in 2 other cohorts (n = 4094 people of European ancestry). Using a prespecified P value threshold of 5 x 10(-7) to indicate genome-wide significance, we performed an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association data from each cohort.
Echocardiographic traits: LV mass, internal dimensions, wall thickness, systolic dysfunction, aortic root, and left atrial size.
A systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded databases using adiponectin and diabetes and various synonyms and reference lists of retrieved articles up to April 10, 2009.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Generalized least-squares trend estimation was used to assess dose-response relationships. Pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models to incorporate between-study variation.
The rat pancreatic beta cell line INS-1 was used as a cell biological model since it exhibits glucose dependent insulin secretion. Insulin production assessment was carried out using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and cAMP quantification with competitive ELISA. Viability of TNF-alpha and oleic acid treated cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. PPAR-gamma translocation was assessed using a PPRE based ELISA system. In vivo studies were carried out on adult male KKAy mice and glucose levels were measured with a glucometer.
Malaria death was defined as a death from fever with microscopically confirmed Plasmodium falciparum among residents of Jalpaiguri during 2007-2008. For each case, three age-, sex- and locality-matched controls were recruited among microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria patients cured during the same period. Clinical and treatment information was abstracted from records. Information about knowledge about malaria, presence of bed nets and DDT spraying was collected through interviews of the close relatives of study subjects. Odds ratio (OR) were calculated using multivariate methods.
DNA and RNA sequences analysis as well as phylogenetic approaches were used to analyse the stevor sequence repertoire and diversity in laboratory lines and Kilifi (Kenya) fresh isolates.
Our study was conducted on 63 rats at Experimental Research Center of Celal Bayar University. Six-month-old rats were divided into seven groups. There were five drug administered ovariectomized groups, one ovariectomized control group without drug administration and one non-ovariectomized control group without drug administration. Eight weeks postovariectomy, rats were treated with the bisphosphonate risedronate sodium, the statin atorvastatin, the estrogen 17beta-estradiol and the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) raloxifene hydrochloride and clomiphene citrate by gavage daily for 8 weeks. At the end of the study, rats were killed under anesthesia. For densitometric evaluation, left femurs and tibiae were removed. Left femurs were also used to measure bone volume. Right femurs were used for three-point bending test.
Within the NOWAC cohort we conducted a cross-sectional comparison of questionnaire data among women aged 48-62 years in 1996 (N=8822), 2002 (N=6262) and 2005 (N=4830). Response rates for first time respondents: 58% in 1996 and 66% in 2005. The 2002 participants were second time respondents including 4814 of the 1996 participants. The partial dependence was managed statistically using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and linear mixed models.
93 postmenopausal women were enrolled in a 52-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received either DHEA 50mg or placebo (PL) daily. The effects of DHEA versus placebo on lipid profile, insulin-glucose homeostasis and the endomentrium were assessed over 52 weeks.
Between 2002 and 2004, the study recruited 518 postmenopausal women aged 50-64 years. They were examined by B-mode ultrasound to measure the IMT and the prevalence of plaque at the near and far walls of common carotid (CCA), bifurcation (bulb), and internal carotid (ICA) of both the left and right carotid arteries. Blood pressures, obesity indices, lipids and glucose levels, sociodemographic, medical and lifestyle factors were also obtained.
The survey involved representative samples of women 45-60 years from five Italian regions. Twenty trained interviewers distributed the questionnaires reaching participants at their homes. A total of 969 women were selected from electoral rolls. 720 of them completed the interview (74.3% response rate).
Breast cancer tissue and fasting serum were collected from 26 female patients. After microdissection of frozen samples, RNA was isolated and expression of insulin receptor, IGFR1, IGFR2, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 was measured on mRNA level by means of real time RT-PCR. Fasting insulin, glucose and c-peptide serum levels were analysed by ELISA. Insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA model.
In total, 605 consecutive community-dwelling elderly individuals who were 65 years and older were evaluated. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to determine the lowest T-score in the lumbar spine+unilateral hip, the bilateral hips, and the lumbar spine+bilateral hips. Risk factors associated with the lowest T-score in these three conditions were applied to indicate treatment in accordance with NOF criteria. McNemar's test was used to assess the difference of adding bilateral hip BMD measurements.
Metabolic profile and inflammatory parameters were determined in dyslipidemic patients with (+CAD, n = 33) and without (-CAD, n = 69) symptomatic CAD.

cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP where knocked down either individually or in combination using siRNA in androgen independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells as confirmed by real-time PCR and western blotting. Cells were then treated with TRAIL, Etoposide, or Tunicamycin, and apoptosis assessed by PI DNA staining. Apoptosis was confirmed with Annexin V labelling and measurement of PARP cleavage, and was inhibited using the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk. Clonogenic assays and assessment of ID-1 expression by western blotting were used to measure recovery and proliferation.
We measured clearance rates of 99mTc-tetrofosmin in four healthy smokers and four healthy nonsmokers and of 99mTc-sestamibi in six otherwise healthy patients with psoriasis before and after 2 weeks of therapy with cyclosporine A (2.5-5 mg/kg/day) and two healthy women taking the oral contraceptive pill, as both cyclosporine and steroids are known to be P-gp modulators.
Thirty-four patients with prior myocardial infarction underwent DE-MRI and 99mTc-sestamibi/18F-FDG SPECT. The area of delayed enhancement by DE-MRI was defined as scar tissue. The region with concordantly reduced perfusion and glucose metabolism was defined as nonviable myocardium. In a 17-segment model, the segmental extent of hyperenhancement was compared with segmental 99mTc-sestamibi and 18F-FDG uptake defect. All segments were divided into five different severities by segmental extent of hyperenhancement in DE-MRI and were classified into different viability situations by segmental 99mTc-sestamibi and 18F-FDG uptake in SPECT.
A total of 25 studies (comprising 789 patients) that were published from January 1990 to September 2008 were reviewed. These studies evaluated the role of FDG-PET and FDG-PET/CT in the detection of recurrent or metastatic DTC that radioiodine WBS failed to detect. Systematic methods were used to identify, select, and evaluate the methodological quality of the studies and to summarize the overall findings of sensitivity and specificity.
Dynamic fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET scans obtained in 20 patients with high-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade III, five lesions; grade IV, 15 lesions) and in 12 patients with CNS lymphoma (16 lesions) were retrospectively reviewed. Applying a three-compartment model, parametric images of K1, k2, k3, and k4 and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR(Glc)) were obtained.
The volunteer was seated and positioned relative to the scintillation camera field of view by means of a fixation frame. After nasal administration, a dynamic series of images was acquired for 32 min with a lateral direction of view. The images were corrected for photon attenuation by the use of a lateral transmission image acquired before the delivery of aerosols or powders. Marker images, obtained with a line source fixed to a balloon and kept for a short while against the palate as well as with a point source held on anatomical landmarks, were used to co-register the scintigraphic images to sagital sections through a three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR)-image series. The MR set was used to define the inner nose contour and the nasal regions used for quantification.
Data for 38 patients were analyzed retrospectively (27 males) with a mean age of 51+/-10 years. All patients underwent gated myocardial perfusion gated SPECT and two-dimensional echocardiography. EF estimated by the four methods and echocardiography were recorded and analyzed with paired t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, analysis of variance, and Bland-Altman plot.
All 31 lymphoma patients in whom the histologic diagnosis was made and who had also undergone a prechemotherapy PET scan at our institution between June 2001 and December 2005 were included in this retrospective study. The percentage of tumor cells in the various lymphoma subtypes was estimated by comparison of hematoxylin and eosin stain with a lineage-associated immunohistochemical stain on the same block of tissue. Tissue specimens were stained with Glut1 and Glut3 antibodies. The percentages of Glut1+ and Glut3+ cells in the entire cell population (lymphoma cells and nonlymphomatous cells) and among the lymphoma cells were estimated. FDG PET images were reviewed and the tumor intensity was assessed by calculating the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). Correlation coefficients between SUVmax and the percentage of Glut1+ and Glut3+ cells in the entire cell population were calculated.
Eleven men, categorized as either having a lower (LOW-FIT; n = 5) or higher (FIT; n = 6) aerobic fitness level, completed a 4-d baseline period (BL) of an energy balance diet while maintaining usual physical activity level, followed by a 7-d intervention consisting of 1,000 kcal¬∑d‚Åª¬π increased energy expenditure via exercise (50-65% VO‚ÇÇpeak). All volunteers consumed 0.9 g protein.kg‚Åª¬π¬∑d‚Åª¬π and total energy intake was adjusted to maintain energy balance throughout the 11-d study. Mean nitrogen balance (NBAL) was determined for BL, days 5-8 (EX1), and days 9-11 (EX2). Whole-body protein turnover was derived from phenylalanine and tyrosine kinetics assessed while fasting at rest on days 4, 7, and 12 using a priming dose of L-[ring-¬π‚ÅµN]tyrosine and a 4-h primed, continuous infusion of L-[¬π‚ÅµN]phenylalanine and L-[ring-¬≤H‚ÇÑ]tyrosine.

Data were collected for treatments, antibiotic sensitivity patterns, and final visual outcomes.
Concensus workshop of an international committee on nomenclature.
An international group of uveitis specialists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and America met in a concensus conference in Shinagawa, Tokyo on October 28-29, 2006. Based on questionnaires that had been sent out prior to the conference, the participants discussed potential intraocular clinical signs eligible for a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. A refined definition of clinical signs, which received two-thirds majority of votes, was included in the list of signs consistent with ocular sarcoidosis. Laboratory investigations were similarly discussed and those tests reaching a two-thirds majority were retained for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. Finally diagnostic criteria were proposed based on ocular signs, laboratory investigations, and biopsy results.
Retrospective, case history study. We reviewed the medical records of 46 patients who attended the sarcoidosis clinics at the Royal Brompton and Moorfields Eye Hospital over a 4-year period with a diagnosis of definite and probable neurosarcoidosis supported by laboratory investigations and exclusion of other causes for the neurological symptoms.

A search of the English, German, and Spanish language MEDLINE database was conducted. A total of 654 references spanning the period through early 2008 were individually evaluated.
A retrospective review was performed of consecutive patients treated with intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) for ME secondary to BRVO/HRVO from May 2005 to August 2006 with follow-up through February 2007. Re-treatment was performed at monthly or longer intervals at the discretion of the treating physician.
This was a consecutive, retrospective, and comparative cohort study. Patients undergoing vitrectomy from September 2006 through November 2007 at the Emory Eye Center for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy were identified and reviewed. A total of 33 eyes pretreated with bevacizumab and 104 untreated eyes were observed for postoperative vitreous hemorrhage and final visual acuity.
This was a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial in patients with CRVO or branch retinal vein occlusion, best-corrected visual acuity &lt; or =20/50, and onset of symptoms within 11 days before treatment. In each group, patients were randomized to either hemodilution or thrombolysis with 50 mg of rt-PA with concomitant intravenous heparinization. The primary clinical outcome measure was improvement in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline at 1 year.
A prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. Thirty-seven consecutive eyes with macular edema were included in the study. For all eyes, BCVA, central retinochoroidal thickness at standardized A-scan, central retinal thickness, and central retinal sensitivity recorded with a spectral scanning laser ophthalmoscope optical coherence tomography/microperimeter device were evaluated at baseline and 7, 15, 30, 37, 45, and 60 days after initial treatment. All patients received 2 intravitreal bevacizumab injections at 1-month interval.
In this pilot study, eight patients with RAP underwent indocyanine green angiography (ICGA)-guided single-session verteporfin PDT followed by intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) within a 0-day +/- 1-day interval. All patients were na√Øve to treatment. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography, ICGA, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed at baseline and at each follow-up visit. All patients received three consecutive monthly IVB injections; thereafter, retreatment with bevacizumab was performed in the case of worsening BCVA or a deterioration of angiographic or OCT findings.
Patients with a known history of glaucoma and those receiving triamcinolone acetonide were excluded from the study. Fundus photographs were cropped to optic disk images only, which were then randomized and independently graded by two glaucoma specialists. In patients who received treatments in only one eye, the fellow eye was used as a control.
The study population consisted of 26 AMD patients (26 eyes) with the exclusion criterion of prior treatment of the choroidal neovascular membranes. Factor P was detected immunocytochemically on paraffin sections (7 microm) by a polyclonal rabbit antihuman antibody.
Thirty-two eyes from 32 normal patients underwent complete ophthalmic evaluation. Macular scanning using the StratusOCT and the RTVue-100 OCT were performed for a total of three times each on the same visit. The average retinal thicknesses of the nine macular sectors as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, along with the foveal center point and macular volume, were recorded. The SD, the coefficient of variation, and the intraclass correlation coefficient were calculated for each parameter studied. Comparisons were made between the two OCTs in terms of retinal thicknesses measurements, their reproducibility, and macular regional differences. Correlations between retinal thickness and demographic variables (age and gender) were also investigated. Due to known differences in segmentation algorithms of the two OCTs, software calipers were used to measure the distance from the internal limiting membrane to the photoreceptor inner segment-outer segment junction at the foveal center point on all RTVue scans to allow a more fair comparison.
Eyes of patients with cuticular drusen were imaged using a prototype spectral domain optical coherence tomography instrument with 5-microm axial resolution. Thickness maps were obtained after automated segmentation of the internal limiting membrane and retinal pigment epithelium layers using a proprietary algorithm. The volume of subretinal fluid (SRF) was calculated using a manual segmentation technique that involved drawing boundaries around the SRF. The repeatability of these measurements was tested by comparing the volume measurements from multiple scans performed on the same day in four eyes of three patients.
This study is a retrospective analysis of data from patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with ranibizumab. Preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP) were performed before and within 10 days of treatment. Pre- and posttreatment PHP metamorphopsia maps of contours showing 6 levels of metamorphopsia severity (S1 through S6; least to most distortion) were analyzed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) outputs were subjected to standardized grading to generate metrics on subretinal fluid height, maximum retinal thickness, outer high-reflectivity band thickness, and height of pigment epithelial detachment (OCT metrics).
This was a retrospective consecutive case series. The Bascom Palmer Eye Institute Microbiology Laboratory database was reviewed to identify all patients with intraocular cultures positive for Proteus species between 1983 and 2007. Clinical records were reviewed to ascertain the clinical presentation, management, and visual acuity outcomes.
Twenty-four eyes of 13 patients with retinitis pigmentosa, aged 13 years to 67 years, were studied. The integrity of the photoreceptor cilia, also known as the inner/outer segment junction of the photoreceptors, the outer nuclear layer, and retinal pigment epithelium, was evaluated outside, across, and inside the ring with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).
This study used a retrospective review and a comparison of all patients newly referred from retinal Practice 1 (J.T.T., R.N.S.) for LV consultation, from July 2005 to June 2006 (Year 1, preranibizumab) and from July 2006 to June 2007 (Year 2, ranibizumab available), and a retrospective review of patients referred by retinal Practice 2 (M.J.E.) since February 2007.
Data from 445 patients diagnosed with PMC in the period from 1978 to 2003 were reviewed and analyzed. Total thyroidectomy was performed in 404 patients and loboisthmusectomy in 41. Neck dissection took place in 226 patients (49.7%), with 166 of only the central compartment and 60 of both the central and lateral compartments. Radioiodine ((131)I) ablation treatment was given to 389 patients.
Forty-two children (mean age, 14.75 years) underwent US-FNA of 52 thyroid nodules. The specificity, sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy, and unsatisfactory rates were compared to other similar studies.
We performed a retrospective multivariate logistic regression analysis of US features, clinicopathological data, and the latency period between radiation exposure and the diagnosis of cancer in 94 patients who were 10.6-34.3 years old (16.5 +/- 6.2, mean +/- standard deviation) at the time of diagnosis and 0.1-18.0 years old (5.6 +/- 4.2) at the time of the Chernobyl accident.
Published series of thyroid FNAB with &gt;200 FNAB and available histological data with sufficient raw data to recalculate statistics were analyzed. Considering indeterminate and malignant results to be positive FNAB results, since, in a four-tier system, both lead to surgical management, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, FN, and false-positive (FP) rates were recalculated. Differences between reported and recalculated statistics were then evaluated for significance.
Normal Fisher rat thyroid follicular cells (FRTL5 cells) and tumorigenic rat thyroid carcinoma cells (FRTL-Tc cells) derived from FRTL5 cells were employed. The cells were injected into thyroids or subcutaneously into left flanks of rats alone or in combination with skin-derived fibroblasts. In groups of rats, fibroblasts were irradiated with 0.1 or 4 Gy x-ray 3 days before inoculation. In vitro growth of FRTL-Tc and FRTL-5 cells were evaluated using the fibroblast-conditioned medium and in a co-culture system with fibroblasts.
The effects of intrinsic and extrinsic glucocorticoid on the D2 activity and mRNA in rat aorta media were studied using metyrapone, a corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, and dexamethasone (DEX). Further, the effects of DEX on D2 expression were studied using the cultured rat VSMCs.
During the last 34 years 852 follicular cell-derived DTC cases (83% papillary [PTC], 17% follicular [FTC] carcinoma) presented in the Endocrine Unit of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics in Alexandra Hospital (18.8% men, mean age 42.4 +/- 14.5 years). Patients were classified in three period groups according to year of diagnosis: period 1, 1963-1982; period 2, 1983-1992; and period 3, 1993-2007. We recorded the histological type, age at diagnosis, and, in period 3, the type of pre-existing thyroid disease, the stage, and tumor size.
This was a prospective, controlled, intervention study involving 67 subjects: 28 patients with major depression and hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine therapy randomized for treatment with fluoxetine (n = 13) or sertraline (n = 15); 29 patients with major depression and normal thyroid function treated with fluoxetine (n = 15) or sertraline (n = 14) and 10 control patients with hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine therapy without depression. Main outcome measures included thyrotropin, thyroxine (T(4)), free thyroxine, triiodothyronine (T(3)), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and Hamilton depression (HAM-D) rating scale.
Reference intervals were calculated for serum FT(4) (n = 1426) and FT(3) (n = 1107) obtained from healthy children between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2008, from Children's National Medical Center and Georgetown University Medical Center Bioanalytical Core Laboratory, Washington, DC. Serum samples were analyzed using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with deuterium-labeled internal standards.
TSHR mutations were characterized by determination of cell surface expression, cAMP accumulation, and linear regression analysis of constitutive activity.
We examined candidates listed in the United States from 1988 to 2007 from the Scientific Renal Transplant Registry (SRTR) database that were relisted after loss of a primary kidney transplant (n=15,980). The primary outcome was change in panel reactive antibody (PRA) from prior to recipient's initial transplant to the subsequent listing. Absolute change in PRA levels were examined in general linear models and the likelihood of becoming newly sensitized in logistic models.
Renal transplants were performed between major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-identical animals differing only in the source of their maternally derived cytoplasmic DNA, using a protocol, which uniformly leads to tolerance within standard MHC-inbred lines. In an attempt to correlate transplant results with a putative marker for disparities in cytoplasmically inherited minor histocompatibility antigens, we examined one hypervariable region of mtDNA, designated hypervariable region 1 (HV1).
Encapsulated cells were transplanted subcutaneously (n=2), or cells were injected without encapsulation (n=1) and outcomes compared. BLI was performed to monitor cell survival.
EC was induced by 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The HSCs, MSCs, HSCs+MSCs, derived from male Sprague-Dawley rats, were cultured and labeled with bromodeoxyuridine and then transplanted into the EC rat. The colon samples were collected for histologic evaluation at days 7, 14, and 21 posttransplantation. Immunohistochemical staining, polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to detect donor stem cells population.
Two hundred islets, the number of islets from a single mouse pancreas, were grafted into the liver of streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Adenosine was administered once at the time of islet transplantation. Mononuclear cells in the liver of mice receiving islets were isolated and examined by flow cytometry.
Demographic, anthropometrical, and laboratory data, as well as family history of type 2 DM (first degree relatives), were collected from 44 ITx recipients. Risk factors for type 2 DM, such as positive family history of type 2 DM (n=11) and overweight (body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2; n=14), were analyzed separately and in combination, which was designated as "type 2 DM phenotype" (n=5). Differences in outcomes (time-to-graft dysfunction and failure) were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression analysis was performed to control for possible confounding factors.
Twenty-five renal transplant patients were recruited and received TAC therapy, of which nine of these patients were treated with statin therapy for dyslipidemia. The effects of TAC on plasma total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, cholesterol ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase and LPL concentration and activity were determined from patients plasma samples collected before the transplant surgery (baseline), and weekly for four consecutive weeks after surgery and TAC administration.
In a prospective, multicenter, open-label study, deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients at protocol-specified risk of DGF (defined as &gt; or =1 dialysis session during the first week posttransplant excluding day 1) were randomized to start everolimus therapy on day 1 posttransplant (immediate everolimus [IE]), or from week 5 (delayed everolimus [DE]) with mycophenolic acid until everolimus was initiated. All patients received anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies, cyclosporine A, and corticosteroids. A planned 3-month analysis from this 12-month study is presented here.
We examined patient and allograft survival according to donor and recipient CMV serostatus in 10,190 UK adult and pediatric deceased donor renal transplant recipients transplanted between 2000 and 2007. We also ascertained CMV prophylaxis strategies in all UK renal transplant units.
In this case-control study, we examined the association of tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone with BKN in renal allograft recipients transplanted between 1997 and 2004 at our center who underwent biopsies for allograft dysfunction. Drug levels or doses were recorded during the 3 months before the index biopsy. Random effects logistic modeling was used for data analysis.
Total of 4128 urine and serum samples obtained from renal transplant patients were analyzed for BKV positivity by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 433 patients in cross-sectional and in 233 patients in longitudinal manner, respectively. The prospective longitudinal analysis included seven measurements during the first posttransplant year.
A cross-sectional study of 12, 401 prevalent adult dialysis patients from 41 renal units across England and Wales was performed. The proportion of patients registered on the deceased donor transplant waiting list was determined for each renal unit. Patient- and center-specific factors that influence the probability of being listed for transplantation were identified and used to adjust for differences observed between units. The annual change in the size of the transplant waiting list was examined before and after presentation of these data.
Specific variables significantly associated with listing were age, primary renal disease, graft number, social deprivation, and ethnicity but not gender. Centre-specific variables included size of renal unit, size of living donor program, and listing practice for living donor transplantation. Whether the renal unit was also a transplant unit was not significant. After adjusting for these variables, there remained unexplained variation between renal units in the proportion of dialysis patients on the waiting list. An increase in the number of patients listed for transplantation has been observed since presenting these data.
We evaluated 678 liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) obtained in the peritransplantation period from 24 LDLT recipients, 24 corresponding donors (preoperatively only), another five donors with a remnant right liver, and three deceased donor liver transplantation recipients. The LSM was performed once preoperatively, every morning postoperatively until postoperative day 14, and three times a week after that until the patient was discharged from the hospital.
By using a uniform comprehensive medical record review process, data were collected on 3565 living liver donors who had donated grafts by the end of December 2006 at 38 Japanese centers.
In a 12-month multicenter open-label study, cardiac transplant patients received everolimus (trough level 3-8 ng/mL) with reduced cyclosporine A (CsA) or MMF (3 g/day) with standard CsA, both with corticosteroids+/-induction therapy.
Thirty-five asymptomatic pediatric thoracic Tx patients were categorized into three groups according to their EBV load levels as follows: undetectable viral load (UVL), chronic low viral load (LVL) and chronic high viral load (HVL). Global and EBV-specific T-cell immunity were assessed by ATP release using Cylex Immuknow and T Cell Memory assays.
A 7-year prospective cohort study assessed nonadherence longitudinally using electronic spirometry for 24 months. During follow-up, BOS, retransplantation, and survival were stratified by adherence groups.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32,757 Medicare primary transplant recipients in the United States Renal Data System from January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2004. PCP infection was defined by Medicare claims using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision codes. The incidence of PCP infections, graft loss, and death were measured.
Articles were selected through a probability sample of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and NEJM during odd numbered months of 1994, 1999, and 2004. RCTs were independently reviewed and coded by two abstractors, with adjudication by a third. Studies were classified as reporting: (1) HTE analysis, utilizing a formal test for heterogeneity or treatment-by-covariate interaction, (2) subgroup analysis only, involving no formal test for heterogeneity or interaction; or (3) neither. Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with HTE reporting.
Children ages 12-60 months who received a first dose of MMRV in February 2006-June 2007 in a managed care organization were included in the study. Subjects were optimally matched on age, sex, and calendar date of vaccination to children who received MMR+V concomitantly in November 2003-January 2006, before MMRV licensure. Potential cases of febrile convulsion were identified through administrative data and adjudicated by expert panel, according to pre-specified criteria.
Seventy patients with essential hypertension of grade 2 or grade 3 were randomly assigned to routine group and SXC group. There were 35 cases in each group. The patients in the routine group were administered with 2.5 mg levoamlodipine and 40 mg telmisartan once daily, and 1.5 g SXC was administered orally to the patients in the SXC group three times daily besides levoamlodipine and telmisartan treatment. They were all treated for two weeks. Twenty-four-hour ABPM, trough to peak ratio and smoothness index were measured before and after the treatment.
Fifty patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer were randomly divided into control group and Xuesaitong group, with 25 patients in each group. Conventional anti-infection and transfusion treatment was given to the patients in the control group, and intravenous drip infusion of 400 mg Xuesaitong Injection added into 250 mL 5% glucose injection was administered once daily to the patients in the Xuesaitong group for 6 days from the first day after laparoscopic operation besides the conventional anti-infection and transfusion treatment. The values of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB) and international normalized ratio (INR) were detected by using blood coagulation method, and the values of D-dimer (D-D) before operation, instantly and 3, 5, 7 days after operation were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the two groups. Furthermore, the development of deep vein thrombosis on the day 7 after operation was observed by vein angiography.
The outpatients and inpatients with lower limb arteriosclerosis from Shanghai Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine were randomly divided into control group and treatment group after color Doppler ultrasound inspection, and there were 30 cases in each group. The patients in the treatment group were treated with simvastatin and a Chinese compound herbal medicine for reinforcing qi, activating blood circulation, expelling phlegm and dredging collaterals, and the patients in the control group were treated only with simvastatin. The color Doppler ultrasound imaging of lower limb arteries including inside diameter, intima-media thickness, and plaque area in all the patients were examined after 6-month treatment. The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were detected too.
A total of 1 582 outpatients with menopause syndrome who met with the diagnosis and inclusion criteria in seven grade 3 hospitals from October 2006 to June 2007 were included. A clinical epidemiological survey in the patients was carried out. The syndrome elements of disease location and characteristics were extracted and analyzed statistically by standardizing the syndrome differentiation of experts' experience in traditional Chinese medicine.
Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly divided into SJ5 group and SJ5 plus GB34 group, and there were 8 volunteers in each group. The volunteers in the two groups received needling at corresponding points on the right hand or foot respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1.5T, GE Corporation) was used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain before and during the needling, and the obtained experimental data in the regional brain were processed and analyzed by the method of region of interest (ROI).
The L4-larvae were cultured with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of BKT with the final concentration of 0.33 g/mL. Ultraviolet irradiation [20 J/(m(2) x min)], heat-shock (36 degrees centigrade, 2 h), and paraquat treatment (2 mmol/L, 2h) were exerted as the stresses. Reproduction was assayed by the egg number in uterus, brood size, and generation time.
The mouse model of acute inflammation with increase of capillary permeability was induced by intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid. An orthogonal design with 2 levels (used and unused) was applied to assign the combinations groups of active ingredients including naringin and neohesperidin, peoniflorin, and platycodin. Aspirin and normal saline were administered as control. The pharmacodynamic interactions were analyzed by the optical density (OD) of infiltrated Evans blue.
Forty Wistar male rats were used to establish the NAFLD model by subcutaneous injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) for 4 weeks (twice weekly) along with high-fat and low-protein diet for 2 weeks. After two-week administration, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: untreated group, high-dose QSHYD group, medium-dose QSHYD group and low-dose QSHYD group. Another six rats were used as normal control. After 2-week treatment, the following indexes were detected: (1) liver pathology; (2) contents of serum adiponectin (ADP) and liver triglyceride (TG); (3) concentrations of liver FFA, adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), malonyl-coenzyme A (malony1-CoA), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1).
(1) Sixty mice were randomly divided into Liangxue Jiedu Decoction group, compound Indigo Naturalis capsule group, acitretin capsule group and normal saline group. Another 10 mice were selected as blank control. After 2-week administration, mice were sacrificed to obtain samples. After hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, tail scales with granular layers were calculated by an optical microscope. (2) Except for ten mice in blank group, sixty female mice were injected intraperitoneally with diethylstilbestrol once daily. After 3-day injection, mice were randomly divided into four groups and treated as above description. After 2-week treatment, all mice were injected intraperitoneally with colchicine (2 mg/kg), and sacrificed 6 h after the injection. The mitotic rate in virginal epithelium was calculated after HE staining.
Sixty SD rats were divided into 3 groups: sham-operated group, untreated group and catechin group. Animal model was reproduced by 5/6 nephrectomy. After 8- and 12-week administration, rats were sacrificed. Renal MVD was measured by immunohistochemical method with CD34 marking. Activities of ACE in plasma and renal cortices were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer, and Ang II contents in plasma and renal cortices were measured by radioimmunoassay. Glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) and tubule interstitial score (TIS) were calculated by semiquantitative integration with hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining.
The stereo localization technique and push-and-pull perfusion of the rat brain nucleus were adopted for collecting the hypothalamic MPOA perfusate of the female rats with normal sexual cycle, and also for collecting the MPOA perfusate of ovariectomized rats after electro-acupuncture treatment as acupuncture perfusate (AP). After being respectively microinjected into MPOA of the ovariectomized rats, the influence of the different perfusates on vagina cytology and serum estradiol (E2) level was observed. The contents of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), dopamine (DA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), aspartate (Asp) and beta-endorphin (beta-EP) in the perfusate of each group were detected by radioimmunoassay or high performance liquid chromatography, and then the varieties and contents of these substances in the perfusate of each group were compared and analyzed.
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIB, cortical tuberous sclerosis (TSC) lesions, gangliogliomas, grey matter heterotopias and hemimegalencephaly from a wide age range of patients using both surgical and post mortem tissue specimens were studied.
We performed a retrospective review of 44 patients who had laparoscopic Hartmann's reversal (Group A). On a case-control basis, these patients were compared to 44 patients (Group B) who had open Hartmann's reversal.
To determine during which BB stage and how frequently the DR is affected by AD-related neurofibrillary changes, we studied the DR of 118 well-characterized individuals of the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group categorized according to the BB. Thirty-eight of these individuals were staged as BB = 0, and 80 as BB &gt;or= 1.
Bereaved (n= 62) and non-bereaved individuals (n= 50) were evaluated within 2 weeks and at 6 months following loss using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies -- Depression, Spielberger State Anxiety and Anger, Social Support Questionnaire and changes in appetite, cigarette and alcohol consumption, cortisol and lipids.
The NZMHS is a nationally representative face-to-face household survey, carried out in 2003-2004 with a response rate of 73.3%. It surveyed 12,992 New Zealand adults aged 16 and over Pacific people were over sampled This paper focuses on the 2374 Pacific participants but includes for comparison 8160 non-Maori-non-Pacific participants (Others).
Multiple logistic regression models were used to produce estimates weighted to account for diferent probabilities of selection and taking account of the complex survey design.
A fixed comparative non-experimental design was utilised where participants were selected using direct control based on their self-identified ethnic group resulting in sub-samples of 11 Maori, 11 Pacific and 11 Pakeha (n=33). Each participant completed the Neurobehavioural Cognitive Status Examination (Cognistat) and the Brain Injury Community Rehabilitation Outcome Scales (BICRO-39 Scales).
At the 12-month measurement point, mothers (N=1207) were interviewed about their parenting practices using a modified version of the Parent Behaviour Checklist.
The DHAHS was a cross-sectional population based study of people age 35-74 years carried out in Auckland between 2002-03. A total of 1011 Pacific people comprising of 484 Samoan, 252 Tongan, 109 Niuean, 116 Cook Islanders and 47 'Other Pacific' (mainly Fijian) and 1745 European participants took part in the survey Participants answered a self-administered questionnaire to assess whether they consumed alcohol, their drinking patterns and consumption levels and reasons for stopping drinking.
(A) The New Zealand Mental Health Survey (NZMHS) is a nationally representative face-to-face household survey, carried out in 2003-2004. It surveyed 12,992 New Zealand adults aged 16 or more including 2374 Pacflc peoples (500 Cook Islands Maori) and 2457 New Zealand Maori. (B) An extract from the Mental Health Information National Collection (MHINC). This is a national dataset that is reported to by mental health services around New Zealand.
Multiple logistic regression models are used to produce estimates from both sets of data. In the case of A) the NZMHS the results are weighted to account for different probabilities of selection and analysis takes account of the complex survey design.
The study used qualitative methods, specifically individual interviews were conducted in Tongan or English. Participants were recruited through community networks in Auckland. A number of Tongan churches, Tongan medical clinics such as Langimailie, and kava clubs were approached to recruit participants. The open ended interview schedule covered themes such as access, quantity, frequency, and problems associated with kava use. The interviews were conducted by a Tongan researcher either in English or Tongan. All interviews were translated and transcribed into English. A thematic analysis based on multiple readings of the transcripts was used The analysis identified commonalities and differences. The study was granted ethical approval by the University of Auckland Human Subjects Ethics Committee in December 2004. Interviews were conducted at the beginning of 2005. Interviews were undertaken in a place where the participants felt comfortable. Interview times were arranged at a time convenient for the participants. All participants were given information sheets prior to interviews, and participants were asked to sign consent forms before the interviews commenced. These forms were provided in Tongan and English versions. Most of the interviews ranged between one to three hours. Interviews were audiotaped, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the research.
Twelve men were interviewed. All participants were Tongan men born and raised in Tonga. The ages of men ranged between 30 and 75 years. Most of the men had been residing in New Zealand for over 30 years, although some men had only been in New Zealand between 2-18 years. Most of the men were employed and a few had retired from work. Most of these men also belonged to a church. All of the men who participated were married.
A qualitative research methodology offace to face interviews was used to interview NZ born Niuean women and their alcohol consumption. Participants were recruited by using a snow ball methodology. Participants were also approached throughout the community on the telephone and via email/internet about the research. Participants were also from Niuean gatherings such as Niuean cultural workshops, weaving groups, church groups, and sports groups, Niuean websites. A semi-structured interview format was used making it more informal and comfortable for the participant by using open ended questions. These questions include first drinking experiences, reasons for drinking, drinking styles, drinking venues and environments, times to drink, risky behaviours and attitudes, pregnancy and sexual behaviours. The interviews ranged from 1-2 hours. Ethical approval for the research was obtained from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee in June 2004. Interviews were done in Niuean or English optional for the participants in the study. An important feature of the research process and cultural appropriateness is that I am New Zealand born but was raised in Niue Island as a young child. I am fluent in both English and Niuean languages. My Niuean cultural back ground and knowledge will be beneficial in the formulation of ideas and interpretations in the interview discussions and research data analysis. The researcher will interpret the cultural knowledge and understanding throughout the discussions which will be useful when gathering and analysing empirical information gathered from the research.
There were nine New Zealand born Niuean women aged between 18-45yrs plus living in Auckland who participated. Two of the participants are half palagi (European) and half Niuean. This is a reflection of the young population that many Niuean women today are born into in New Zealand, as the majority of Niues population is New Zealand born. The NZ born young women views were highlighted in this study because of the growing population of Niue communities in Auckland, New Zealand. The participants were from diverse backgrounds, from professional career minded women, beneficiaries, single, married, mothers, solo parent, tertiary students.
We performed a randomized simulation study to compare two systems of cardiac arrest response: public access AED vs. standard manual defibrillation. The study was conducted in two phases at two different settings: (1) in a contiguous United States (CONUS)-based training combat support hospital (CSH) and (2) at a deployed CSH within a combat forward operating base (FOB). The primary outcome was t(defib) and the secondary outcome was difficulty of use.
the Iranian Veterans Administration of the Khorasan province invited their Iranian military amputees from the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) to its medical center for evaluation. The patients filled out a detailed questionnaire and were interviewed and examined by each team member.
We performed a retrospective study involving the whole medical evacuations out of a theater of operations to the benefit of the French Armed forces, for a suspected diagnosis of ACS.
Twenty eight subjects with MDH referred to our Allergy/Immunology Unit were enrolled from May 2006 to May 2007. Eight healthy subjects served as controls. In addition to common diagnostic tools used in the diagnostic algorithm of MDH, enrolled subjects also underwent ASST and APST.
PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 exposures were measured by means of pre-calibrated portable laser-operated particle analyzers. PM10 data from the ARPA official monitoring stations were also evaluated.
a small-area epidemiological study based on descriptive statistics, socioeconomic deprivation variables, analysis of spatial heterogeneity disease mapping and time trend analysis was carried out.
age-standardised rate, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), SMRs adjusted by socioeconomic deprivation, spatial heterogeneity test results, empirical and hierarchical Bayesian estimators, and temporal trends of selected causes are shown.
Italy, Taranto province (581,508 inhabitants).
incidence data in 29 municipalities of the Taranto province were extracted from the Jonico Salentino Cancer Registry (RTJS) for the following cancer sites: lung (ICDX C33-C34); pleura, pleuric mesothelioma (ICDX C45.0); bladder, malignancies only (ICDX C67); brain (ICDX C70-72); non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ICDX C82-85, C96); leukaemia (ICDX C91-5). Age standardized incidence rates for the whole province were computed. High-level risk areas were classified using a Poisson model, computing area-specific p-values associated to the null hypothesis of no increased risk (i.e. relative risk equal to 1). A hierarchical spatial Bayesian model was estimated to strengthen results: specifically two additional variance components, accounting for relative risk spatial autocorrelation and excess heterogeneity respectively, were considered in the model specification. Bayesian mapping of disease incidence allows for the drawing of regularized (smoothed) maps. To adjust for the effect of socio-economic deprivation, a five-variable index was introduced into the model as an ecological covariate.
cross sectional study in the framework of a survey of children using a self-administered questionnaire.
35412 children attending primary schools in the provinces of Latina and Rome, located in the Lazio region (Italy), in the 1998-2001 time period.

Retrospective review of 2207 patients with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage I, II or III (local or regional disease) patients eligible for surgery, nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed and treated in WV between 1993 and 2000, which underwent surgery as a first course of treatment. Data set obtained from the West Virginia Cancer Registry.
The clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment and clinical course of HCC is described for both patients. Relevant family history is discussed. This is followed by a review of literature regarding genetic basis of familial and sporadic HCC.
Three experimental groups were used. Group one was obturated with GP using lateral condensation, group two with GP using vertical condensation and group three using GuttaFlow and a single GP cone. Bacterial micro-leakage was tested using the two-chamber method, followed by dye penetration testing. Data was subjected to statistical analysis using the Chi Square test.
Two main groups of PMMA resin, 1 unreinforced and 1 reinforced with glass fibre, had 3 subgroups (n=21) each representing a different P/L ratio. The manufacturer's recommended ratio served as control. The specimens were prepared for a 3-point bending test. Using a universal testing machine, maximum force was recorded and the FS was calculated. Median FS values were compared by means of non-parametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
We analyzed survey data collected at baseline from 855 women (&gt;40 years old) in women's health clinics, who were recruited for a risk-tailored intervention. Screening practices, health behaviors, and demographics were surveyed. Statistical analyses were performed using bivariate difference tests and multiple logistic regression.
A review of the recent literature on the subject of CVD in women over the past several years was conducted with a focus on CVD in African American women. Statistical data on incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality of CAD, hypertension, stroke, and CHF in black and white women were compared.
A cross-sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 1049 women aged 18 or older, of whom 37.94% reported never having been screened for cervical cancer, 23.55% reported noncompliance, and 38.51% were in compliance with screening guidelines. The sample was comprised of Chinese, 50.58%; Koreans, 17.50%; Vietnamese, 16.15%; and Cambodians, 15.77%.
A total of 257 patients were enrolled in the randomized study, with a loss-to-follow-up rate of 9.73%. Patients were assigned randomly to either the control (unmonitored) group (n=116), consisting of conventional prenatal dietary management, or to the study (monitored) group (n=116), which was prescribed a balanced nutritional regimen and were asked to record in a diary all of the foods eaten during each day. Women were eligible for the study if they were pregnant with a single fetus between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation and had a prepregnancy body mass index of more than 30 kg/m2. The primary outcome was to compare perinatal outcomes in the control vs the study groups. The secondary measure was to compare outcomes in adherent and nonadherent patients in the study group.
A review of all cases of cesarean section that were done in the maternity unit at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, Nigeria, between January 2006 and April 2007, with emphasis on indications and perinatal outcome.
We conducted analysis on the Missouri maternally linked data files covering the period 1989-1997 inclusive. Using body mass index (BMI), we categorized mothers as underweight (BMI &lt;18.5) and normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9). By applying logistic regression modeling with adjustment for intracluster correlation, we estimated the risk for total, early (-28 weeks of gestation), and late stillbirth (&gt;28 weeks of gestation) among black and white mothers.

A 17-year-old girl presented with a large asymptomatic pelvic mass, which was clinically suspected to be a leiomyoma. An initial sonographic study was questionable for a myoma but was confirmed on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A large myoma was noted and removed at surgery. The patient subsequently became pregnant and delivered at term by caesarean section.
We conducted a simulation skills lab for neonatal chest tube placement using a fryer chicken model. Thirty incoming pediatric interns were prospectively queried on comfort levels of inserting chest tubes prior to and following the simulation lab.
A nonrandomized, within-subject design was implemented to investigate vowel and consonant recognition and fricative articulation of school-age children utilizing this feature.
Ten children, aged 6 years and 3 months, to 13 years and 6 months from a special education school district participated in this study. Individual hearing thresholds ranged from normal to moderate in the low frequencies and from severe to profound in the high frequencies. Average language age of children was within 2.2 years of chronological age.
Phoneme recognition and fricative articulation performance were compared for three conditions: (1) with the children's own hearing aids, (2) with an advanced hearing instrument utilizing LFT, and (3) with the same instrument without LFT. Nonsense syllable materials were administered at 30 and 50 dB HL input levels. Fricative articulation was measured by analyzing speech samples of conversational speech and oral reading passages. Repeated measures general linear model was utilized to determine the significance of any noted effects.

Sampling was performed at a point of a mean 2.9 years postsurgery (SD = 1.8 years). Three established self-report questionnaires were included measuring tinnitus handicap (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI]), hearing problems (Gothenburg Profile), and finally, a measure of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). We analyzed the data by means of Pearson product moment correlations, t-tests, ANOVAs, and chi-square.
Sixty new hearing aid users were fitted binaurally with Beltone Oria behind-the-ear digital hearing aids. Forty participants received prefitting counseling and demonstration of listening situations with the Beltone AVE (Audio Verification Environment) system; 20 received prefitting counseling without a demonstration of listening situations. Hearing aid expectations were measured at initial contact and following prefitting counseling. Reported hearing aid outcome was measured after eight to ten weeks of hearing aid use.
Sixty new hearing aid users aged between 55 and 81 years with symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups, between which the prefitting counseling and follow-up differed: Group 1 received prefitting counseling in combination with demonstration of listening situations. Additionally, if the participant had complaints about sound quality at the follow-up visit, the hearing aids were fine-tuned using the Beltone AVE system. Group 2 received prefitting counseling in combination with demonstration of listening situations with the Beltone AVE system, but no fine-tuning was provided at follow-up. Group 3 received prefitting hearing aid counseling that did not include demonstration of listening, and the hearing aids were not fine-tuned at the follow-up appointment.
In total, 112 patients of the Occupational Diseases Outpatient Clinic and the Occupational and Environmental Allergy Centre of the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine (NIOM) were examined. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to assess the patients' mental health; a Polish version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was employed to assess life quality; and the Self-Acceptance Scale (SAS) served to obtain the patients' self-image. Results showed that there were statistically significant differences in self-assessment of mental health and quality of life depending on ones's level of self-acceptance. People with high self-acceptance are characterized by better mental health than those with low self-acceptance (t = 4.8; p = 0.00). Patients with a negative selfimage (compared to those with a positive self-image) also deem their quality of life to be poor (t = 3.1; p = 0.00). Results of regression analysis show that mental health status significantly affects the quality of life in dermatology patients; the standardized coefficient was beta = 0.42 (p &lt; 0.0001).

The Modified Impact Index (MII) was defined as the ratio of the observed h-index (h) of an institution over the h-index anticipated for that institution on average, given the number of publications (N) it produces i.e. MII = h/10alphaNbeta (alpha and beta denote the intercept and the slope, respectively, of the line describing the dependence of the h-index on the number of publications in log10 scale). MII values higher than 1 indicate that an institution performs better than the average, in terms of its h-index. Data on scientific papers published during 2002-2006 and within 36 medical fields for 219 Academic Medical Institutions from 16 European countries were used to estimate alpha and beta and to calculate the MII of their total and field-specific production.
A randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design will evaluate the clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and recurrence rates of adding physiotherapy to an injection. In addition, the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of corticosteroid injection beyond that of a placebo saline injection will be studied. 132 participants with a diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia will be randomly assigned by concealed allocation to one of four treatment groups - corticosteroid injection, saline injection, corticosteroid injection with physiotherapy or saline injection with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy will comprise 8 sessions of elbow manipulation and exercise over an 8 week period. Blinded follow-up assessments will be conducted at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after randomisation.

Evaluation of dermal and epidermal protein expression of LL-37 and the degree of inflammation was performed by immunohistochemical stainings.
Ex vivo human skin specimens obtained from six patients aged from 10 to 50 years old who were undergoing skin plastic surgery were examined. Five patients had hypertrophic scar lesions and one patient had no scar lesion before we obtained his skin specimen. A total of 30 tissue section samples of 30 mum thickness were analysed by the use of a nonlinear spectral imaging system consisting of a femtosecond excitation light source, a high-throughput scanning inverted microscope, and a spectral imaging detection system. The high-contrast and high-resolution second harmonic generation (SHG) images of collagen and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) images of elastin fibres in hypertrophic scar tissues and normal skin were acquired using the extracting channel tool of the system. The emission spectra were analysed using the image-guided spectral analysis method. The depth-dependent decay constant of the SHG signal and the image texture characteristics of hypertrophic scar tissue and normal skin were used to quantitatively assess the amount, distribution and orientation of their collagen and elastin components.

With use of the random effects model, we calculated the summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for H. pylori infection according to history of breast-feeding.
An observational epidemiologic study was conducted in Johannesburg, South Africa. Initial and sustained virologic response to NNRTI-based therapy was compared between 94 HIV-infected women who had received sdNVP 18-36 months earlier and 60 unexposed, HIV-infected women who had been pregnant 12-36 months earlier. Viral load was measured every 4 weeks up to week 24 and then every 12 weeks up to week 78. Time to viral suppression (viral load, &lt;50 copies/mL) and confirmed rebound in the viral load (viral load, &gt;400 copies/mL) were compared. Drug resistance was assessed using K103N allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and population sequencing.
We examined the prevalence of rifampin resistance among 470 C. difficile isolates (51.1% during 2001-2002 and 48.9% during 2005) from a large teaching hospital. Rifampin sensitivity was performed using E-test. The epidemic BI/NAP1 C. difficile clone was identified by tcdC genotyping and multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis. A 200-base pair fragment of the rpoB gene was sequenced for 102 isolates. Data on rifamycin exposures were obtained for all patients.
We analyzed 2102 episodes of CAP in consecutively hospitalized patients over a 7-year period. The predictive rule consists of at least 1 of 2 major severity criteria (septic shock and invasive mechanical ventilation) or at least 3 of 9 minor severity criteria. We assessed the association of the predictive rule with ICU admission and mortality.
Twenty-three patients were studied as part of an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study of ARV therapy for HIV-2 infection in Senegal. Patients were treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)- and PI (indinavir)-based regimens. HIV-2 pol genes from these patients were genotyped, and the mutations predictive of resistance in HIV-2 were assessed. Correlates of ARV resistance were analyzed.
Children (age, 6 months to 15 years) who had been hospitalized with acute febrile encephalopathy (a &lt; or =2-week history of fever plus altered sensorium) were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus with commercial immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Children with positive results were randomized to receive either ribavirin (10 mg/kg per day in 4 divided doses for 7 days) or placebo syrup through nasogastric tube or by mouth. The primary outcome was early mortality; secondary outcome measures were early (at hospital discharge; normal or nearly normal, independent functioning, dependent, vegetative state, or death) outcome, time to resolution of fever, time to resumption of oral feeding, duration of hospitalization, and late outcome (&gt; or =3 months after hospital discharge). The study was double-blind, and analysis was by intention to treat.
One hundred two donor-recipient orthotopic liver transplantation pairs were studied. Five polymorphisms in the promoter and coding regions of MBL2 were examined. MBL levels were measured, using the mannan-binding and C4-deposition assays, in serum samples obtained before and after transplantation. Associations between MBL status, as assessed by serum MBL levels and MBL2 genotype, and time to first clinically significant infection (CSI) after transplantation were examined in survival analysis with consideration of competing risks.
We compared the distribution of one class of mobile elements--integrons and gene cassettes--among uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates from human diarrhea cases, and E. coli and Salmonella isolates from nonhuman sources in the United States. The sequences of the gene cassettes were also compared with those deposited in GenBank.
Public Health-Seattle &amp; King County offered HIV antibody testing to men who have sex with men (MSM) using the OraQuick Advance Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test (OraQuick; OraSure Technologies) on oral fluid or finger-stick blood specimens or using a first- or second-generation enzyme immunoassay. The enzyme immunoassay was also used to confirm reactive rapid test results and to screen specimens from OraQuick-negative MSM prior to pooling for HIV NAAT. Serum specimens obtained from subsets of HIV-infected persons were retrospectively evaluated by use of other HIV tests, including a fourth-generation antigen-antibody combination assay.
This was a retrospective inception cohort study of outpatients with a new prescription for gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin from 1 October 2000 through 30 September 2005 in the Veterans Affairs health care system. For patients who received one of these antibiotics, we identified outcomes of hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of hypo- or hyperglycemia. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds of hypo- and hyperglycemia with the individual fluoroquinolones versus azithromycin.
We examined 3068 consecutive children admitted to a Kenyan district hospital with clinical features of severe malaria and 592 control subjects from the community. We performed multivariable regression analysis, with each case weighted for its probability of being due to falciparum malaria, using estimates of the fraction of severe disease attributable to malaria at different parasite densities derived from cross-sectional parasitological surveys of healthy children from the same community.
Sentinel sites included a metropolitan health maintenance organization laboratory and a hospital laboratory serving a small city and rural area. We received sorbitol-MacConkey agar plates from every stool culture performed at both sites during 2000-2006. Colony sweeps were screened for stx1 and stx2 by polymerase chain reaction. E. coli identity, serotype, and presence of stx1 and/or stx2 were confirmed on individual isolates.
We systematically reviewed literature on complicated SSSI published during 1900-1950 (before widespread penicillin resistance) to define treatment outcomes and confidence intervals (CIs). Antimicrobial efficacy was calculated as the lower limit CI of the cure rate with antimicrobials minus the upper limit CI of the cure rate without antimicrobials.
Derivation and internal validation cohorts were obtained by retrospective analysis of a database that included 3116 consecutive patients with community-acquired pneumonia from 2 university hospitals. Potential predictive factors were determined by means of a multivariate logistic regression equation applied to a cohort consisting of 60% of the patients. Points were assigned to significant parameters to generate the score. It was then internally validated with the remaining 40% of patients and was externally validated using an independent multicenter cohort of 1369 patients.
To determine cause of death, a postmortem examination was conducted, and friends and colleagues were interviewed. Physical evidence was reviewed, including specimens from the mountain lion and the biologist's medical chart, camera, and computer. Human and animal tissues were submitted for testing. Persons in close contact (within 2 meters) to the biologist after he had developed symptoms were identified and offered chemoprophylaxis.
All adult patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia for 7 days from January 2006 through March 2008 who were treated at Seoul National University Hospital were studied. The results of linezolid salvage therapy with or without carbapenem were compared with those of salvage therapy with vancomycin plus aminoglycosides or rifampicin.
Adult patients in western Kenya had their viral loads (VLs) determined if they had adhered to first-line therapy for &gt;6 months and were suspected of experiencing immunological failure (ie, their CD4 cell count decreased by 25% in 6 months). Misclassification of treatment failure was defined as a 25% decrease in CD4 cell count with a VL of &lt;400 copies/mL. Logistic and tree regressions examined relationships between VL and 4 variables: CD4 T cell count (hereafter CD4 cell count), percentage of T cells expressing CD4 (hereafter CD4 cell percentage), percentage decrease in the CD4 T cell count (hereafter CD4 cell count percent decrease), and percentage decrease in the percentage of T cells expressing CD4 (hereafter CD4% percent decrease).
In addition to longitudinal clinical parameters, virus-specific T cell responses were assessed using Elispot, standard proliferative (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester), and in vitro CD4(+) T cell assays.
An index case involving a young female with an amebic liver abscess led to an epidemiological investigation of sexual contacts. Anti-amebic serological analysis, stool specimen examinations, and abdominal ultrasounds were done for the contacts. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was done for stool antigen specific to E. histolytica. Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis was performed on 1 stool isolate.
We conducted a prospective study in a French hospital. All pregnant women giving birth at the maternity ward were considered for inclusion, except those with planned cesarean delivery, with delivery at &lt;35 weeks gestation, and who received antibiotic therapy before admission. We performed GBS culture (the reference standard) and a molecular GBS test (Xpert GBS; Cepheid) on intrapartum specimens. Decisions about intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis were based on the current GBS screening by culture at 35-37 weeks gestation.
Contacts of the patients with GAS infection were screened using questionnaires and testing of pharyngeal specimens. Specimens from patients and carriers of GAS who were identified during screening were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and emm gene typing.
The families of children from the United Kingdom who developed invasive Hib disease after prior immunization with Hib conjugate vaccine (i.e., Hib vaccine failure) from October 1992 through December 2005 were asked to complete a questionnaire. A blood sample was also obtained from each child.
Between November 2006 and January 2008 14 consecutive patients with typical muscarinic syndrome after mushroom ingestion were recorded. The clinical manifestations included combinations of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypersalivation, diaphoresis, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, lacrimation, blurred vision, miosis, tremor, restlessness, flushing, and syncope. Time to onset of toxicity ranged between 15 min and 2 h after consumption, 5 h in one patient. Treatment was supportive, including intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and 1 mg atropine intravenously. Full recovery ensued within 12 h. In all the cases, an expert mycologist unequivocally identified the leftovers of the consumed mushrooms as Inocybe fastigiata, Inocybe geophylla, and Inocybe patouillardii.
Medical records of infants treated with clonidine for NAS from January 2003 to March 2006 were reviewed for gestational age, birth weight, NAS score, dose of clonidine, duration of treatment, and additional medications required.
Eighty male CF-1 mice were randomly assigned to olanzapine (1 mg/kg) or placebo pretreatment. Fifteen minutes later, all animals received 103 mg/kg intraperitoneal cocaine.
A literature review was conducted and commentary written on the impact of the change in the United Kingdom on a variety of indices of paracetamol overdose.
For this analysis, a two-step approach was used to analyze potential heroin-related calls. First, the data were analyzed retrospectively to identify whether any significant temporal shifts occurred, then a prospective analysis was conducted to simulate real-time surveillance.
A systematic review of Medline, PubMed, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar using the search terms "cannabis," "marijuana," "marihuana," "toxicity," "complications," and "mechanisms" identified 5,198 papers. This list was screened by hand, and papers describing mechanisms and those published in more recent years were chosen preferentially for inclusion in this review.
A summary of the literature on DEG was compiled by systematically searching OVID MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science. Further information was obtained from book chapters, relevant news reports, and web material.
Following ingestion, DEG is rapidly absorbed and distributed within the body, predominantly to regions that are well perfused. Metabolism occurs principally in the liver and both the parent and the metabolite, 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), are renally eliminated rapidly.
The clinical effects of DEG poisoning can be divided into three stages: The first phase consists of gastrointestinal symptoms with evidence of inebriation and developing metabolic acidosis. If poisoning is pronounced, patients can progress to a second phase with more severe metabolic acidosis and evidence of emerging renal injury, which, in the absence of appropriate supportive care, can lead to death. If patients are stabilized, they may then enter the final phase with various delayed neuropathies and other neurological effects, sometimes fatal. TOXICITY OF DEG: Doses of DEG necessary to cause human morbidity and mortality are not well established. They are based predominantly on reports following some epidemics of mass poisonings, which may underestimate toxicity. The mean estimated fatal dose in an adult has been defined as approximately 1 mL/kg of pure DEG.
Eighteen structurally different oxime reactivators were tested for their in vitro ability to reactivate paraoxon-inhibited human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase and human plasma butyrylcholinesterase to find out structure-activity relationship within this set of compounds. Their reactivation ability was compared with commercially available acetylcholinesterase reactivators (pralidoxime, methoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime, and HI-6).
We reviewed the medical records of children and adolescents aged &lt;or= 18 years hospitalized with alcohol intoxication alone in the University Children's Hospital in Bratislava, Slovak Republic, during the years 1996-2005 and compared their characteristics between the first and the second 5-year time periods.
Urine samples were collected at emergency wards in Sweden from patients who either admitted or were suspected of ingestion of psychoactive plant materials. The bioanalytical investigation employed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry multicomponent method covering 10 plant-derived substances (atropine, dimethyltryptamine, ephedrine, harmaline, harmine, ibogaine, lysergic acid amide, psilocin, scopolamine, and yohimbine) and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for asarone. Routine testing for illicit drugs was also performed.
All isolated acute aripiprazole exposures reported to a poison control system from January 2002 through September 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with incomplete information or those lost to follow-up were excluded.
An instrument was developed to assess the perceived need for communication training for specialists in poison information (SPIs) with input from focus groups and a panel of experts. Requests to respond to an online questionnaire were made to PCCs throughout the United States and Canada.
A 65-year-old lady presented to our hospital's accident and emergency department with recurrent syncope attacks. Electrocardiogram monitoring showed QT prolongation and transient Torsades de Pointes (TDP) ventricular tachycardia. She was taking anticancer naturopathic drugs for 6 weeks before admission. One of her naturopathic drugs was subsequently confirmed containing 89% CsCl by weight. Besides conventional treatment of QT prolongation and TDP, the patient was given a 4-week course of oral Prussian blue to enhance gastrointestinal elimination of cesium. The serum half-life of cesium was reduced from 61.7 to 29.4 days after the use of Prussian blue. QT prolongation was normalized in 27 days.
A male worker in an upholstery factory was confined in the tanning machine for 15 min. The device was used to contain sodium sulfate, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid. On admission, he was confused with Glasgow coma scale score as 9. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 80/58 mmHg; pulse rate, 114 bpm; respiratory rate, 30 bpm; temperature, 37.1 degrees C; and oxygen saturation, 48%. He was intubated. Physical examination disclosed extensive subcutaneous emphysema on the neck and pinkish foamy discharge from the mouth. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum that warranted bilateral tube thoracostomy. Bronchoscopy demonstrated web-shaped hyperemic areas on the upper airway mucosa with aphtous lesions in the base. Extensive hemorrhage and edema were evident around epiglottis. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and mechanically ventilated. He was discharged without any sequelae on day 8.
A 4-year-old girl was admitted 25 h after accidentally ingesting approximately 27 pills of sibutramine (15 mg, approximately 23 mg/kg). The child developed clinical features suggestive of SS, including diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, insomnia, incoordination, hypertonia (lower limbs &gt;&gt; upper limbs), and hallucinations. Serum creatine phosphokinase levels reached a peak on day 3 (2,577 U/L, reference value &lt;145), suggesting mild rhabdomyolysis. No relevant changes were detected in other laboratory examinations or in the electrocardiogram throughout the period of hospitalization. The quantification of sibutramine and the active metabolites, M1 (mono-desmethyl sibutramine) and M2 (di-desmethyl sibutramine), by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in six sequential samples collected from 25 to 147 h post-ingestion revealed a nonlinear decrease in the log-scale plasma concentrations. Treatment was only supportive and involved prolonged sedation to control the agitation, sleeplessness, and hypertension; no cyproheptadine was used. The patient was discharged on day 6 and follow-up revealed no sequelae.
A 48-year-old man had ingested three handfuls of Atropa belladonna. Within 6 h he experienced phases of disorientation, aggressiveness, and tachycardia. He was initially treated with diazepam, an intravenous infusion of physostigmine and activated charcoal. After temporary improvement his clinical condition worsened and he was transferred to our toxicological intensive care unit. Here, ongoing sedation and continuous administration of physostigmine was necessary because of disorientation. In the early phase of hospitalization, a blood sample was taken and a muscarinic receptor total binding equivalent to binding of 130 microg/L atropine was determined by a radio receptor technique. Within 2 days the patient recovered completely and was discharged in a good general condition.
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register.
Randomised trials comparing active and expectant management of the third stage of labour in women who were expecting a vaginal delivery.

We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (2000-2007), MEDLINE (1950-2007) and CINAHL (1982-2007). We also handsearched the Journal of Interprofessional Care (1999 to 2007) and reference lists of the five included studies.
Randomised controlled trials of practice-based IPC interventions that reported changes in objectively-measured or self-reported (by use of a validated instrument) patient/client outcomes and/or health status outcomes and/or healthcare process outcomes and/or measures of IPC.
At least two of the three reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. One author extracted data from and assessed risk of bias of included studies, consulting with the other authors when necessary. A meta-analysis of study outcomes was not possible given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in relation to clinical settings, interventions and outcome measures. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format.
Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal hand searching by the Cochrane Collaboration, mainly in the English language.

Randomisation and commencement of treatment needed to be as soon as possible after the start of CV and usually in the first 12 hours of life.
The methodological quality of each trial was independently reviewed by the various authors. The standard effect measures are relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) to produce one outcome were calculated. For all measures of effect, 95% confidence intervals were used. In subgroup analyses the 99% CIs are also given for summary RRs in the text. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model. Where heterogeneity was over 50%, the random effects RR is also given.

Studies of a reminder delivered via a computer system routinely used by clinicians, with a randomised or quasi-randomised design and reporting at least one outcome involving a clinical endpoint or adherence to a recommended process of care.
Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data. For each study, we calculated the median improvement in adherence to target processes of care and also identified the outcome with the largest such improvement. We then calculated the median absolute improvement in process adherence across all studies using both the median outcome from each study and the best outcome.
The sources used were: EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, bibliographies of published papers, and personal communication with authors.

We included published RCTs of interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to no intervention, usual care, and alternate interventions. We excluded studies in which participants were not making an active treatment or screening decision, or if the study's intervention was not available to determine that it met the minimum criteria to qualify as a patient decision aid.
Two review authors independently screened abstracts for inclusion, and extracted data from included studies using standardized forms. The primary outcomes focused on the effectiveness criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration: attributes of the decision and attributes of the decision process. We considered other behavioural, health, and health system effects as secondary outcomes. We pooled results of RCTs using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model.

The search strategy developed for the Movement Disorders Group was undertaken. Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, EMBASE and Clinical Trials Database of the United States National Institute of Health were thoroughly searched up until December 2007.
All randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted on any symptomatic therapy used for HD with at least ten participants were included. Participants should have HD clinical features and a confirmatory genetic diagnosis or a compatible family history. All disease variants and ages of disease onset were included. Cross-over studies were included. All pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at the control of signs and symptoms associated with HD were to be selected.
Two reviewers independently assessed the identified trials for eligibility. In the selected trials, the assessment of their methodological quality was done according to the Cochrane Collaboration handbook, and eligible data were registered onto standardised forms. If possible, an intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. When data were not available in the original publication, the principal investigator of the trial was contacted. A meta-analysis was conducted when possible and otherwise the descriptive summary of the results was provided. The software Revman 5.0.15 was used for statistical analysis.
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (December 2008).
Randomised controlled trials of allergen exposure reduction for the primary prevention of asthma in children. Interventions were multifaceted (reducing exposure to both inhalant and food allergens) or monofaceted (reducing exposure to either inhalant or food allergens) Follow up had to be from birth (or during pregnancy) up to a minimum of two years of age.
We included in the analysis studies assessing the primary outcome (current diagnosis: asthma) and/or one of the secondary outcomes (current respiratory symptoms: wheezing, nocturnal coughing and dyspnoea). We pooled multifaceted and monofaceted intervention trials separately. We made an indirect comparison of their effects using tests for interaction to calculate relative odds ratios.
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched April 2 2009), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to April 2 2009), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to April 2 2009) and contacted authors of relevant publications and other experts to obtain additional references, unpublished trials, and ongoing trials.
We intended to include all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of any immunotherapy in participants with the condition fulfilling all the following: diabetes mellitus as defined by internationally recognised criteria, acute or subacute onset of pain and lower motor neuron weakness involving predominantly the proximal muscles of the lower limbs, weakness that is not confined to one nerve or nerve root distribution and exclusion of other causes of lumbosacral radiculopathies and plexopathy.
Two authors independently examined all references retrieved by the search to select those meeting the inclusion criteria.
The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety &amp; Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug-approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand-searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied.
Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active antidepressive agents (including non-conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected.
Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 November 2008.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of laser treatment of drusen in AMD in which laser treatment had been compared with no intervention or sham treatment. Two types of trials were included. Some trials studied one eye of each patient (unilateral studies); other studies recruited patients with bilateral drusen and randomised one eye to photocoagulation or control and the fellow eye to the other group.
Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We pooled data from unilateral and bilateral studies using a random-effects model. For the bilateral studies, we estimated the within-patient correlation coefficient from one study and assumed it was valid for the others.
We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library) and the following English language electronic databases (from their inception to the present): MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, NLH on the 30/04/09.We also searched Chinese language electronic databases: Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Sci &amp; Tech Journals (VIP), Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), and Chinese Medical Current Contents (CMCC).
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving CHM versus placebo, biomedical treatment, another CHM intervention, or CHM plus biomedical treatment versus biomedical treatment were selected. Only trials with confirmed randomisation procedures and laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis were included.
