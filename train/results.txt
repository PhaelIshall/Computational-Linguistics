Sodium loading caused a slight but not significant decrease of free UNE after 1 and 2 weeks then clear increments of total (free + conjugated) UNE, free UE and total UE after 4 weeks. Bmax of renal dopamine receptor did not change after 1 and 2 weeks but significantly decreased after 4 weeks (before: 535.9 fmol/mg X protein, after 4 weeks: 327.2 fmol/mg X protein). Kd of renal dopamine receptor slightly elevated 1 week after sodium loading and then returned to the initial level.
About 30 children with air-ways obstruction and positive at the bronchostimulation test to food's allergens 7 were Prick and Rast positive to aeroallergens'; 12 showed total obstruction of nasal pipes and audiometric and impedentiometric troubles, 15 obstruction of one only nasal pipe, 3 absence of obstruction. At the spirometric check and of Rresp in the 63.3% of children was associated obstruction of peripheral air-ways and in the 26.6% laryngeal obstruction. The only nasal obstruction was present in 10% of children, in the 48% was associated to conjunctivitis. In 12 children with audiometric and impedentiometric damage who were adenoidectomized two months after the surgical intervention the nasal condition showed evident improvement but in 5 children after one year the nasal obstruction showed itself again. The food allergens exclusion caused disappearance of nasal, laryngeal and peripheral obstructive syndrome and normalization of audiometric and impedentiometric values in the adenoidectomized subjects and in 95% of staying children.
Fourteen different pathogens or potential pathogens were recovered, in numbers of 2 x 10(1) to 2 x 10(7)colony-forming units. The greatest number of colonies was most often recovered from the sputum specimen, and statistical analysis showed no differences in rate or magnitude of contamination between M-U and S-U catheters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Volume effects: only at the RUL was there a small but significant decrease in all three parameters with increasing lung volume. Airflow effects: all parameters were independent of airflow except for a weakly positive relationship (r = 0.285, P less than 0.05) for Q3 at the RUL location. Individually, there were weakly significant trends in three of the five subjects. These data suggest that the frequency composition of the vesicular lung sound in groups of healthy adults is not systematically affected by changes in lung volume or airflow.
1) The mechanical activity during fasting condition differs from that after feeding. 2) During fasting, the contractile force is decreased for about 15%-20% after SPV without pyloroplasty and for about 50% after SPV with pyloroplasty. The frequency remains unchanged. 3) After feeding, the contractile force is decreased by about 50%, the frequency shows an increase of 100%. The same results can be obtained after SPV with or without pyloroplasty. 4) After metoclopramide the contractile force is increased up to 30%, during fasting, after feeding, and also before and after SPV. The frequency, however, shows no significant change. 5) The postoperative findings remained unchanged throughout the entire observation period (up to the 20th postoperative month).
To calculate the intraocular lens that achieves emetropia after corneal refractive surgery it is necessary to correct the Kpost and to estimate the effective lens position again correcting it. There are different formulae depending on the available information. Ideally, we need pre (Kpre) and post-treatment keratometry record (Kpost) and pre (Rpre) and post (Rpost) refraction. In this way, we can use the Aramberri's double-K method in the formula for calculating intraocular lens power.
The average follow-up was 9.7 months (range 4.5 to 15) for the Ex-PRESS group and 10.3 months (range 3.5 to 14.5) for the trabeculectomy group. The mean IOP was significantly higher in the early postoperative period in the Ex-PRESS group compared with the trabeculectomy group. Complications rate in the early postoperative period was significantly higher in the trabeculectomy group. No significant differences were objectified in success between both groups after the first week.
The repeated measures test performed on 24 hours and 1 month data revealed a significant difference between the two treatments in terms of Tyndall (p = 0.001) and flare (p= 0.034) values; these variables being lower in the dexamethasone group. No differences were observed in the remaining variables examined.
The study group was composed by 74 eyes of 74 patients. The RNFL thickness average was 90.71 microm (SD: 19.93), 88.30 microm (SD: 20.59) and 97.45 microm (SD: 14.30), before cataract surgery (AVGT0), the day after surgery (AVGT1) and one month later (AVGT2) respectively. We did not find statistically significant difference between AVGT0 and AVGT1 (P=0.37); however, statistically significant difference between AVGT1 and AVGT2 (P= 0.002) as well as in the image signal quality between AVGT0 and AVGT2 (P= 0.0001).
At all gestational ages (GA), TLR-4 was associated with a decreased risk of developing CP (homozygous/heterozygous odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.98) and interleukin (IL)-6 was associated with an increased risk of developing hemiplegia (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.83). For infants born 32-36 weeks GA, there was a tenfold increase in the risk of quadriplegic CP with homozygous/heterozygous IL-6 (OR 10.42, 95% CI 1.34-80.82). Viral exposure in combination with IL-4 in preterm infants was associated with a fourfold increased risk of quadriplegia (homozygous/heterozygous OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.21-14.95). In very preterm infants, the absence of detectable viral exposure in combination with IL-4 decreased the risk of developing CP (homozygous/heterozygous OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.76).
Over the ten years to 2006, 76 813 patients underwent first trimester screening, with 120 having an extremely large NT. Thirty-one cases had normal karyotypes, of which there were four sets of twins that demised. Six cases miscarried and ten were terminated, some with morphological abnormalities. Eight cases were still alive for the morphology scan, with the only abnormality being mild pyelectasis in one case. At birth, three cases were normal and another three cases had a good outcome. Two cases had coarctation of the aorta and a good outcome. One case had Noonan's syndrome, another had cerebral palsy and the case with pyelectasis had hydronephrosis, dilated ureters and some contractures.
Screening 44 535 patients resulted in 197 with PAPP-A levels &lt; or = 0.2 MoM. The incidence of karyotypic abnormality increased with decreasing PAPP-A levels. In the absence of chromosome abnormality, pregnancy outcomes were defined as 'normal' in at least 30% and 'good' in at least 60%, with both percentages increasing as the PAPP-A level rose. The PAPP-A levels were significantly lower in the group with a poor outcome. The incidence of prematurity was similar in the three groups, but higher than the statewide average, while the incidence of extreme prematurity appeared to be related to reducing PAPP-A levels. The incidence of growth restriction in the three groups was similar, but was still double the incidence in the normal population.
No demographic differences were observed between groups. There was no significant difference between groups in infectious morbidity (P = 0.87) (relative risk (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-2.11), endometritis (P = 0.72) (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.39-7.14), febrile morbidity (P = 0.66) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51-2.87), wound infection (P = 0.82) (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44-2.81), endometritis (P = 0.72) (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.39-7.14) or urinary tract infection (P = 1.00) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.28-3.50), and estimated blood loss (P = 0.2). However, group A had longer operative times compared with the group B (P = 0.01).
In both groups, 31 of 50 women (62%) delivered vaginally. Instrumental delivery and caesarean section rates did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.78, relative risk = 1). The mean duration of active second stage for the control group was 53.96 min compared with 57.26 min for the intervention group. This difference of 3.3 min was not statistically significant (P = 0.56). Knowledge of women in the intervention group was increased and the majority of women found the educational sessions helpful.
The number of infants of opiate-dependent mothers (IODMs) identified to be of Aboriginal ethnicity was 47 in the rural and 50 in the metropolitan setting. This reflected a significantly higher proportion in the rural versus metropolitan areas (70.1% vs 21.6%, P &lt; 0.05). The effect of rurality was independent of ethnicity with significantly lower rates of neonatal withdrawal requiring treatment (P &lt; 0.001), antenatal consultations (P &lt; 0.01), department of community services (DoCS) involvement (P &lt; 0.001) and shorter infant lengths of stay (P &lt; 0.001). There was a non-significant trend towards more intrauterine growth restriction in Aboriginal infants. There were no significant differences in parameters in rural Indigenous versus rural non-Indigenous infants.
There were 86 stillbirths (rate 7.2 per 1000 births). The percentage of unexplained stillbirths was 34% and 13% before and after CPG investigations, respectively. Unexplained stillbirths had the highest compliance with the recommended investigations. The initial cause of death documented on the death certificate was changed by the PMAC in 19 cases. The investigations most likely to prompt a change in the cause of death classification were autopsy and placental pathology.
Three constructs of a birth centre were identified. A 'commitment to normality of pregnancy and birth' was most commonly reported as the most important philosophy (44%). The predominant model of care was group practice/caseload midwifery (63%). Thirteen birth centres were located within/attached to a hospital, two were on a hospital campus and one was freestanding. The distance to the nearest labour ward ranged from 2 m to 15 km. Reported intrapartum transfer rates ranged from 7% to 29%. Thirteen centres had a special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit onsite, or both. Eight centres undertook artificial rupture of membranes for induction of labour, while two administered oxytocin or prostaglandins. All centres offered nitrous oxide and local anaesthetic. Twelve centres had systemic opioids available and one offered pudendal analgesia. Fetal monitoring was used in all birth centres. Only three centres conducted instrumental deliveries, while 15 performed episiotomies.
The vast majority of the cases (75.5%) were of concordance in diagnosis. Among the 135 discordant diagnoses were 98 with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) biopsy and negative Pap test and 34 with negative biopsy and LSIL Pap test. With rare exceptions, no significant discordance between concurrent biopsy and Pap test was found in the cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Cervical parakeratosis/hyperkeratosis was noted in 87.8% of the LSIL biopsies with concurrent negative Pap tests. An 83.3% HPV-negative rate was also observed in this group. By comparison, parakeratosis/hyperkeratosis was less frequent (62.6%) in the SIL biopsies with concordant concurrent SIL Pap tests and usually seen focally when present. The negative HPV rates for these concordant LSIL and HSIL groups were 12.7% and 0.0%, respectively.
Of 500 questionnaires 460 were returned; 29% of participants had used EC in the past. Only 20% understood the correct timeframe in which EC can be used; 40% were not aware of its availability over-the-counter in pharmacies, and more than 20% felt unable to purchase EC in a pharmacy where they could be recognised. Only 44% of participants were aware of the cost of EC.
Twenty-four consecutive gynaecologists have been enrolled in the study - 14 were specialists and ten were obstetrics and gynaecology trainees. Mean age was 44.4 years (range 35-58 years). Pre- and post-course subjective assessment measuring VAS improved significantly for all variables. Objective measurements of pre- and post-course mean MCQ results also improved significantly from 71% to 84.5%, respectively (P-value &lt; 0.0001). There was dramatic improvement in the performing of motor skills in the dry laboratory.
Twenty-one women elected to have a hysterectomy and seven of those (33%) had no persisting hyperplasia at surgery. Twenty-six women had a LNG-IUS inserted at initial hysteroscopy dilatation and curettage or shortly afterwards; seven of those elected to proceed to hysterectomy when their diagnosis was known. Among ten women who used oral progestin treatment, 90% showed initial regression; two with recurrent EH were subsequently treated successfully with LNG-IUS. All 21 women (100%), including one with atypia, treated with LNG-IUS for more than seven weeks had normal endometrial histology on subsequent assessment. No women developed endometrial cancer. Pooled analysis of the published literature gave a 96% regression rate for non-atypical EH treated with LNG-IUS.
Of 2364 women studied, the overall prevalence of high-risk HPV DNA detection rate was 25.6%. The prevalence peaked at 49.1% for women between 20 and 24 years old and declined to 23% among women between the age of 30 and 49 years. A small second peak of prevalence rate of 30% was observed among women above the age of 50 years old. 76.1% of the high-risk HPV infection regressed within the study period. An incidence infection rate of 16% was noted among a small group of women who had a second HPV DNA test. A total of 1153 women had both the HPV DNA and the cytology tests. Cytological abnormality (ASCUS or more) was detected in 8.9% in HPV DNA-positive group and in 3.1% in HPV DNA-negative group (P &lt; 0.001). The risk ratio for HSIL was 9.8 for HPV-positive women compared to HPV-negative women. The prevalence of cytological abnormalities increased with increasing age of the women.
Prevalence of 14 HOME FAST items was significantly reduced from baseline to follow-up (P &lt;or= 0.05). Falls were significantly related to the baseline HOME FAST score (odds ratio (OR) 1.016, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.004-1.098, P = 0.006), and a reduction in home hazards at follow-up (OR 0.984, 95% CI 0.973-0.996, P = 0.02).
The role of NAs often extends beyond their scope of practice. NAs describe making clinical decisions, initiating clinical care and advocating for residents.
A third (37%, n = 318) reported at least one fracture and 871(99.7%) reported at least one risk factor for osteoporosis. Despite this only 28% reported a diagnosis of osteoporosis, which was more likely if they had sustained a fracture. Bone mineral density tests were reported by 37.4% of respondents and 51.9% of those who had fractured. Only 34.5% who had fractured had been referred for an osteoporosis assessment following their fracture.
While an increase in instrumental support from children to older people is associated with deterioration in the subjective health of older men, financial support from older people to children is associated with improvement in the formers' subjective health. Although an increase in instrumental support from older people to children, and mutual emotional support is associated with improved subjective health of older women, financial support from children to older women has a negative effect on the latter's subjective health.
At 42 months, the group with slower baseline IT had significantly poorer performance (slower completion, higher errors) on more than half of the everyday functioning tasks.
All groups responded in a similar manner. Following the physical activity circuit, mediolateral COP displacement and standard deviation of mediolateral COP position increased by 5% and 17%, respectively. Anteroposterior COP displacement and COP standard deviation, and total COP displacement, did not change. All changes were small compared with the magnitude of the group differences.
We develop different approaches for showing how competing ordinary differential equation (ODE) based models of the same biological phenomenon containing nonlinearities and parametric uncertainty can be invalidated using experimental data. We first emphasize the strong interplay between system identification and model invalidation and we describe a method for obtaining a lower bound on the error between candidate model predictions and data. We then turn to model invalidation and formulate a methodology for discrete-time and continuous-time model invalidation. The methodology is algorithmic and uses Semidefinite Programming as the computational tool. It is emphasized that trying to invalidate complex nonlinear models through exhaustive simulation is not only computationally intractable but also inconclusive.
Here we propose a novel methodology that takes into account the structure of both the binding pocket and the ligand. We first look for local similarities in a set of binding pockets and then check whether the bound ligands, even if completely different, share a common fragment that can account for the presence of the structural motif. Thanks to this method we can identify structural motifs whose functional significance is explained by the presence of shared features in the interacting ligands.
CXCR4 overexpression was detected in 34 of 43 (79.1%) patients with bone metastases and in 57 of 138 (41.3%) without bone metastases. CXCR4 expression correlated with (correlation coefficient: 0.551, P &lt; 0.001) and was predictive of HCC bone metastases (AUC: 0.689; 95%CI: 0.601 - 0.776; P &lt; 0.001). CXCR4 staining intensity correlated with the bone metastasis-free survival (correlation coefficient: -0.359; P = 0.018). CXCR4 overexpression in primary tumors (n = 91) decreased overall median survival (18.0 months vs. 36.0 months, P &lt;0.001). Multivariable analysis identified CXCR4 as a strong, independent risk factor for reduced disease-free survival (relative risk [RR]: 5.440; P = 0.023) and overall survival (RR: 7.082; P = 0.001).
We report here for the first time that NK cell-activating receptors NKp30 and NKp46 are significantly down-regulated in cervical cancer and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) patients. NCRs down-regulation correlated with low cytolytic activity, HPV-16 infection and clinical stage. NKG2D was also down-regulated in cervical cancer patients.
DCA induced persistent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor with Fra-1 and JunB identified as the predominant components of the DCA-induced AP-1 complex. DCA activated Fra-1 via the Erk1/2- and p38 MAPK while Erk1/2 is upstream of JunB. Moreover, DCA stimulation mediated inhibition of proliferation with concomitant low levels of caspase-3-dependent PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Induction of the anti-apoptotic protein COX-2 by DCA, via MAPK/AP-1 pathway appeared to balance the DCA mediated activation of pro-apoptotic markers such as PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Both of these markers were increased upon COX-2 suppression by aspirin pretreatment prior to DCA exposure.
In proliferating embryonic stem cells, p53 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. DNA damage-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 in embryonic stem cells activates transcription of the target genes mdm2, p21, puma and noxa. We observed bi-phasic kinetics for nuclear accumulation of p53 after ionizing radiation. During the first wave of nuclear accumulation, p53 levels were increased and the p53 target genes mdm2, p21 and puma were transcribed. Transcription of noxa correlated with the second wave of nuclear accumulation. Transcriptional activation of p53 target genes resulted in an increased amount of proteins with the exception of p21. While p21 transcripts were efficiently translated in 3T3 cells, we failed to see an increase in p21 protein levels after IR in embryonal stem cells.
By preventing female resistance, we show that females make a substantial contribution towards shortening copulations. We staged matings under different sex ratio conditions, and provide evidence that copulation duration is a form of male reproductive investment that responds to the perceived intensity of sperm competition as predicted by game theoretical models. Further, we investigated potential benefits to persistent males, and costs to females coerced into longer matings. While males did not benefit in terms of increased progeny production by protracting copulation, female remating was delayed after long first copulations.
Participants described facilitators and barriers to successful transition of diabetes care at the provider, patient and systems level. Major facilitators included clear communication of a detailed, structured plan of care, ongoing access to specialist services for advice or re-referral, continuing education and mentoring for PCPs. Identified provider barriers were gaps in PCP knowledge and confidence related to diabetes treatment, excessive workload and competing time demands. Systems deterrents included reimbursement policies for health professionals and inadequate funding for diabetes medications and supplies. At the PCP-patient interface, insufficient patient confidence or trust in PCP's ability to manage diabetes, poor motivation and "non-compliance" emerged as potential patient barriers to transition. Incongruence between PCP attitudes and expectations related to diabetes self-management and those of patients who had attended a multidisciplinary specialist center was also observed.
We treat the causal inference as a 'chain' of mathematical conditions that must be satisfied to conclude that the potential mediator is causal for the trait, where the inference is only as good as the weakest link in the chain. P-values are computed for the component conditions, which include tests of linkage and conditional independence. The Intersection-Union Test, in which a series of statistical tests are combined to form an omnibus test, is then employed to generate the overall test result. Using computer simulated mouse crosses, we show that type I error is low under a variety of conditions that include hidden variables and reactive pathways. We show that power under a simple causal model is comparable to other model selection techniques as well as Bayesian network reconstruction methods. We further show empirically that this method compares favorably to Bayesian network reconstruction methods for reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks in yeast, recovering 7 out of 8 experimentally validated regulators.
To aid the discovery of RNA motifs within the marine metagenome we exploited the genomic properties of 'Cand. P. ubique' by targeting our search to long intergenic regions (IGRs) with relatively high GC content. Analysis of known RNAs (rRNA, tRNA, riboswitches etc.) shows that structured RNAs are significantly enriched in such IGRs. To identify additional candidate structured RNAs, we examined other IGRs with similar characteristics from 'Cand. P. ubique' using comparative genomics approaches in conjunction with marine metagenomic data. Employing this strategy, we discovered four candidate structured RNAs including a new riboswitch class as well as three additional likely cis-regulatory elements that precede genes encoding ribosomal proteins S2 and S12, and the cytoplasmic protein component of the signal recognition particle. We also describe four additional potential RNA motifs with few or no examples occurring outside the metagenomic data.
In interphase, aberrant cell and aberration frequency involving chromosome 1 and/or 2 increased linearly with radiation dose. In metaphase, aberrations increased in a linear-quadratic manner with dose. Our studies ascertain that chromosome-2 is more radio-sensitive than chromosome-1 in both interphase and metaphase stages, albeit the DNA content of chromosome-2 is lesser than chromosome-1 by almost 10 million base pairs.
The recombinant His6-alpha-IPMS proteins with two and 14 copies (alpha-IPMS-2CR and alpha-IPMS-14CR, respectively) of the repeat units were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Both enzymes were found to be dimers by gel filtration. Both enzymes work well at pH values of 7-8.5 and temperatures of 37-42 degrees C. However, alpha-IPMS-14CR tolerates pH values and temperatures outside of this range better than alpha-IPMS-2CR does. alpha-IPMS-14CR has higher affinity than alpha-IPMS-2CR for the two substrates, alpha-ketoisovalerate and acetyl CoA. Furthermore, alpha-IPMS-2CR was feedback inhibited by the end product l-leucine, whereas alpha-IPMS-14CR was not.
Surface motility was observed on minimal defined agar plates with 0.5% agarose, similar in nature to swarming motility identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We examined this motility under several culture conditions, including inhibition of flagellar motility using Congo Red. We demonstrated that the presence of a wetting agent, mineral, and nutrient content of the media altered the swarming phenotype. We also demonstrated that the wetting agent reduces the surface tension of the agar. We were able to directly observe the presence of the wetting agent in the presence and absence of Congo Red, and found that incubation in a humidified chamber inhibited the production of wetting agent, and also slowed the progression of the swarming colony. We observed that swarming was related to both carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as mineral salts base. The phosphate concentration of the mineral base was critical for growth and swarming on glucose, but not succinate. Swarming on other carbon sources was generally only observed using M9 salts mineral base. Rapid swarming was observed on malic acid, d-sorbitol, casamino acids, and succinate. Swarming at a lower but still detectable rate was observed on glucose and sucrose, with weak swarming on maltose. Nitrogen source tests using succinate as carbon source demonstrated two distinct forms of swarming, with very different macroscopic swarm characteristics. Rapid swarming was observed when ammonium ion was provided as nitrogen source, as well as when histidine, tryptophan, or glycine was provided. Slower swarming was observed with methionine, arginine, or tyrosine. Large effects of mineral content on swarming were seen with tyrosine and methionine as nitrogen sources. Biofilms form readily under various culture circumstances, and show wide variance in structure under different conditions. The amount of biofilm as measured by crystal violet retention was dependent on carbon source, but not nitrogen source. Filamentous growth in the biofilm depends on shear stress, and is enhanced by continuous input of nutrients in chemostat culture.
We found a positive correlation between psychotic episodes and dementia, number of concomitant medication, and pergolide intake. Odds ratio calculation confirmed the association with dementia. With respect to dopaminergic treatment, pergolide showed the highest odds ratio, levodopa the lowest. An adjusted logistic regression model confirmed the strong association with psychotic episodes and pergolide and no association with levodopa (adjusted odds ratio 2.01 and 0.11, respectively).
The mean DMFT for 12-year-olds was found to be 0.42 with a significant caries index (SiC) of 1.4. Private school attendees had significantly higher DMFT (0.57) when compared to public school attendees (0.4). The untreated caries prevalence was 30.5%. In multivariate analysis caries experience (DMFT &gt; 0) was found to be significantly and directly associated with socioeconomic status. The mean GI for the six index teeth was found to be 1.05 (CI 1.03 - 1.07) and the mean PI was 1.30 (CI 1.22 - 1.38).
In this work we analyzed the physiological role of Photosystem I antenna system in Arabidopsis thaliana both in vivo and in vitro. Plants depleted in individual antenna polypeptides showed a reduced capacity for photoprotection and an increased production of reactive oxygen species upon high light exposure. In vitro experiments on isolated complexes confirmed that depletion of antenna proteins reduced the resistance of isolated Photosystem I particles to high light and that the antenna is effective in photoprotection only upon the interaction with the core complex.
Grey matter volume was significantly reduced bilaterally in the insular cortex of PTSD subjects than non-PTSD. PTSD group also had lower level of activation in insular cortex when performing word encoding and retrieval tasks than non-PTSD group.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity (BMI &gt; or = 85th percentile) was 39.8%, but only 27.2% considered themselves as obese, although 43.4% reported trying to lose weight. Girls were more likely to express weight dissatisfaction than boys, especially those with BMI &gt; or = 95th percentile (62.9% vs. 25.9%). BMI &gt; or = 85th percentile girls were more likely to try to lose weight than boys (84.6% vs. 66.7%). Among all adolescents, 27.2% underestimated and 67.2% correctly judged their own weight status. Multinomial logistic models show that those with BMI &gt; or = 85th percentile, self-perceived as obese, or expressed body dissatisfaction were more likely to try to lose weight; adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 4.52 (2.53-8.08), 18.04 (7.19-45.30), 4.12 (1.64-10.37), respectively. No significant differences were found in diet and physical activity between those trying to lose weight and those not trying, but boys who reported trying to lose weight still spent more television time (P &lt; 0.05).
Between March and September 2006, 390 monks were interviewed, using questionnaires, to assess smoking prevalence including determinants, knowledge and attitudes. Data entry was performed with Epi-Info (version 6.04) and data analysis with SPSS version 11. Descriptive analysis was employed for all independent and dependent variables. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables to compare smoking status, knowledge, attitudes and province. Logistic regression was applied to identify determinants of smoking. Daily current smoking was 11.8%. Controlling for confounding variables, age at start of monkhood and the length of religious education were significant determinants of smoking. The majority of the monks 67.9% were in favor of the idea that offerings of cigarettes should be prohibited and that they should refuse the cigarettes offered to them (30.3%) but, in fact, 34.8% of the monks who were current smokers accepted cigarettes from the public.
Here we show that an analysis of 87,116,501 GenBank sequence files reveals that 42% are associated with a publication or patent. Of these, 71% are associated with PMIDs, and can therefore be linked to a citation record in the PubMed database. The remaining (29%) of publication-associated GenBank entries either do not have PMIDs or cite a publication that is not currently indexed by PubMed. We also identify the journal titles that are linked through citations in the GenBank files to the largest number of sequences.
We developed a pyrosequencing based method to quantify site-specific methylation levels in 32 out of 34 CpG sites in the PRF1 promoter, and also compared methylation pattern in DNAs extracted from whole blood drawn into PAXgene blood DNA tubes (whole blood DNA) or DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC DNA) from the same normal subjects. Sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA and touchdown PCR were highly reproducible (coefficient of variation 1.63 to 2.18%) to preserve methylation information. Application of optimized pyrosequencing protocol to whole blood DNA revealed that methylation level varied along the promoter in normal subjects with extremely high methylation (mean 86%; range 82-92%) in the distal enhancer region (CpG sites 1-10), a variable methylation (range 49%-83%) in the methylation sensitive region (CpG sites 11-17), and a progressively declining methylation level (range 12%-80%) in the proximal promoter region (CpG sites 18-32) of PRF1. This pattern of methylation remained the same between whole blood and PBMC DNAs, but the absolute values of methylation in 30 out of 32 CpG sites differed significantly, with higher values for all CpG sites in the whole blood DNA.
An ANOVA analysis indicated no significant difference (P &gt; 0.72) in BovineSNP50 genotype call rate between DNA extracted from FTA cards by the GenSolve kit or extracted from whole blood by PCI. Two sample t-tests demonstrated that the DNA extracted from the FTA cards produced genotype call and concordance rates that were not different to those produced by assaying DNA samples extracted by PCI from whole blood.
10 trials enrolled a total of 70 388 people, of whom 23 681 (34%) were women and 16 078 (23%) had diabetes mellitus. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. Treatment with statins significantly reduced the risk of all cause mortality (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96), major coronary events (0.70, 0.61 to 0.81), and major cerebrovascular events (0.81, 0.71 to 0.93). No evidence of an increased risk of cancer was observed. There was no significant heterogeneity of the treatment effect in clinical subgroups.
Acute otitis media recurred in 63% (47/75) of children in the amoxicillin group and in 43% (37/86) of the placebo group (risk difference 20%, 95% confidence interval 5% to 35%); 30% (24/78 amoxicillin; 27/89 placebo) of children in both groups were referred to secondary care, and 21% (16/78) of the amoxicillin group compared with 30% (27/90) of the placebo group had ear, nose, and throat surgery (risk difference -9%, -23% to 4%).
In presence of 8-MOP, UV-A light highly significantly increased the cell death of activated lymphocytes. The same was observed to a lesser extent in non-activated cells. Blebs derived from activated lymphocytes after PUVA treatment showed the highest surface exposition of phosphatidylserine. These blebs also displayed a high exposure of the antigens CD5 and CD8 as well as a low exposure of CD28 and CD86.
In the present study, by using a combined bioinformatics and molecular approach, we identified two novel putative targets of miR-16, caprin-1 (cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1) and HMGA1 (high-mobility group A1), and we also studied cyclin E which had been previously recognized as an miR-16 target by bioinformatics database. Using luciferase activity assays, we demonstrated that miR-16 interacts with the 3' UTR of the three target mRNAs. We showed that miR-16, in MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines, down-regulates the expression of caprin-1, HMGA1a, HMGA1b and cyclin E at the protein level, and of cyclin E, HMGA1a and HMGA1b at the mRNA levels.
We analysed the effects of the combination of VEGF-A and HGF on the activation of VEGFR-2 (VEGF receptor-2) and c-met receptors, and on the stimulation of downstream signalling pathways in endothelial cells. We found that VEGFR-2 and c-met do not physically associate and do not transphosphorylate each other, suggesting that co-operation involves signalling events more distal from receptor activation. We demonstrate that the VEGF isoform VEGF-A(165) and HGF stimulate a similar set of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), although the kinetics and strengths of the activation differ depending on the growth factor and pathway. An enhanced activation of the signalling was observed when endothelial cells were stimulated by the combination of VEGF-A(165) and HGF. Moreover, the combination of VEGF-A and HGF results in a statistically significant synergistic activation of ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and p38 kinases. We demonstrated that VEGF-A(165) and HGF activate FAK (focal adhesion kinase) with different kinetics and stimulate the recruitment of phosphorylated FAK to different subsets of focal adhesions. VEGF-A(165) and HGF regulate distinct morphogenic aspects of the cytoskeletal remodelling that are associated with the preferential activation of Rho or Rac respectively, and induce structurally distinct vascular-like patterns in vitro in a Rho- or Rac-dependent manner.
In the present study, we show that emerin and different prelamin A forms influence each other's localization. We show that the accumulation of non-farnesylated as well as farnesylated carboxymethylated lamin A precursors in human fibroblasts modifies emerin localization. On the contrary, emerin absence at the inner nuclear membrane leads to unprocessed (non-farnesylated) prelamin A aberrant localization only. Moreover, we observe that the restoration of emerin expression in emerin-null cells induces the recovery of non-farnesylated prelamin A localization.
Measurements taken by one observer were highly repeatable for both probes as demonstrated by high ICC and low CV values. Probe performance was improved further by firm application. Firm application of the 3 mm probe resulted in ICC values that ranged from 0.936 to 0.986 (p = 0.0001) and CV values between 1.0 and 3.4%. Firm pressure with the 12 mm probe resulted in ICC values that ranged between 0.914 and 0.988 (p = 0.0001) with CV values between 0.7 and 2.1%. In addition, the repeatability SD was low across all frequencies implying that there was low intra-observer variability. Measurements taken by 2 observers with firm application of the 12 mm probe demonstrated moderate reproducibility between 9.8 and 156 kHz, the frequency range in which previous clinical studies have shown predictive association between high cervical resistivity and vaginal delivery: ICC values ranged between 0.528 and 0.638 (p &lt; 0.05), CV values were between 3.3 and 5.2% and reproducibility SD values were also low. In contrast the 3 mm probe demonstrated poor reproducibility at all study frequencies.
We found a significantly increased risk of suicide in men (SMR 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.73) and a moderately increased risk in women (SMR 1.19, 95% CI 0.88-1.57). In both sexes, relative risk of suicide was greatest in the first year after cancer diagnosis (SMR for men 2.42, 95% CI 1.84-3.13; SMR for women 1.44, 95% CI 0.82-2.33), and was also greater in individuals diagnosed with types of cancer with high fatality (SMR for men 2.67, 95% CI 1.71-3.97; SMR for women 2.17, 95% CI 0.80-4.73).
Significant overexpression of UHRF1 was observed in bladder cancer. The overexpression was correlated with the stage and grade of the cancer. Although UHRF1 expression in muscle-invasive cancer was greater than in non-invasive (pTa) or superficially invasive (pT1) cancers, UHRF1 could still be detected by immunohistochemistry in these early-stage cancers. Overexpression of UHRF1 in bladder cancer was associated with increased risk of progression after transurethral resection. High expression of UHRF1 in kidney cancer was also observed. But the increased levels of UHRF1 in kidney cancer were less significant compared with those in bladder cancer.
Of the 987 patients, 26 (2.6%) were found to carry one of the above mutations in the BRCA1 gene: 13 carried the c.5266dupC mutation (1.3%), 6 carried the exon 24 deletion (0.6%), 3 carried the exon 20 deletion (0.3%), and 4 carried the G1738R mutation (0.4%). Among 140 patients with early-onset breast cancer (&lt;40 years), 14 carried one of the four mutations (10.0%).
Incremental effectiveness of XELOX as first-line and second-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer patients was significantly greater. By use of XELOX, patients gained 10.5 QAPFSD from first-line treatment or 11.3 QAPFSD from second-line treatment. Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) was also proven to significantly reduce treatment costs by 3000 euro (JPY 360,000) and 2300 euro (JPY 270,000) for first-line and second-line treatment, respectively. In health-care settings in the United Kingdom, XELOX decreased medical costs for National Health Service by 7600 pound and 3900 pound for patients who received first-line and second-line treatment, respectively.
We detected two AKT1 (E17K) mutations in the tissue samples (2 out of 89) and no mutations in the cell lines. These two AKT1 mutant tumours do not possess any mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN and K-Ras.
Patients with pancreas cancer have significantly increased circulating levels of type IV collagen. In pancreas cancer tissue high levels of type IV collagen expression was found in close proximity to cancer cells in the tumour stroma. Furthermore, pancreas cancer cells were found to produce and secrete type IV collagen in vitro, which in part can explain the high type IV collagen expression observed in pancreas cancer tissue, and the increased circulating levels in pancreas cancer patients. Of clinical importance, our results show that the circulating level of type IV collagen after surgery is strongly related to prognosis in patients treated for pancreas cancer by pancreatico-duodenectomy with curative intent. Persisting high levels of circulating type IV collagen after surgery indicates a quick relapse in disease and poor survival.
High serum ER-alpha and ER-beta bioactivity were independently associated with the presence of breast cancer. Women whose levels of serum ER-alpha and ER-beta bioactivity were in the highest quintile among controls had a 7.57-(95% confidence interval (CI): 2.46-23.32; P=0.0004) and a 10.14 (95% CI: 3.19-32.23; P&lt;0.0001)-fold risk for general and oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, respectively.
When the cases were divided into responders (Dworak grades 3 and 4) and non-responders (grades 1 and 2) groups, good correlations were evident with Ki67 LI, Bax, Grp78, and TS expression. On multiple logistic regression analysis, Ki67 LI, Bax, and TS scores were found to be independent factors. With their use in a logistic model, P-values could predict responder cases with a sensitivity of 82.8% and a specificity of 83.9%.
EWS-FLI1 inhibition induced apoptosis, reduced cell migratory and tumourigenic capacities, and caused reduction in tumour growth. IGF-1 was downregulated and the IGF-1/IGF-1R signalling pathway was impaired. PBK/TOPK (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase) expression was decreased because of EWS-FLI1 inhibition. We showed that TOPK is a new target gene of EWS-FLI1. TOPK inhibition prompted a decrease in the proliferation rate and a dramatic change in the cell's ability to grow in coalescence.
After conjugation with AVE-1642, a humanised anti-IGF1R monoclonal antibody, both QDs (705 nm) or Alexa 680 (small-molecule fluorophore) detected expression and downregulation of IGF1R in vitro. To examine their utility in vivo, either AVE-1642 conjugates were intravenously delivered to mice bearing xenograft tumours of mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing human IGF1R or MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Quantum dot fluorescence was mainly localised to the reticuloendothelial system in several organs and engulfed by macrophages, with only very small amount of QDs detected in the xenograft tumours. Depletion of macrophages by clodronate liposomes did not alter the nonspecific uptake of QDs. In contrast, AVE-1642-conjugated Alexa 680 solely targeted to xenograft tumour and was able to detect IGF1R downregulation, with little nonspecific targeting to other tissues or organs in mice.
The novel cytotoxic RH1 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-[hydroxymethyl]-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone) is activated by the obligate two-electron reductase DT-diaphorase (DTD, widely expressed in adult tumour cells) to a potent DNA interstrand cross-linker. In acute viability assays against neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma cell lines RH1 IC(50) values ranged from 1-200 nM and drug potency correlated both with DTD levels and drug-induced apoptosis. However, synergy between RH1 and cisplatin or doxorubicin was only seen in low DTD expressing cell lines. In clonogenic assays RH1 IC(50) values ranged from 1.5-7.5 nM and drug potency did not correlate with DTD level. In A673 Ewing's sarcoma and 791T osteosarcoma tumour xenografts in mice RH1 induced apoptosis 24 h after a single bolus injection (0.4 mg/kg) and daily dosing for 5 days delayed tumour growth relative to control.
The cell lines tested varied widely in sensitivity to growth inhibition (IC(50)=0.16-12.3 microM), despite comparable Src kinase inhibition by dasatinib (IC(50)=17-37 nM). In the most sensitive cell line, MDA-MB-231, dasatinib treatment induced significant G(1) accumulation with little apoptosis, disrupted cellular morphology, blocked migration, inhibited invasion through Matrigel (P&lt;0.01), and blocked the formation of invadopodia (P&lt;0.001). Importantly, combination treatment with doxorubicin resulted in synergistic growth inhibition in all cell lines and blocked the migration and invasion of the highly metastatic, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line.
c Kit was expressed in 14.7% breast carcinomas (and in 42 out of 586 node-negative tumours). In univariate analysis, (log-rank test) the score of c Kit expression correlated with poor patient outcome P=0.02 and particularly in node-negative cases (P=0.002). In multivariate Cox analysis, c Kit was an indicator of metastasis independent of 25 other concomitantly evaluated markers of prognosis. Logistic regression showed that c Kit ranked 10 out of 25 (P=0.041), and was included in a 10-marker signature that allowed 79.2% of the patients to be correctly classified in the metastatic or metastasis-free categories independently of hormone receptors and HER-2 status. Interestingly, c Kit was also a significant predictor of metastasis in node-negative tumours (2 out of 25 ranking, P&lt;0.0001) and included in a six-marker signature of prognosis, correctly classifying 88.6% of the patients (P&lt;0.0001).
A total of 172 men were treated under general anaesthetic as day-case procedures with 78% discharged a mean 5 h after treatment. Mean follow-up was 346 days (range 135-759 days). Urethral stricture was significantly lower in those with suprapubic catheter compared with urethral catheters (19.4 vs 40.4%, P=0.005). Antibiotics were given to 23.8% of patients for presumed urinary tract infection and the rate of epididymitis was 7.6%. Potency was maintained in 70% by 12 months, whereas mild stress urinary incontinence (no pads) was reported in 7.0% (12 out of 172) with a further 0.6% (1 out of 172) requiring pads. There was no rectal toxicity and no recto-urethral fistulae. In all, 78.3% achieved a PSA nadir &lt; or =0.5 microg ml(-1) at 12 months, with 57.8% achieving &lt; or =0.2 microg ml(-1). Then, 8 out of 13 were retreated with HIFU, one had salvage external beam radiotherapy and four chose active surveillance for small-volume low-risk disease. Overall, there was no evidence of disease (PSA &lt;0.5 microg ml(-1) or negative biopsy if nadir not achieved) after one HIFU session in 92.4% (159 out of 172) of patients.
We have shown that stromal cells of malignant and surrounding normal colorectal tissue express COX-2. In all cell types of malignant tissue, and in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) of neighbouring normal tissue, COX-2 expression was strongly associated with NF-kappaB-p65 expression (Pearson's correlation, P=0.019 for macrophages, P=0.001 for VECs, P=0.002 for fibroblasts (malignant tissue), and P=0.011 for VECs (non-malignant tissue)) but not NF-kappaB-p50 or IKKalpha.
In accordance with genomic data, UBE2C IHC had a significant impact both on MFS and OS (hazard ratio=6.79 - P=0.002; hazard ratio=7.14 - P=0.009, respectively). Akaike information criterion proved that the prognostic power of UBE2C IHC was stronger than that of Ki-67 (and close to that of NPI). Furthermore, multivariate analyses with NPI showed that, contrary to Ki-67 IHC, UBE2C IHC remained an independent factor, both for MFS (adjusted P=0.02) and OS (adjusted P=0.04).
A total of 62 studies were included for p53, 15 for EGFR and 20 for HER-2/neu. P53, EGFR and HER-2/neu status had a modest effect on overall survival (pooled HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.33-1.61 for p53; HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.19 for EGFR and HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.08 for HER-2/neu). Meta-regression analysis for p53 showed that FIGO stage distribution influenced study outcome. For EGFR and HER-2/neu, considerable publication bias was present.
Embryonic stem cells transplanted into seminiferous tubules did not differentiate into germinal cells, but rather they behaved as invasive embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells. The vascular pattern of the experimental teratocarcinomas showed a highly disorganised architecture, and some of the neoplastic capillaries were derived, at least in part, from the original transplanted ES cells.
Comparing the fifth to the first quintile, red meat (HR=1.23; 95% CI=1.00-1.51, P trend=0.22), the heterocyclic amine (HCA), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), (HR=1.26; 95% CI=1.03-1.55; P trend=0.12), and dietary iron (HR=1.25; 95% CI=1.02-1.52; P trend=0.03) were positively associated with breast cancer. We observed elevated, though not statistically significant, risks with processed meat, the HCA 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx), mutagenic activity, iron from meat, and haem iron from meat.
At least one smear was available in 145 (72%) of the 201 patients. Patients with a uVIN-related vulvar SCC more often had an HSIL compared with patients with a dVIN-related SCC (35 vs 2%, P&lt;0.001). A total of 10 of the 13 HSILs were histologically assessed and identical HPV types were found in the vulva and cervix.
Among the general population, the prevalence of cervical abnormalities was 2.6% by visual inspection and 9.5% by liquid-based cytology. Fourteen of 15 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were visual inspection-negative. Human papillomavirus prevalence was 50.8% (32.1% for high-risk types) and relatively constant across all age groups. Being single or reporting &gt; or =3 sexual partners was significantly associated with HPV positivity. HPV16 was the most common type, both among the general population (7.3%) and, notably in ICC (48.6%). HPV45 (18.6%) and HPV18 (14.3%), the next most common types in ICC, were also more common in ICC than in HPV-positive women with normal cytology from the general population.
The invasive cancer incidence decreased by 47.8% during 1995-2006. The carcinoma in situ incidence increased 1.7-fold during 1995-2000, and decreased by 19.6% during 2000-2006.
GISTs with delTyr were more frequently extragastric than those with delWK (69 vs 26%, P&lt;0.0005). After curative surgery, median relapse-free survival were 10.8 and 11.1 months for patients with delTyr (n=14) and delWK (n=29), respectively (P=0.92). All patients treated with imatinib for a non-resectable or metastatic GIST had an objective response (n=15) or a stable disease (n=21) as best response, regardless of mutation. Median progression-free survival with imatinib were 21.9 and 18.9 months for patients with GIST with delTyr (n=14) and delWK (n=22), respectively (P=0.43).
The study revealed nine transcription factors presenting enriched motifs for these gene promoters, five of which are implicated in cellular growth (ELK1, ELK4, RUNX1, HOX11-CTF1, TAL1-ternary complex factor 3) and four in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), GABPA, PPARG-RXRA and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA)). An independent microarray data set showed the overexpression of ELK1, RUNX1 and ESRRA in the thyroid oncocytic tumours. Exploring the thyroid tumours, we found that DAP3 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in tumours presenting a mitochondrial biogenesis compared with the normal tissue. ELK1 and ESRRA were also showed upregulated with DAP3.
There was significant heterogeneity in cancer risk between groups for the following four cancer sites: stomach cancer, RRs (compared with meat eaters) of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.07-1.20) in fish eaters and 0.36 (0.16-0.78) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.007; ovarian cancer, RRs of 0.37 (0.18-0.77) in fish eaters and 0.69 (0.45-1.07) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.007; bladder cancer, RRs of 0.81 (0.36-1.81) in fish eaters and 0.47 (0.25-0.89) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.05; and cancers of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues, RRs of 0.85 (0.56-1.29) in fish eaters and 0.55 (0.39-0.78) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.002. The RRs for all malignant neoplasms were 0.82 (0.73-0.93) in fish eaters and 0.88 (0.81-0.96) in vegetarians (P for heterogeneity=0.001).
Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months with 2-year survival of 17.9%. Pyrosequencing data were reproducible with archival samples yielding data for all glioblastomas. Variation in methylation patterns of discrete CpG sites and intratumoral methylation heterogeneity were observed. A total of 58 out of 109 glioblastomas showed average methylation &gt;non-neoplastic brain in at least one clinical sample; 86% had homogeneous methylation status in multiple samples. Methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Cases with methylation more than 35% had the longest survival (median PFS 19.2; OS 26.2 months, 2-year survival of 59.7%). Significant differences in PFS were seen between those with intermediate or high methylation and unmethylated cases, whereas cases with low, intermediate or high methylation all showed significantly different OS.
The median excretion of daidzein was 0.173 nmol mg(-1) creatinine in cases and 0.291 in controls (P=0.01), and the median excretion of genistein was 0.048 in cases and 0.078 in controls (P=0.05). An inverse association was seen for daidzein overall (odds ratio for the highest vs lowest quintile=0.55, 95% confidence interval=0.31-0.98, P(trend)=0.03) and seemed to apply to localized (P(trend)=0.08) as well as advanced or high-grade cancer (P(trend)=0.09). This association was consistent across the four ethnic groups examined. Although the relationship was weaker for genistein, the odds ratios and trends were similarly inverse. Urinary excretion of equol and enterolactone was not significantly related to prostate cancer risk.
In clinically derived HNSCC samples, CYGB mRNA expression showed a striking correlation with tumour hypoxia (measured by HIF1A mRNA expression P=0.013) and consistent associations with histopathological measures of tumour aggression. CYGB expression also showed a marked negative correlation with promoter methylation (P=0.018). In the HNSCC cell lines cultured under hypoxic conditions, a trend of increasing expression of both CYGB and HIF1A with progressive hypoxia was observed. Treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycitidine dramatically increased CYGB expression in those cell lines with greater baseline promoter methylation.
Women reported a process of evaluation, monitoring, re-evaluation, and, finally, consulting in order to meet their needs. Four key triggers for consulting were identified: failure to alleviate symptoms through self-care; symptom duration and escalation; impeding normal functioning and the fulfilment of social roles; and concern that it may be or become a serious illness.
The quantitative data suggest that the majority of people believe individuals utilise either GP or A&amp;E services inappropriately (65.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 62.4 to 68.7). However, strong views relating to this inappropriate healthcare use were not associated with reported seeking of immediate care (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.46 for 'lump' vignette). Responders tend to consider other people as time wasters, but not themselves. Individuals' generally describe clear rationales for help seeking, even for seemingly trivial symptoms and anxiety level was strongly predictive of health-seeking behaviour (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.98 to 4.19 for lump vignette).
There was no statistically significant difference for patient wellbeing, recurrence rate, survival, recurrence-related serious clinical events, diagnostic delay, or patient satisfaction. GP-led breast cancer follow-up was cheaper than hospital follow-up. Intensified primary health care resulted in increased home-care nurse contact, and improved discharge summary led to increased GP contact. Evaluation of patient-initiated or minimal follow-up found no statistically significant impact on the number of GP consultations or cancer-related referrals.
Nineteen studies were included; seven were linked to randomised controlled trials. Eight studies examined the views of healthcare professionals (four of which included GPs) and 16 examined the views of patients. Twelve descriptive themes were identified, from which 12 perceived implications for practice were derived. Most themes related to conventional follow-up in secondary care. Some views concerning other models of care were based on participants' ideas, rather than experiences.
Of 164 appraisers, 80 agreed to participate; 67/80 (84%) submitted one of three appraisal materials for peer review and returned completed questionnaires. For significant event analyses (n = 44), most responders believed the peer feedback method was feasible (100%) and fair (92.5%) and would add value to appraisal (95.5%). Peer feedback on criterion audits (n = 15) was believed to be acceptable and fair (93.3%) and it was thought it would be a useful educational tool (100%). Completing a consultation video (n = 8) was perceived to be feasible as part of normal general practice (n = 5). It was unanimously agreed that assessment of videos by peers has educational impact and would help improve appraisal.
Participants' cancer experiences were shaped by their previous experience of life, which included deprivation, loneliness, and a lack of autonomy and power. They depended on others to negotiate contact with the outside world, including the healthcare system. This could lead to delayed cancer diagnosis and a lack of treatment options being offered. Most participants were not helped to understand their illness and its implications. Doctors did not make an assessment of capacity, but relied on carers' opinions.
The rate of sickness certification was 101.67 certificates per 1000 person years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 100.13 to 103.21). This rate was significantly higher in women, at 109.76 certificates per 1000 person years (95% CI = 107.550 to 112.02), compared to men who had a rate of 93.68 certificates per 1000 person years (95% CI = 91.59 to 95.78; P&lt;0.001). The rate of sickness certification was greatest for mental health conditions, followed closely by musculoskeletal conditions.
Over 50 prenatal factors have been examined. The factors associated with autism risk in the meta-analysis were advanced parental age at birth, maternal prenatal medication use, bleeding, gestational diabetes, being first born v. third or later, and having a mother born abroad. The factors with the strongest evidence against a role in autism risk included previous fetal loss and maternal hypertension, proteinuria, pre-eclampsia and swelling.
Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Feeding back outcome showed a small, but significant (d = 0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.19) positive short-term effect on the mental health of individuals that did not prevail in the long run. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences regarding feedback modalities. Outcome management did not contribute to a reduction of treatment duration.
The RDC schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (v. controls) stood out from the other diagnostic subsets as having a significant excess of independent association signals (P&lt;0.003) compared with that expected in samples of the same size selected randomly from the total bipolar disorder group data-set. The strongest association in this subset of participants with bipolar disorder was at rs4818065 (P = 2.42 x 10(-7)). Biological systems implicated included gamma amniobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors. Genes having at least one associated polymorphism at P&lt;10(-4) included B3GALTS, A2BP1, GABRB1, AUTS2, BSN, PTPRG, GIRK2 and CDH12.
The 5-HTTLPR moderated the response to escitalopram, with long-allele carriers improving more than short-allele homozygotes. A significant three-way interaction between 5-HTTLPR, drug and gender indicated that the effect was concentrated in males treated with escitalopram. The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2020933 also influenced outcome.
Multilevel analysis revealed higher levels of salivary cortisol in short allele carriers (s/s&gt;s/l&gt;l/l). A subsequent episode of depression was increased in those with higher cortisol and the 's' allele, and independently by depressive symptoms at entry, in both genders.
Prevalence estimates are 6.1% (s.e. = 0.3) for any personality disorder and 3.6% (s.e. = 0.3), 1.5% (s.e. = 0.1) and 2.7% (s.e. = 0.2) for Clusters A, B and C respectively. Personality disorders are significantly elevated among males, the previously married (Cluster C), unemployed (Cluster C), the young (Clusters A and B) and the poorly educated. Personality disorders are highly comorbid with Axis I disorders. Impairments associated with personality disorders are only partially explained by comorbidity.
Outmigration of all children, compared with outmigration of some or no children, was independently associated with less depression in parents. This association remained after taking account of social support, parent characteristics, health and wealth. Parents with all children outmigrated received more economic remittances and they perceived support to be as good as that of those with children close by.
Of the cohort, 42.4% had dementia (only half diagnosed prior to admission). In men aged 70-79, dementia prevalence was 16.4%, rising to 48.8% of those over 90. In women, 29.6% aged 70-79 had dementia, rising to 75.0% aged over 90. Urinary tract infection or pneumonia was the principal cause of admission in 41.3% of the people with dementia. These individuals had markedly higher mortality; 24.0% of those with severe cognitive impairment died during admission (adjusted mortality risk 4.02, 95% CI 2.24-7.36).
The bipolar disorder and schizophrenia groups were most impaired on tests of memory, executive functioning and language. The bipolar group performed significantly better on tests of response inhibition, verbal fluency and callosal functioning. Between-group differences could be explained by the greater proclivity of individuals with schizophrenia to experience global cognitive impairment and negative symptoms.
No significant differences in outcome between the three interventions were found in the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses.
A total of 117 subjects were randomized and 111 completed the study. Compared with placebo, LDX demonstrated significantly greater efficacy at each postdose time point (1.5 hours to 13.0 hours), as measured by SKAMP deportment and attention scales and PERMP (P &lt; .005). The most common treatment-emergent AEs during dose optimization were decreased appetite (47%), insomnia (27%), headache (17%), irritability (16%), upper abdominal pain (16%), and affect lability (10%), which were less frequent in the crossover phase (6%, 4%, 5%, 1%, 2%, and 0% respectively).
The LDH assay supported that cultured for 24 h or less with the JHD-containing serum at the concentration of 10% or lower, RAW264.7 cells showed no cytotoxicity. After stimulation with LPS for 2 h, TNF-alpha in the culture supernate of the 5% blank-control serum plus LPS group (L1, P=0.03), 10% blank-control serum plus LPS group (L2, P=0.002) and in the cell layer (P=0.01) of these groups increased remarkably. After stimulation with LPS for 1 h, the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha (P=0.004), TLR (P=0.03), CD14 (P=0.004) was up-regulated obviously. In the 10% JHD-containing serum plus LPS group (J2), the protein expression of TNF-alpha in both supernate (P=0.04) and cell layer (P=0.04), gene expression of TNF-alpha (P=0.03), TLR4 (P=0.001), CD14 (P=0.001) were all inhibited. On the other hand, the TLR2 mRNA expression was not up-regulated after LPS stimulation in the 10% blank-control serum plus LPS group (L2).
(1) Among the 227 patients, 207 (91.19%) were diagnosed as BSS, in which 95 cases were considered as moderate and the rest 112 cases as severe. (2) There was a negative correlation between age, gender, grades of the hypertension, and the BSS score. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that Upro, CHO, TG, and eGFR were positively related to the BSS score (P&lt;0.05). (3) The BSS score has a positive correlation with indexes of chronic renal pathology, especially the tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The severity of proliferation and glomerular sclerosis was accompanied with higher BSS scores with a significant difference (P&lt;0.05).
Sixty-seven subjects (34 in the RGC group and 33 in the placebo group) completed a 7-week treatment. The RGC group displayed a significantly greater baseline-to endpoint increase in maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) than placebo group in both absolute (P=0.020) and relative values (P=0.023). At the endpoint, the serum cortisol level was unchanged in the RGC group compared with the baseline, but it was significantly elevated in the placebo group (P&lt;0.05). The endpoint ratio of testosterone to cortisol, a surrogate for overtraining and fatigue in endurance exercises, was also indifferent compared with the baseline in the RGC group, but significantly decreased in the placebo group (P&lt;0.05).
The level of CD3(+), CD4(+), the ratio of CD4 and CD8(+), IgA, IgM, IgG and IL-2 decreased in patients with NSCLC on day 1 after operation, and the level of CD8 and TNF-alpha increased compared to pre-operation. While the levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4 /CD8(+), NK cell activity, serum IgA, IgM, IgG, IL-2 began to elevate, CD8 and TNF-alpha levels began to decline in patients administered with DB1 on day 3 after the operation, earlier than patients who did not use the decoction. The level of CYFRA21-1 and CEA, was immediately decreased after operation in both groups.
The mean parasite clearance time and the mean fever clearance time were 43.2+/-13.9 h and 24.7+/-9.9 h, in the Artequick group, and 36.5+/-17.1 h and 22.7+/-11.2 h, in the Artekin group. In both groups the 28-day cure rate was 100%, and the parasite recrudescence rate was 0.
(1) Clinical efficacy: Twenty patients had complete remission (CR), with the CR rate being 50.0%. Among these patients, the CR rate was 73.9% (17/23) in de novo AML and 17.6% (3/17) in secondary or refractory AML, respectively. The median disease free survival (DFS) was 6 months (2-32 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 7 months (1-36 months). (2) Analysis of prognostic factors: Aging (&gt; 60 years) and hepatosplenomegaly or extramedullary leukemia did not affect the treatment outcome. Patients with lower white blood cell (WBC) counts (&lt;4.0x10(9)/L) had a significantly higher CR rate (P&lt;0.01). Secondary or refractory AML was associated with a lower CR rate and shorter OS (P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05). Expression of CD34 was an adverse factor for obtaining CR (P&lt;0.05) and survival in both DFS and OS (P&lt;0.05,P&lt;0.01). The expression of CD56 was significantly associated with a lower CR rate (P&lt;0.05), but did not affect DFS and OS. Twenty-three (57.5%) out of 40 cases had chromosomal abnormalities. The CR rate was decreased and both DFS and OS shortened stepwise from the cases with favorable cytogenetics to those with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics (P&lt;0.01).
The ratio of liver weight to body weight was significantly elevated in the ANIT and CCl(4) groups when compared with that in the normal control (P&lt;0.01). The contents of ALT and T-BIL were significantly higher in the ANIT group than in the normal control (P&lt;0.05,P&lt;0.01), and the levels of AST, ALT and ALP were significantly elevated in CCl(4) group relative to those in the normal control P&lt;0.01). In the YCHD group, the increase in AST, ALT and ALP levels was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), but with no significant increase in serum T-BIL. In the CCl(4) intoxicated group, the MDA content was significantly increased and SOD, GSH-PX activities decreased significantly compared with those in the normal control group, respectively (P&lt;0.01). The increase in MDA induced by CCl(4) was significantly reduced by YCHD P&lt;0.05).
(1) TGA could significantly decrease the production of PGE(2)and NO in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The inhibitory rate to LPS-induced PGE(2)production was 87% (TGA 100 mg/L, P&lt;0.05, vs. LPS) and 62% (TGA 20 mg/L, P&lt;0.05, vs. LPS), respectively. The inhibitory rate of NO production in mouse peritoneal macrophages was 49% (TGA 100 mg/L, P&lt;0.05, vs. LPS) and 21% (TGA 20 mg/L, P&lt;0.05 vs. LPS), respectively. TGA could not inhibit LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in mouse peritoneal macrophages. (2) TGA also inhibited the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA in RAW264.7 cells. The inhibitory rate of TGA to COX-1 mRNA was 22% (TGA 100 mg/L, P&lt;0.05, vs. blank). The inhibitory rate of TGA to COX-2 mRNA was 55% (TGA 20 mg/L, P&lt;0.05, vs. LPS) and 100% (TGA 100 mg/L, P&lt;0.01 vs. LPS), respectively.
No significant difference between the two groups in terms of the total efficacy or the scores of symptoms before and after treatment was found (P&gt;0.05). The number of activated MCs was decreased in the intervention group after treatment, showing significant difference as compared with that before treatment as well as with that in the control group after treatment (P&lt;0.01).
The level of CD8(+)increased and the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+)decreased mainly in colonic mucous membranous tissues in UC patients. The level of CD4(+)decreased significantly in IHDA types (P&lt;0.01), but decreased only slightly in the PSYD, QSBS and YBD types. CD8(+)increased significantly in the IHDA types (P&lt;0.01), but only slightly in the other three types.
Age, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, KPS score change at 2 weeks after operation, neurological deficit symptoms, tumor resection extent, maximal tumor diameter, involvement of eloquent cortex or deep structure, involvement of brain lobe, Ki-67 expression level and adjuvant chemotherapy were statistically significant factors (P &lt; 0.05) for both PFS and OS in the univariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed that age &lt;or= 50 years, preoperative KPS score &gt;or= 80, KPS score change after operation &gt;or= 0, involvement of single frontal lobe, non-eloquent area or deep structure involvement, low Ki-67 expression and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent favorable factors (P &lt; 0.05) for patients' clinical outcomes.
Five of the six patients had a radiographic response. Three were complete response, and two were partial response. Only one patient had progressive disease. The 6-month progession-free survival (PFS) was 33% and the median PFS was 15 weeks, with a range of 6 to more than 60 weeks. Of the three core pathways analyzed in this study, the Ras/MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathways were more likely to be associated with the treatment response to bevacizumab. In two younger patients (ages &lt; 50) with complete response, simultaneous overexpression of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-mTOR might be the crucial feature.
CD133(+) glioblastoma cells exhibited neurosphere-like growth in vitro and high expression of CD133 stem cell marker. The growth-inhibiting rate in CD133(-) glioblastoma cells treated with 5 or 50 micromol/L TMZ was significantly higher than that in CD133(+) glioblastoma cells ((14.36 +/- 3.75)% vs (2.54 +/- 1.36)% or (25.95 +/- 5.25)% vs (2.72 +/- 1.84)%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Atg5, LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels were significantly lower in CD133(+) glioblastoma cells than those in autologous CD133(-) cells after TMZ treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Caspase-3 was mildly activated only in CD133(-) glioblastoma cells after exposure to TMZ (P &lt; 0.05). Immunofluorescent staining revealed elevated expression of Atg5 in GFAP(+) cells following TMZ treatment.
Proliferation of tumor cell was obviously suppressed by temozolomide with thalidomide treatment than by either drug used alone (P = 0.000 for each day). The combination treatment induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Typical autophagic ultra-structural character was found after the combined treatment. Thalidomide promoted the autophagy induced by temozolomide. The autophagy-associated proteins-microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3) and Beclin1 were more significantly up-regulated by the combined treatment than temozolomide used alone (MAP1LC3, P = 0.000; Beclin1, P = 0.004). The expression level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), which promoted autophagy by suppressing PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, was elevated by thalidomide (thalidomide group: P = 0.000; combined group: P = 0.002).
(19)F-MRS on samples from C6-CD::UPRT cells cultured with 5-FC showed three broad resonance signals corresponding to 5-FC, 5-FU and fluorinated nucleotides (F-Nuctd). For the C6 mixture, only the 5-FC peak was detected. In vivo serial (19)F-MRS spectra showed a strong 5-FC peak and a weak 5-FU peak at 20 minutes after 5-FC injection. The 5-FU concentration reached a maximum at about 50 minutes. The F-Nuctd signal appeared after about 1 hour, reached a maximum at around 160 minutes, and was detectable for several hours. At a 10% ratio of C6-CD::UPRT cells, the survival rate was (79.55 +/- 0.88)% (P &lt; 0.01). As the C6-CD::UPRT ratio increased, the survival rate of the cells decreased. (19)F-MRS showed that the signals for 5-FU and F-Nuctd in the culture medium increased as the ratio of C6-CD::UPRT in the mixture increased.
None of the SNPs or haplotypes showed evidence of association to type 2 diabetes. However, rs2235306 was nominally associated with fasting plasma glucose levels in the male subjects with normal glucose regulation ((4.93 +/- 0.03) vs (5.01 +/- 0.03) mmol/L, P = 0.04). No significant difference was observed between all three SNPs and other variables.
Changes involving one or more regions of the genome were seen in all rhabdomyosarcomal patients. For rhabdomyosarcoma, DNA sequence gains were most frequently (&gt; 30%) seen in chromosomes 2p, 12q, 6p, 9q, 10q, 1p, 2q, 6q, 8q, 15q and 18q; losses from 3p, 11p and 6p. In aggressive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, frequent gains were seen on chromosomes 12q, 2p, 6p, 2q, 4q, 10q and 15q; losses from 3p, 6p, 1q and 5q. For embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma, frequent gains were on 7p, 9q, 2p, 18q, 1p and 8q; losses only from 11p. Frequently gained chromosome arms of translocation associated with rhabdomyosarcoma were 12q, 2, 6, 10q, 4q and 15q; losses from 3p, 6p and 5q. The frequently gained chromosome arms of nontranslocation associated with rhabdomyosarcoma were 2p, 9q and 18q, while 11p and 14q were the frequently lost chromosome arms. Gains on chromosome 12q were significantly correlated with translocation type. Gains on chromosome 9q were significantly correlated with clinical staging.
One hundred and twenty-nine MRSA isolates were included in the study: 71 (55%) from the intensive care unit, 35 (27.2%) from the surgical wards and 23 (17.8%) from the medical wards. The most frequent source of isolation of MRSA was sputum (76.7%). From seven patients we isolated MRSA and VRE (E. faecium) simultaneously during their inpatient stay. One hundred and twenty-seven (127/129, 98.4%) MRSA isolates harboured SCCmec type III, only 2 MRSA strains contained SCCmec type II. All of the 129 MRSA isolates remained sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Higher sensitivity rates were noted for chloramphenicol 99.2% (128/129). Only 20.2% (26/129) of the MRSA isolates were sensitive to rifampin. All isolates presented resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents with high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), including: beta-lactams (penicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin), tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin).
Out of 677 serum specimens collected during April 1996 to March 1997, 400 (59.1%) were positive and antibody positive rate for another batch of 141 serum specimens collected in August, 2005 from adults aged from 20 years to over 60 years was 78.7% (111/141). Comparison of the sero-prevalence profiles for serum specimens collected during 1996 - 1997 to those collected in 2005 indicated that the antibody positive rate for specimens collected in 2005 was higher than that of the corresponding age groups collected during 1996 - 1997.
The difference in both SIR and ADC for vertebral metastasis and acute benign vertebral fractures was significant (P &lt; 0.001). A positive correlation between the LR and the SIR was found in benign fractures (P &lt; 0.05). The severity of vertebral damage had a significant influence on the AUC (area under ROC curve) for SIR (P &lt; 0.05) but ADC (P &gt; 0.05). More severe cases were associated with increased AUC for SIR.
ER(-) cells secreted significantly more hyaluronidase (P &lt; 0.001) and expressed significantly more VEGF (P &lt; 0.01), MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.05) and cath-D (P &lt; 0.0001) than ER(+) cells. Invasion through Matrigel by ER(-) Hyase(+) cells was significantly higher than that by ER(+) Hyase(-) cells (P &lt; 0.05). In both cases, invasion was decreased by heparin (P &lt; 0.05). When ECV-304 endothelial cells were co-cultivated in millicell chambers with cancer cells, ECV-304 cells were induced to form tubules. Tubule formation was demonstrated to be more prominent with ER(-) Hyase(+) cells than with ER(+) Hyase(-) cells (P &lt; 0.05).
Striking differences were observed among strains with regard to the ability to form biofilm. Typical membrane-like structure formed by bacterial cells and extracellular matrix was detected. Initial biofilm synthesis was inhibited by azithromycin and ciprofloxacin at concentrations higher than two-fold minimal inhibitory concentration. Disruption of mature biofilms could be achieved at relatively higher concentration, and ciprofloxacin displayed more powerful activity.
With a median follow-up of 12 months, 11 (26.8%) of the 41 patients developed grade 2 and above acute RP. The mean SUV of regions (10 - 19 Gy, 20 - 29 Gy, 30 - 39 Gy, 40 - 49 Gy) increased after radiation therapy in all 41 patients. The mean SUVs after radiation therapy were 0.54, 0.68, 1.31, 1.74 and 2.27 for 0 - 9 Gy, 10 - 19 Gy, 20 - 29 Gy, 30 - 39 Gy and 40 - 49 Gy, respectively. Before the radiation therapy, the mean SUV in each region was 0.53, 0.52, 0.52, 0.53 and 0.54, respectively. These patients had significantly higher FDG activities in regions receiving 10 Gy or more (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with their counterparts, the elevation of SUV was significantly greater in those patients who developed acute RP subsequently.
All treatment groups showed a significantly extended survival time compared with the control group. Photodynamically guided microsurgery combined with photodynamic therapy significantly prolonged survival time, compared with guided microsurgery alone. MRI and the autopsy results confirmed removal of most of the tumours.
Few damages to the ultramicrostructure of cardiocytes were observed after treatment with 3-AB. PARP cleavage was detected as early as 4 hours and markedly increased by 6 hours following AMI without 3-AB, but was not found until 6 hours following AMI treated with 3-AB. There were significant differences between 3-AB and AMI groups at the same time points. The expression of PARP was observed gradually increased, but that of AIF was suppressed for 6 hours after treatment of 3-AB, compared with AMI groups in positive cells at the same time points. There was significantly less cleavage of PARP and more PARP expression in 3-AB treated group compared with AMI and control groups at all matched time points.
Wild-type RASSF1A, not the mutant, suppressed cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Re-expression of wild-type RASSF1A could enhance the inhibition of cell proliferation and the percentage of apoptotic cells following cell treatment with mitomycin, but had no significant effect when combined with adriamycin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin treatment.
The proportion of L/L (15.3% vs 5.2%) and S/L (50.0% vs 33.3%) genotypes was significantly higher in the smokers than that in the non-smokers (chi(2) = 21.9; P &lt; 0.01). The odds ratio (OR) adjusted by age, education, effects of family members and friends who smoke, and alcohol intake was 2.9 (95% CI 1.78 +/- 4.80). In smokers, the number of cigarettes/day (L/L vs S/L vs S/S: 28 +/- 12 vs 20 +/- 8 vs 16 +/- 6, chi(2) = 18.5, P &lt; 0.01), smoking index (L/L vs S/L vs S/S: 561 +/- 446 vs 393 +/- 341 vs 237 +/- 201, chi(2) = 12.5, P &lt; 0.01) and score on the Fagerström test for nicotine dependence (FTND) (L/L vs S/L vs S/S: 7.8 +/- 1.6 vs 6.2 +/- 2.5 vs 3.5 +/- 2.1, chi(2) = 48.3, P &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in smokers with an L/L or S/L genotype than that in the smokers with the S/S genotype. There were no significant differences in the proportion of starting smoking before 20 years old (P = 0.219) and those who succeeded in quitting smoking for more than 1 month (P = 0.456) between individuals with different 5-HTTLPR genotypes in smokers.
The phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox mRNA expression was significantly increased in the OSAHS group than that in the non-OSAHS group (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the non-OSAHS control group ((85.31 +/- 9.23) U/ml), the levels of SOD were lower in patients with OSAHS ((59.65 +/- 11.61) U/ml (P &lt; 0.01). There were significant differences in genotypes distribution in p22phox polymorphism between the two groups (P = 0.02). Compared with the non-OSAHS control group, the OSAHS group had a significantly higher T allele frequency in p22phox polymorphism (P = 0.03). There were independent effects of p22phox polymorphism on body mass index (BMI), neck circumference (NC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in the OSAHS group, and the carriers of the T allele of p22phox polymorphism had greater NC, WHR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (P &lt; 0.05), but the carriers of the T allele had lower SOD (P &lt; 0.01) and lowest SaO(2) (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in p22phox mRNA expression between the OSAHS groups with or without T allele (P = 0.45).
Among 195 HF patients, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was 53% and of central sleep apnea (CSA) was 27%. There was no significant difference of ESS scores between patients without SRBD (NSA) and with SRBD (NSA vs OSA: 6.7 +/- 0.6 vs 7.6 +/- 0.4, P = 0.105 and NSA vs CSA: 6.7 +/- 0.6 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5, P = 0.235, respectively), indicating that SRBD patients had no more subjective daytime sleepiness. Compared with NSA, patients with SRBD had increased arousal index (ArI) (NSA vs OSA: 14.1 +/- 1.4 vs 26.3 +/- 1.5, P &lt; 0.001 and NSA vs CSA: 14.1 +/- 1.4 vs 31.3 +/- 3.5, P &lt; 0.001, respectively), more awake number after sleep onset (NSA vs OSA: 19.2 +/- 1.5 vs 26.2 +/- 1.4, P = 0.01 and NSA vs CSA: 19.2 +/- 1.5 vs 36.9 +/- 4.4, P &lt; 0.001, respectively), and reduced proportion of slow-wave sleep (SWS) (NSA vs OSA: 13.8 +/- 1.7 vs 9.3 +/- 0.7, P = 0.024 and NSA vs CSA: 13.8 +/- 1.7 vs 8.9 +/- 0.9, P = 0.024, respectively).
The mPAP, RV/(LV + S), WT%, and WA% in the HH group were significantly greater than those in the NC (P &lt; 0.01) and HHO groups (P &lt; 0.01); the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and the expressions of Bax, cyt-C and apoptotic index (AI) in the group HH were less than those in the NC and HHO groups; and the expression of Bcl-2 in group HH was greater than that in the NC and HHO groups. HPASMC mitochondrial membrane potentials in group HO was lower than in group HY (P &lt; 0.01), and cyt-C in the cytoplasm, AI, and caspase-9 in the HO group were greater than that in the HY group (P &lt; 0.01), but the expression of Bcl-2 in the HO group was less than that in the HY group (P &lt; 0.05).
PaO(2) in the vehicle + lipopolysaccharide group decreased compared with that in the vehicle + saline group. This decrease was significantly reduced in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group. The lung tissues from the saline + lipopolysaccharide group were significantly damaged, which were less pronounced in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group. The W/D ratio increased significantly in the vehicle + lipopolysaccharide group (6.1 +/- 0.18) as compared with that in the vehicle + saline group (3.61 +/- 0.3) (P &lt; 0.01), which was significantly reduced in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group (4.8 +/- 0.25) (P &lt; 0.01). Myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde levels increased significantly in the vehicle + lipopolysaccharide group compared with that in the vehicle + saline group, which was reduced in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group. The TNF-alpha level of pulmonary tissue increased significantly in the vehicle + lipopolysaccharide group ((8.7 +/- 0.91) pg/mg protein) compared with that in the vehicle + saline group ((4.3 +/- 0.62) pg/mg protein, P &lt; 0.01). However, the increase of TNF-alpha level of pulmonary tissue was significantly reduced in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group ((5.9 +/- 0.56) pg/mg protein, P &lt; 0.01). Pulmonary IL-10 levels were elevated markedly in the vehicle + lipopolysaccharide group in contrast to that in the vehicle + saline group, whereas the elevation was augmented in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group. The nuclear localization of p65 increased markedly in the vehicle + lipopolysaccharide group and this enhancement of nuclear p65 expression was much less in the melatonin + lipopolysaccharide group.
A clone highly expressing APAO was obtained. High expression of APAO in A549 cells inhibited accumulation of CPENS, decreased their sensitivity to the toxicity of CPENS and prevented CPENS induced apoptosis.
In 86 cases (16.7%), of the 516 recipients, 106 episodes of acute rejection occurred, which included 9 with histopathological borderline changes, 36 Banff I rejections, 48 Banff II and 13 Banff III. Among these, 36 were cured by adjusting the dose of immunosuppressant and 65 were reversed by methylprednisolone pulse treatment. Five were methylprednisolone resistant, 3 of whom were given OKT3 treatment and 2 underwent liver retransplantation.
There was no conversion to open surgery in the LADG group and no postoperative mortality of any patients. There were no significant differences between LADG and ODG in operative time ((245 +/- 35) vs (220 +/- 20) minutes), complication rate (7.7% vs 10.0%), and number of lymph nodes (23.5 +/- 6.0 vs 21.0 +/- 7.5), while the blood loss was less after LADG ((110 +/- 25) vs (196 +/- 30) ml, P &lt; 0.05). The time to postoperative flatus and postoperative hospital stay were shorter after LADG ((73.0 +/- 8.5) vs (102.0 +/- 10.5) hours, and (8.6 +/- 1.2) vs (12.1 +/- 2.5) days, P &lt; 0.05, respectively).
Compared with controls ((100.27 +/- 22.44) ng/ml), plasma apoAV was decreased in SA patients ((76.54 +/- 16.91) ng/ml) but increased in patients with unstable angina ((330.89 +/- 66.48) ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05) or acute myocardial infarction ((368.66 +/- 60.53) ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05). Inverse correlations between apoAV and TG were observed in the control or stable angina groups (r = -0.573 or -0.603, respectively, P &lt; 0.001), whereas positive correlations were observed in the patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (r = 0.696 or 0.690, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, a positive relationship between apoAV and CRP was observed in the ACS patients but not in the non-ACS subjects.
After 12 months of therapy, cytogenetic response rate of the HHT, IFN-alpha and hydroxycarbamide groups were 39/106, 14/31 and 3/48, and corresponding molecular cytogenetic response rates 6/18, 3/8 and 0. Of the 17 patients who received HHT as salvage treatment, 6 achieved cytogenetic response (3 major). At the 48 months' follow-up, cytogenetic response was maintained in 32/39 patients treated with HHT. Patients who had cytogenetic response in HHT group or treated with IFN-alpha also showed longer median chronic durations, which were 45 months (12 months-98 months) and 49 months (12 months-92 months) respectively, indicating a longer survival time.
Totally 64 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Preoperative JOA score of ISI positive and negative group had significant difference, but the recovery ratios had no significant difference (the recovery ratios of the two groups in week 1, week 26, and week 104 were (21.54 +/- 14.65)%, (50.56 +/- 14.76)%, (59.23 +/- 13.08)% and (20.25 +/- 14.32)%, (54.46 +/- 23.16)% and (61.26 +/- 29.4)%, respectively; P &gt; 0.05). The recovery ratios of negative group and group A in week 104 were superior to group B (the recovery ratios of negative group, group A, and group B in week 104 were (61.26 +/- 29.49)%, (65.35 +/- 11.36)%, and (50.33 +/- 10.20)%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05).
Following 30 days of SERCA2a gene transfer in HF beagles its protein expression was significantly higher than in the HF group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Heart function improved along with the increase in SERCA2a expression. Left ventricular systolic function significantly improved, including the ejection fraction, left ventricular systolic pressure, maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (+dp/dt(max)), and the maximal rate of decline of left ventricular pressure (-dp/dt(max)) (P &lt; 0.05). Left ventricular end-diastole pressure significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of SERCA2a in the myocardial tissue was higher in the SERCA2a group than in the HF group (P &lt; 0.05).
When the concentration of gelatin was 1%, the diameters of particles were mostly about 100 microm, and the particle size was uniform. The envelope efficiency of low molecular weight heparin microcapsule was about 80%. The endothelialization of occluder in the model was more obvious in the coated group than in the uncoated group (P &lt; 0.0001).
Curcumin (both 100 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) and 300 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1)) significantly inhibited the behavioral seizure development in the (19.80 +/- 2.25) and (21.70 +/- 2.21) stimulations respectively required to reach the kindled state. Rats treated with 100 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) curcumin 30 minutes before kindling stimulation showed an obvious increase in the stimulation current intensity required to evoke AD from (703.3 +/- 85.9) microA to (960.0 +/- 116.5) microA during the progression to class V seizures. Rats treated with 300 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) curcumin showed a significant increase in the stimulation current intensity required to evoke AD from (735.0 +/- 65.2) microA to (867.0 +/- 93.4) microA during the progression to class V seizures. Rats treated with 300 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) curcumin required much more evoked ADs to reach the stage of class both IV (as (199.83 +/- 12.47) seconds) and V seizures (as (210.66 +/- 10.68) seconds). Rats treated with 100 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) curcumin required much more evoked ADs to reach the stage of class V seizures (as (219.56 +/- 18.24) seconds).
Remifentanil (0.1 - 1000.0 microg/L) decreased the [Ca(2+)](i) in a dose-dependent manner. It also decreased the amplitude of both transients dose-dependently. Furthermore, it increased the time to peak and t(50) of both transients dose-dependently.
At the end of the 4th week, stiffness coefficient, pressure strain elastic modulus and pulse wave velocity of femoral artery were significantly increased in group B compared with those in group A. Similarly, at the end of the 8th week, the same parameters of abdominal aorta were significantly increased in group B compared with those in group A. In contrast, stiffness coefficient, pressure strain elastic modulus and pulse wave velocity of femoral artery were significantly decreased in group C compared with those in group B, however, there was no significant difference in parameters of abdominal aorta between groups B and C.
The relative indicators of changes in histopathology, HA, LN, CIV, PCIII, Hyp, alpha-SMA and pp38 were raised significantly in the induced fibrosis group (P &lt; 0.01 vs normal group). The semiquantitative hepatic fibrosis staging scores of middle dose group and high dose group were decreased (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01 respectively vs the induced fibrosis group), as was the average area of collagen in rats' liver, the concentrations of serum HA, LN, CIV, PCIII and liver tissue homogenate Hyp. The gene expression of alpha-SMA mRNA was considerably decreased in the treated animals, as was the protein espression of pp38 protein.
High concentrations of HBV (1.2 x 10(5) - 5.0 x 10(5) copies/ml) or HBs (1.25 - 20 microg/ml) inhibited the proliferation of LX-2 cells, while low concentrations of HBV (1.0 x 10(3) - 6.2 x 10(4) copies/ml) or HBs (0.04 - 0.62 microg/ml) promoted the proliferation. After treating LX-2 cells with HBV for 72 hours, about 42 nm HBV-sized particles and strong expression of HBs and HBc were found in the cytoplasm of LX-2 cells. HBV-DNA in the culture medium of LX-2 cells decreased at 24 hours, rose at 48 hours and thereafter, decreased again at 72 hours. The mRNA and protein expression of cellular collagen type I in LX-2 cells were significantly increased by HBV infection but not by recombinant HBs.
The open-ended question revealed that in patients with low back pain, maintenance care appears to be offered to prevent new events. The rationale was to obtain optimal spinal function. There appears to be no common convention on the frequency of treatments and duration of the treatment program was not mentioned by any of the interviewees.
The mean population pharmacokinetic parameters were apparent systemic clearance (CL) 10.1L/h, apparent central volume of distribution 5.2 L, apparent peripheral volume of distribution 30.7 L, inter-tissue clearance 3.97 L/h, absorption rate constant 0.369 h-1 and lag-time 0.743 h. The covariate analysis identified creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) and bodyweight (WT) as individual factors influencing the apparent oral clearance: CL= 8.04 x (CL(CR)/89)(2.93) + 3.62 x (WT/28) L/h. The results of the simulation showed that for a typical patient (WT 28 kg and CL(CR) 89 mL/min), an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 43 +/- 10.6 mg x h/mL will be achieved with valganciclovir 500 mg once daily.
In total, 536 de novo renal allograft recipients were randomized in the CAESAR study. Of these, 114 patients were entered into the pharmacokinetic substudy and 110 patients contributed to the pharmacokinetic analysis. There was a rapid rise in MPA concentrations (median time to peak concentration 0.72-1.25 hours). At day 7 and month 3, the MPA AUC(12) values were similar in the cyclosporin withdrawal and low-dose cyclosporin groups (patients with the same cyclosporin target concentrations to month 6), while at 7 and 12 months, the values in the cyclosporin withdrawal group were higher than in the low-dose group (19.9% and 30.2% higher, respectively). MPA AUC(12) values in the standard-dose cyclosporin group were lower than in the other groups at all time points and increased over time. At all time points, the MPA peak plasma concentration was similar in all groups, and the MPAG concentrations rose more slowly than MPA concentrations. The ratio of the AUC from 6 to 12 hours/AUC(12) suggests that an increasing AUC in the cyclosporin withdrawal group is due to an increase in the enterohepatic recirculation.
In the final model, the deinduction process was accomplished by decreasing the rate of enzyme synthesis, resulting in a decrease in the relative amount of enzymes. The estimated rate constant for enzyme degradation was 0.00805 h-1, corresponding to a half-life of the combined enzymes of 86.1 hours (3.6 days).
To date, most positive and robust data are available for carbamazepine, however, pharmacokinetic interactions with secondary enzyme induction limit its use. Controlled data of valproate do not seem to support the use in this population. For oxcarbazepine only one controlled but negative trial is available. Positive small series and case reports have been reported for lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate.
Our knowledge on the epidemiology and risk factors of LLR relies on studies performed many years ago. All those studies and our personal observation agree on the fact that LLRs are followed by a systemic reaction in not a negligible proportion of patients (10-15%). More recent studies have underlined the possible role of specific immunotherapy, including sublingual, in the treatment and prevention of LLRs.
AGEP is a rare reaction pattern attributed mainly to drugs. Drug-specific T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and the production of interleukin-8/CXCL8 play an important role in its pathogenesis. A large-scale case-control study (EuroSCAR study) revealed a broad spectrum of drugs strongly associated with AGEP characterized by different time patterns (latent periods). Recent publications have supported the recognized role of individual drugs in the induction of AGEP and some have reported newly incriminated drugs. Many recent publications on AGEP have used the AGEP validation score (EuroSCAR group criteria) to establish the diagnosis. The value of in-vivo tests (mainly patch tests), in-vitro tests (the lymphocyte transformation test and cytokine release tests), or both for the identification of causative drugs has been demonstrated. Infections do not play a prominent role in the development of AGEP. There is no evidence for the assumption that AGEP is a variant of pustular psoriasis. Unique observations related to AGEP include a marked female predominance, a possible role for seasonality and a causal role for spider bites.
Rice is the most common solid food causing FPIES. Rice FPIES is associated with more severe reactions than other foods. Infants presenting acutely may be hypothermic (&lt;36 degrees C) and have thrombocytosis. Finding of hypoalbuminemia and weight gain less than 10 g/day helps to differentiate chronic infantile cow's milk FPIES from infectious causes. Gastric juice leukocytes more than 10 cells per high-power field are found in infants with positive oral food challenge to cow's milk.
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing type 1 and type 2 cytokines and endowed with cytotoxic properties are involved in nonimmediate allergic drug reactions. Recent studies have confirmed that CD8+ T cells play a major role in the pathophysiology of nonimmediate allergic drug reactions, and have characterized new cytotoxic molecular pathways responsible for the severity of the bullous forms of nonimmediate allergic drug reactions.
Mast cell products can neutralize major toxins of snake or bee venoms. beta-tryptase from mast cells is able to degrade allergens and IgE antibodies. Thus, mast cells and their mediators should protect patients from venom toxicity and should also lead to a decreased allergenicity. However, these theoretically beneficial effects of mast cells on downregulating allergic immediate type reactions are insufficient to protect patients with mastocytosis from severe anaphylaxis. In contrast, these patients are at an even higher risk. Many compounds of Hymenoptera venom can induce Fcepsilon receptor-independent mast cell degranulation. In the context of mast cell activation induced by Hymenoptera venom, FcepsilonRI-dependent stimulation of mast cells via bridging of specific IgE-antibodies may be of particular importance. Abundance and dysfunction of mast cells in patients with mastocytosis may explain a significant portion of the particularly high anaphylactic risk in patients with mastocytosis.
Intraepidermal CD8+T cells with an effector-memory phenotype resident in fixed drug eruption lesions have a major contributing role in the development of localized tissue damage. Activation of these CD8+T cells is sufficient for triggering the lesion, however, but not sufficient to cause extensive tissue damage observed in the fully evolved lesions; additional recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+T cells to a specific tissue site would also contribute to the late stage of lesion development. The influx of regulatory T cells into the epidermis observed in fully evolved lesions would serve to limit harmful immune reactions. Consistent with this, positive patch test reactions are only observed at the site of previous lesions harboring significant numbers of intraepidermal CD8+T cells.
Specialized intestinal antigen presenting cells are conditioned by spatial and soluble microenvironmental factors to promote tolerance to dietary antigen primarily via the induction of regulatory T cells. Retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, has been recently identified as a key environmental factor in this process.
There are many data showing that the DBPCFC poses a number of critical problems that are difficult to overcome in normal outpatient clinics and hospitals, and that are generally not addressed in most articles dealing with this issue.
The results obtained in terms of sensitivity and specificity with BAT are encouraging and in significant number of cases can establish the diagnosis.
Recent studies suggest an increase in prevalence of anaphylaxis in industrialized countries. Examination of the demographic characteristics of anaphylaxis has revealed potential approaches to better recognize those at greatest risk. Novel laboratory approaches to identify patients at increased risk of severe reactions have been suggested.
Seeking winter hibernation sites, ladybug swarms will invade human habitats in the fall. Large fall swarms and smaller spring dispersions produce corresponding peaks in ladybug allergy. Ladybug allergy prevalence in endemic areas has been reported as high as 10%. For some individuals ladybug allergy is their first expression of allergic disease. Exposures at home, work, school, and in other settings may be sensitizing. Ladybug hemolymph is the primary source of allergens. Har a 1 and Har a 2 major ladybug allergens have been characterized. 'Reflex bleeding' from tibiofemoral joints (for communication and during alarm) disperses these allergens.
Cellular assays have been evaluated in patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy. The diagnostic performance of the cellular mediator release test is similar to that of the flow cytometric basophil activation test (BAT), but the BAT has been the most intensively studied. BAT offers the possibility to assess basophil reactivity to allergens in their natural environment and to simultaneously analyze surface marker expression and intracellular signaling. It has been demonstrated that BAT represents a valuable additional diagnostic tool in selected patients when used in combination with other well established tests. A major limitation is the current lack of unified, standardized protocols. Flow cytometry offers huge possibilities to enhance knowledge of basophil functions.
The skin possesses not only multiple cytochrome P450 isoenzymes but also influx and efflux transporter proteins. The pattern of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the skin differs from the pattern in the liver. Studies on the role of this metabolism in drug-induced hypersensitivity have mainly focused on sulphonamides, anticonvulsants, diclofenac and nevirapine. Studies with the contact sensitizer carvoxime provided evidence for the decisive role of xenobiotica metabolism in antigen-presenting cells.
With the increase in consumption of NSAIDs, these have become one of the most common drugs inducing hypersensitivity reactions. Although cross-intolerance reactions are the most common, a significant proportion is selective responses. As specific IgE antibodies are not always found, there is only indirect evidence supporting an IgE-mediated mechanism in selective NSAID reactors.
Recent studies have suggested a potential role for sequential IgE-binding epitopes as biomarkers for characterizing various phenotypes of food allergy. Studies of allergens in milk, peanut, egg and wheat have shown a correlation between IgE sequential epitope diversity and patients' allergy severity or persistence. Several informative epitopes in milk allergens have been identified as candidate biomarkers to predict the development of tolerance to milk. However, limitations with current methods of IgE-binding epitope identification need to be addressed before they can be applied in the diagnosis/prognosis of food allergy.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published guidelines on the prevention and management of SSI. These guidelines follow a similar format to those published previously. There are, however, some important differences to previous recommendations and these are outlined in this current article. Other publications have provided additional evidence that suggests certain antiseptic agents are more efficacious than others for surgical hand antisepsis. Staphylococcus aureus decolonization has also been studied and noted to be of benefit for the prevention of SSI. Other research studies have focused on patient homeostasis, including the use of supplemental perioperative oxygen, which has resulted in mixed findings. Finally, the use of surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of 'care bundles' has been reported, which brings together many different approaches for the prevention of SSI.
New data are available, but the conflict surrounding the use of active surveillance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has not been resolved. The emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has prompted a greater interest in infection control strategies for prevention of their spread. Outbreaks of Clostridium difficile have responded to broad infection control initiatives, but further research is required to determine whether the best infection control precautions are being utilized.
A meta-analysis showed that the risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was increased by 1.8-fold in patients who had taken antibiotics. Such risk was almost three-times greater after using quinolones or glycopeptides. Significant heterogeneity between studies was mainly related to study designs. A Cochrane systematic review suggested that, although the quality of the evidence was poor, interventions to improve hospital antibiotic prescribing were associated with a reduction in the incidence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Against this evidence, mupirocin-resistant S. aureus and linezolid-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were detected in institutions where these drugs were not widely used. Studies assessing the impact of vancomycin prescribing restriction on VRE rates were heterogeneous and the effectiveness of such interventions remains poorly defined. Important confounders of studies, other than study design, are the lack of analysis of secular trends of infections, colonization pressure in the ward and duration of follow up.
Surveillance data are increasingly adjusted for risk factors for HCAI if meaningful comparisons are made between institutions or across national boundaries. Postdischarge surveillance is important in detecting those infections that may not present to the institution in which the original procedure occurred. Caution is urged when comparing data from two sources, for example, an active surveillance program and administrative datasets. The public reporting of HCAI rates can assist in improving the quality of healthcare, but to date there is little evidence that this is happening. In the United States, a number of states have introduced mandatory reporting of HCAIs, but there is considerable variation in what data are released, how these are reported and the rigor of the validation of the dataset.
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is exuberant and dysregulated inflammatory responses to invading microorganisms. It manifests when an abrupt shift of host immunity from an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive status towards a pathogenic proinflammatory state occurs as a result of rapid decreases or removal of factors promoting immunosuppression or inhibiting inflammation. In addition to HIV-infected patients, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has also been observed in solid organ transplant recipients, women during the postpartum period, neutropenic patients, and tumor necrosis factor antagonist recipients. Corticosteroids are the most commonly employed treatment, whereas other potential agents based on its pathogenesis deserve further investigation.
Recent prospective studies have confirmed the risk of tuberculosis reactivation posed by TNF antibodies to be several fold greater than soluble TNF receptor. Certolizumab pegol, a monovalent anti-TNF Fab' fragment appears to share this risk, despite its lack of Fc and its inability to cross-link transmembrane TNF. Screening and initiation of treatment for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection can greatly reduce the TB risk of anti-TNF treatment in western countries. However, alternative strategies to prevent TB because of new transmission may be required as these therapies become available worldwide. Current recommendations for withdrawal of anti-TNF therapy when TB is diagnosed place patients at risk for paradoxical worsening because of recovery of TNF-dependent inflammation. Recent case reports suggest reinstitution of TNF blockade may be safe and effective adjunctive treatment in such cases, but prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations.
The evolving epidemiologic characteristics of post-HSCT invasive mould infections, specifically the rising incidence of Aspergillus and non-Aspergillus mould infections in the postengraftment period, necessitate the development of preventive strategies. The efficacy of prophylactic broad-spectrum triazoles against invasive mould infections in HSCT recipients has now been demonstrated in two large prospective studies. However, concerns over drug absorption, interactions, and costs may shift attention from universal prophylaxis to risk stratification and preemptive strategies. In this regard, recent studies have highlighted the potential of genetic polymorphism analysis to identify HSCT recipients at risk for invasive aspergillosis, and efforts are underway to improve the predictive values of antigen and nucleic acid detection assays. Emerging data on risk factors for invasive aspergillosis relapse after HSCT, antifungal drug monitoring, and the use of galactomannan testing to monitor treatment response may help inform therapeutic decisions for HSCT recipients.
Major advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of invasive fungal diseases have occurred with the introduction of fungal markers and new antifungal agents over the past decade. The newer broad-spectrum azoles and echinocandins, due to their acceptable safety profiles and efficacy, have emerged as valuable options as antifungal prophylaxis and therapy. Empirical antifungal therapy, a strategy in which persistent neutropenic fever triggers the addition of an antifungal agent, remains a common practice. However, the development of fungal diagnostic markers (e.g. galactomannan and beta-glucan assays) combined with radiologic imaging has given potential to more targeted preemptive antifungal strategies.
A systematic review concluded that the relative risk reduction associated with the introduction of a sepsis bundle exceeded 25%, and absolute risk reduction exceeded 9% in all studies. The number needed to treat to save one life in each study population ranged from three to 11. Bundles for the prevention of infections have focused on ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-associated bloodstream infections in the ICU. The most persuasive evidence of effectiveness comes from multicentre studies, but results from single ICUs provide valuable insights into how bundle implementation fits within a broader quality improvement strategy.
The latest recommendations for VAP prevention stress the importance of implementing ventilator bundles and VAP-specific process measures such as hand hygiene in healthcare workers and regular oral care with a chlorhexidine antiseptic in patients. Isolated interventions such as aspirating subglottic secretions or the use of silver-coated endotracheal tubes have also achieved a reduction in the incidence of VAP. Improvement should be confirmed by active surveillance.
Physical and immunophenotypic characteristics of patient MSC were similar to healthy age-matched controls. However, an isolated in vitro differentiation defect toward adipogenic lineage was demonstrated in patient MSC and confirmed by low or absent expression of adipogenic transcripts (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, adipophilin, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, leptin and adiponectin) upon induction of adipogenesis. Following BM transplantation, minimal improvement in adipogenic potency of MSC was demonstrated by Oil Red O staining.
In a median of 26 days, 14 bags for adult patients and nine bags for pediatric patients for a standard dose of 1x10(6) hMSC/kg body weight could be prepared from the expansion of a fraction of the cells recovered from seven independent washouts. Moreover, 151 vials could be frozen from the remaining cells. The theoretical full expansion of all the frozen vials (validated by the expansion of two independent vials) could have allowed the production of 173 bags for adults and 348 bags for pediatric patients.
The average total MNC recovered from the BM in pediatric patients was 2.1 x 10(6)/mL and in older patients was 3.2 x 10(6)/mL. There were no differences in cell viability (&gt;97%) or phenotypic markers identifying T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils between the two groups. Of note, the Lin(-)CD34(+) cell population was not different between the groups. Average post-processing CFU-F, CFU-GEMM and BFU-E were not statistically different but there were significantly increased levels of CFU-GM in the older population.
Nicotine dose-dependently prevented the onset of EPC senescence in culture. Moreover, nicotine increased the proliferation of EPC and colony-forming capacity. Nicotine significantly increased telomerase activity and phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Moreover, pre-treatment with PI3K blockers, either wortmannin or LY294002, significantly attenuated the nicotine-induced telomerase activity. In addition, mecamylamine, a non-selective antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR), abrogated the effects of nicotine on EPC.
The median age was 55 years (range 19-74). The diagnoses were multiple myeloma (7), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7), Hodgkin's disease (4) and acute myeloid leukemia (1). The median cell content (CD34+/kg x 10(6)) was 1.1 (0.3-2.7) for BM, 1.2 (0.04-2.8) for PBPC and 2.2 (1.4-4.9) combined. Eight grafts contained &lt;2.0 x 10(6) CD34+/kg (1.4-1.8). The median engraftment in days (range) was: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500, 12 (9-39); Plt &gt; 20 000, 25 (15-70); RBC transfusion independence, 17 (6-93). Six patients died of progressive disease (58-293 days post-ASCT), one of infection on day 141 and one of AML on day 11. All patients except one maintained ANC &gt; 1000 without filgrastim support beyond day 19. One patient had cholecystitis and delayed graft failure on day 90. PBPC CD34+ content did not predict CD34+ BM content but correlated with ANC &gt; 500 (r= - 0.64, P=0.003). BM and combined CD34+ and BM TNC/kg did not correlate with engraftment or outcomes. Combined CD34+/kg &lt; or &gt; = 2.0 x 10(6) produced similar engraftment and mortality.
The PBSC samples frozen in CryoStor CS10 yielded significantly improved post-thaw recoveries for total viable CD34(+), colony-forming units (CFU) and granulocytes. Specifically, relative to the FHCRC standard formulation, cryopreservation with CS10 resulted in an average 1.8-fold increased recovery of viable CD34(+) cells (P=0.005), a 1.5-fold increase in CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (GM) numbers (P=0.030) and a 2.3-fold increase in granulocyte recovery (P=0.045).
After incubation with specific growth factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), UC MSC exhibited a high hepatic differentiation ability in an adherent culture condition. The differentiated UC MSC showed hepatocyte-like morphology and expressed several liver-specific markers at gene and protein levels. Furthermore, the DHC exhibited hepatocyte-specific functions, including albumin secretion, low-density lipoprotein uptake and urea production. More importantly, DHC did not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II antigen and were not able to induce lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte culture, as undifferentiated UC MSC did.
We found that rat MSC from different strains exhibited similar cell-surface phenotype. Expansion rates and differentiation capacities of the MSC were also similar across the different strains. Co-culture of rat MSC with spleen cells obtained from rats of a different strain did not induce proliferation of immune cells.
The intramuscular (i.m.) administration of PLX-PAD in our model significantly improved blood flow (BF) (P=0.0008), increased capillary density (P=0.021), reduced oxidative stress (P=0.034) and reduced endothelial damage (P=0.004), while increasing limb function versus the administration of a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control vehicle in the affected limb.
PMVEC apoptosis under HSS and serum starvation conditions was significantly inhibited by EPC conditioned medium (CM). It was attenuated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A or -B blocking. EPC CM promoted PMVEC proliferation, which was weakened by VEGF-A or interleukin (IL)-8 blocking. The EPC CM caused less apoptosis of PMVEC induced by HSS plus pro-inflammatory factors. The anti-apoptotic effect of EPC CM was attenuated by blockade of either vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 or -2. However, the pro-proliferating effect appeared to be weakened only by VEGFR-2 blocking. Both Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were enhanced by EPC CM. VEGFR-2 blockage led to significant inhibition of Erk1/2 and Akt activation; VEGFR-1 blockage only of Erk1/2 activation. Human-origin VEGF co-localized with incorporated EPC in small pulmonary arterioles, and EPC transplantation resulted in down-regulation of caspase-3 expression.
FST was up-regulated in hMSC after ES and was associated with cardiomyogenic differentiation of hMSC by short-term ES.
Macroscopically, the encapsulated complex solid and multiloculated cystic tumor with large calcification, focal thickened walls and filled with yellow-tan gelatinous material. Microscopically, the tumor showed coexistent mature cystic teratoma, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumor. Immunohistochemically, alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A-racemase, calretinin, CD10 and thyroid transcription factor-1 were negative in all the three components of the tumor. The teratomatous cysts lined by ciliated epithelium showed strong staining for cytokeratin 7 and pancytokeratin, and those lined by colonic-like epithelium showed strong staining for CDX2, cytokeratin 20 and pancytokeratin, but both were negative for calretinin. Additionally, the teratomatous cyst wall showed strong staining for smooth muscle actin, and weak staining for carbonic anhydrase IX, CD99, chromogranin and synaptophysin. The adenocarcinoma component was strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and pancytokeratin, weakly positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and negative for carbonic anhydrase IX, CD99, CDX2, chromogranin, cytokeratin 20 and smooth muscle actin. The carcinoid tumor component was strongly positive for CD56, chromogranin and synaptophysin, weakly positive for pancytokeratin, and negative for carbonic anhydrase IX, CD99, CDX2, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 and smooth muscle actin. She received no adjuvant therapy and is alive without evidence of disease six months after diagnosis and surgery.
Expression of p-AKT was significantly (P = 0.036) associated with a higher relapse risk in multivariate analysis. Low expression of M2PK was non-significantly (P = 0.065) predictive for a higher risk. TKTL-1 and GLUT-1 were expressed in the majority of cases, albeit not associated with relapse risk.
Pathogenic organisms can be cultured only in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. These conditions should be treated with antibiotics, usually fluoroquinolones, for an adequate period of time. 90% of patients with prostatitis syndrome, however, suffer not from bacterial prostatitis but from chronic (abacterial) prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). It remains unclear whether CP/CPPS is of infectious origin, and therefore the utility of a trial of antimicrobial treatment is debatable. Treatment with alpha receptor blockers is recommended if functional subvesical obstruction is documented or suspected. Symptomatic therapy for pelvic pain should be given as well.
The six main considerations for study design are the question to be answered, the study population, the unit of analysis, the type of study, the measuring technique, and the calculation of sample size.
More than 300 000 people in Germany suffer from chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The incidence and prevalence of IBD have risen in the past 10 years, particularly for Crohn's disease. Every fifth IBD patient is a child or adolescent. A better understanding of key events in the inflammatory cascade, e.g., the activation and polarization of T cells by TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12/18 through dendritic cells, has led in recent years to the development of many new immune-modulating and biological treatments. Advanced endoscopic techniques and contrast-enhanced tomographic imaging techniques have expanded diagnostic capabilities.
The level of evidence was found to be very low. No guidelines, systematic reviews or meta-analyses are available, and there have been only three randomized, double-blind trials of treatment for epilepsy in the elderly. The seizures often escape clinical attention, because premonitory symptoms (aura) and secondary generalization into tonic-clonic seizures are both rarer in older patients. On the other hand, sudden loss of consciousness from various causes becomes more common with increasing age, presenting a challenge in differential diagnosis. Treatment is often more complex because of comorbidities and multiple other drugs, and requires a cautious approach. Drug interactions, in particular, require special attention. On the positive side, epileptic seizures in the elderly seem to be more easily controlled by medications than they are in young adults.
Patients with GO evaluated their QoL lower than healthy individuals, which referred to physical functioning, physical and emotional role functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health and bodily pain. No correlation was found between quality of life and such factors as age, sex, or duration time of Graves disease and ophthalmopathy. Analogically, no relation was observed between the activity and stage of clinical development of eye changes and QoL. The use of the combined GO therapy contributed to a considerable decrease in the development of eye changes and the disease activity. After treatment, the patients' QoL improved which referred to physical role functioning, bodily pain, and vitality. Other QoL parameters did not statistically significantly differ.
We found that adiponectin inhibited the growth of HECa 10 line at all examined concentrations in the 24-hour culture, with moderate potency. There were no dose- or time-response effects. In the 72-hour cell culture, adiponectin inhibited the growth with the same or weaker potency and we did not observe its inhibitory effect at 10(-12)M concentration. There was no beneficial interaction between adiponectin and thalidomide. In this study, however, thalidomide alone did not cause any inhibitory effect on this cell line.
The genetic study revealed that the CC genotype was observed in 15.56% of subjects, the CG genotype in 52.74%, and the GG genotype in 31.7%. IL-6 and CRP concentration did not differ among the genotypes. There were also no differences regarding BMI and WHR. The only differences among genotypes, observed only in men, were those concerning total fat (CC had higher fat content than CG and GG); the difference being statistically significant between CC and GG (p &lt; 0.05), and gynoidal fat deposit (CC had higher gynoidal fat deposit than CG and GG); the difference being statistically significant between CC and GG (p &lt; 0.025) and between CC and CG (p &lt; 0.05). Biochemical parameters and insulin sensitivity did not differ among the genotypes.
In NTS group lower basal 25-OH-D(3) serum levels (22.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 30.9 +/- 2 ng/ml; p = 0.02), while in CNT group higher PTH (22.7 +/- +/- 2.2 vs. 15.6 +/- 1.9 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.05) levels were found. Both NTS and CNT patients showed an exaggerated response of PTH secretion to the Pi load (as expressed as the AUC) as compared with GK [757 +/- 51.7 vs. 790 +/- 53.8 vs. 600 +/- 39 (pg/ml)*24 h]. In addition patients in groups NTS and CNT showed a higher calciuria than GK (2.48 +/- 0.2 and 2.42 +/- 0,2 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.2 mmol/d.) and a delayed normalization of plasma P at the day of the Pi load.
The duration of the clinical history ranged from 2 months to 16 years. The most frequent symptoms were: hypertension paroxysmal and constant, palpitations, headache, sweating and anxiety. The most sensitive diagnostic method was increased concentration of urinary metanephrine in 24-hour urine. Computed tomography was the most widely used method for tumor localization. Adrenal pheochromocytoma was detecting by CT in all patients, predominated in right adrenal, in 1 case in urinary bladder. Surgery caused remission of hypertension in 59%, improvement in 26.8%, and no changes in 13.9% of patients. Malignancy was reported in 2 cases, 1 woman died after surgery. MEN 2A occur in 21.6%.
EC-SOD plasma activity was significantly higher in women with subclinical hyperthyroidism when compared with the control group (13.3 +/- 2.1 vs. 10.9 +/- 1.4 NU/ml; p &lt; 0.05), unlike Mn-SOD (4.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.0 +/- 1.0 NU/ml). MDA plasma concentration increased significantly in women with subclinical hyperthyroidism (3.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.6 micromol/l; p &lt; 0.05).
A total of 43,241 escalator/stair-choice observations were made. Stair use increased significantly from 3.58 to 4.93% during the intervention period of 1-2 weeks for all subjects. In addition, stair use had a significantly high value of 5.80% during the intervention period of 3-4 weeks. Stair use also increased in subgroups during the intervention periods with the exception of women 65 and older. Attempts to publicize the study had no effect on the increase in stair use.
All dampness indicators except for visible mold in bathrooms had significantly higher odds ratios (ORs) for all or any SBS symptoms after adjustment. The dampness index, the number of positive dampness indicators, was significantly related to all SBS symptoms after adjustment.
School children suffered from various discomforts/problems during classwork because of the school furniture. Anthropometric dimensions of the school children were found to increase with age, but most of the dimensions of the school furniture in different grades (V to X) remained more or less the same. The school children were found to change postures frequently while using such classroom furniture.
In the structural equation model, the standardized regression weights for the path from BMI to BMD of all sites were 0.273-0.434. Conversely, the BF% to BMD of the total body and left arm were -0.192 and -0.296, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, the FM index (FMI) was significantly associated with the BMD of the lumbar spine as a weight-bearing site. The LTM index (LTMI) was significantly associated with the BMD of the total body and left arm as a non-weight-bearing site.
Concentrations in teeth in the modern females (n = 5) were 1.2 +/- 0.5 mug/g (n = 5) for Pb; 1.7 +/- 0.2 ng/g for Hg; 0.9 +/- 1.1 mug/g for Cu; 150 +/- 24.6 mug/g for Zn. The levels of Pb were highest in the teeth samples obtained from the humans of the Edo era (1603-1868 AD: ) (0.5-4.0 mug/g, n = 4). No trend was observed in this study in the Hg content in teeth during 3,000 years. The concentrations of Cu were highest in teeth of two medieval craftsmen (57.0 and 220 mug/g). The levels of Zn were higher in modern subjects (P &lt; 0.05) than those in the Jomon (~1000 BC: ) to Edo periods [113.2 +/- 27.4 (mug/g, n = 11)]. Reconstruction of developmental exposure history to lead in a famous court painter of the Edo period (18th century) revealed high levels of Pb (7.1-22.0 mug/g) in his childhood.
Average personal exposure of the children and elderly to PM(2.5) was 80.5 +/- 29.9 and 20.7 +/- 12.7 mug/m(3), respectively. Mean urinary MDA level in the children and the elderly was 3.6 +/- 1.9 and 4.0 +/- 1.6 mumol/g creatinine. For elderly subjects the PM(2.5) level was significantly associated with urinary MDA after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, passive smoking, day-care facility site, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and medical history (heart disease, hypertension and bronchial asthma). However, there was no significant relationship for children.
The concentrations of 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD (hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF (pentachlorodibenzofuran), 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF, and three dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels (PCDDs-TEQ, PCDFs-TEQ, and total-TEQ) in maternal breast milk were inversely correlated to newborn length even after adjustment for gestational weeks, infant sex, and maternal age and height. These isomers were abundant among the 17 isomers tested and reflected the TEQ levels. Only 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD), the most toxic isomer, was negatively correlated with newborn head circumference, even after adjustment for gestational weeks, infant birth weight, and other confounding factors.
We assumed that TB patients and 59 susceptible subjects stayed for 150 days in a room where the air-exchange rate was five per hour. Using the estimated median R (A) of 44.14, the TB infection rate was 74.6%. This result was similar to the epidemiological report that the TB infection rate among employees in the Internet café was 70%. The median R (A) increased linearly as the number of days of exposure increased. The slope of the change in median R (A) divided by the change in the number of days of exposure increased exponentially as air-exchange rate decreased; thus air ventilation in a facility may be essential to prevent TB infection.
Caries incidence and the average number of carious teeth (decayed/missing/filled teeth, dmft) for infants aged 1.6 years were significantly higher in the rural area than in the urban area, indicating that environmental factors that predispose infants to develop dental caries exist in the rural area. In addition, logistic regression analysis for infants in each of the two areas revealed that risk factors of the child-care environment, for example living with grandparents and brushing by parents, stood in marked contrast with each other. Moreover, the odds ratio of the risk factor dozing off while drinking showed a marked difference between the areas, although this risk factor was common in both areas.
The daily living performance score sheet had good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82 and a sequential hierarchical structure that reflected the difficulty of the activities. The total score was significantly and positively associated with six of eight subscale scores on the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (P &lt; 0.01). In the follow-up study, every one-point decrease in total score was significantly associated with a 39% elevated risk of a stumble or fall (P = 0.022) and also borderline significantly associated with higher risks of a fall, anxiety while walking indoors, and anxiety while walking outdoors (P &lt; 0.10).
Although the EMG analysis could not clearly demonstrate any reduction of physical load to the low back, the flexion angles of the hip and knee joints of student subjects during the patient-handling task became larger and that of the trunk became smaller in the group given the educational intervention.
After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and health factors, elderly who were either married or living alone were less likely to encounter ADL decline compared to their counterparts. This was true only for those with fully independent ADL at baseline. Notably, once the functional status of the elderly declined from baseline and they became dependent on others, the status of living alone was no longer a significant predictor of the rate of future decline. On the other hand, elderly who had a spouse, children or other relatives as caregivers were more likely to experience a faster recovery and lower likelihood of death, compared to those who were cared by unrelated live-in caregivers. In addition, Chinese elderly with health insurance had a lower likelihood of death than their counterparts lacking health insurance, among those with ADL at the dependent baseline.
Of the 846 students, aged between 6 and 15 years, enrolled in the study and screened by ultrasonography, 37 children were diagnosed as having NAFLD (score &gt;/= 1). There was a significant sex difference in the prevalence of NAFLD(P = 0.003). The trend test revealed a strong dose-response relationship (P &lt; 0.001) between pediatric NAFLD and the number of the proposed components of pediatric metabolic syndrome in Japan (MetS-JC), such as a clustering of the components of MetS-JC. Additionally, the linear trend of the odds ratios (ORs) with increasing percentile of the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). However, when WC was added to the logistic model, the ORs were no longer significant, whereas WC turned out to be an independent risk factor for NAFLD regardless of the HOMA-IR index.
The overall prevalence of ADHD symptoms was 2,349/7,566 (31.1%) in the parent survey and 431/9,956 (4.3%) in the teacher survey, with a prevalence ratio of 7.2 (95% CI: 6.5-7.9). Likelihood ratio test indicated that variables significantly associated with the presence of ADHD symptoms were gender, age, school type, interaction between gender and observer, and interaction between school type and observer (each with P &lt; 0.0001).
Nine years following the baseline measurements, 1907 subjects had recovered from at least one risk factor. When there was initially a single risk factor, a good overall lifestyle was effective in the recovery [odds ratio (OR) 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.57], with maintaining good dietary habits (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.07, 1.45) and moderate stress levels (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.38) both found to be especially effective in the recovery. When there were multiple risk factors, although the effect of a good overall lifestyle on the recovery was less than that when there was only a single risk factor, non-smoking (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.07, 1.51) and limiting working hours (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.05, 1.49) were found to be effective.
Both a significant association between the 3-PBA concentration and the frequency of tomato consumption and a significant positive linear trend was found in female subjects. In contrast, no such association was found in the male subjects.
ICCs for seven phthalate metabolite concentrations in single spot urine samples were: MMP (0.57), MEP (0.47), MnBP (0.69), MBzP (0.28), MEHP (0.51), MEHHP (0.43), and MEOHP (0.41) in 12 pregnant women. Phthalate ester metabolites had high detection rates in 50 subjects. The mean daily intake ranged from 0.01 to 2 mug/kg per day. The daily intake levels in all subjects were lower than corresponding tolerable daily intake (TDI) set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), though maximum value for DnBP of 6.91 mug/kg per day accounted for 70% of TDI value.
Based on data for 35 patients who could gait at discharge and 19 patients who could not, a model including MAT, HDS-R, and the New York Heart Association classification of cardiac function scores (P &lt; 0.001) was obtained using multiple logistic regression analysis (discriminant hitting ratio: 94.4%).
For the female subjects, the mean cycling time, subjectively assessed as a means of transport, was significantly longer in the group with a high GIS score for the number of land use types, while the score for total number of walking steps was significantly higher among those who were aware of places to walk to, and cycling time for transport was longer for those who perceived an accessibility to post offices, banks/credit unions, gymnasiums/fitness facilities, and amusement facilities in their neighborhood. For the male subjects, the score for walking time for leisure was longer for those who perceived aesthetics and an accessibility to parks, and the score for total walking steps was significantly higher for those who perceived an accessibility to bookstores or rental video stores in their neighborhood.
The results obtained from this action-research project consist of a set of tangible elements, among which (1) a conceptual data model adapted to the Romanian specificities regarding water resources management (needs, data availability, etc.), (2) a related spatial relational database (objects and attributes in tables, links, etc.), that can be used to store the data collected, among others, by the water administration, and later on exploited with geographical information systems, (3) a toolbar (in the ESRI environment) offering the requested data processing and visualizing functionalities. Lessons learned from this whole process can be considered as additional, although less tangible, results.
At most sampling locations, the heavy metal concentrations in soil decrease with increasing distance to the presumably major source of pollution. Highest heavy metal concentrations were found in 10-20 cm soil depths. There were also decreasing heavy metal concentrations for atmospheric deposition with increasing distance to the industrial site. In surface and groundwater samples, traces of zinc, copper and lead were detected.
Important concentrations of POPs were identified only in sediments at river mouths (sites S5 and S6). Along the year, the sum of PCB concentrations ranged between 3 and 10 ng/g dw (S5), and between 4 and 26 ng/g dw (S6). Concentration of HCHs ranged between 0.4 and 3 ng/g dw (both S5 and S6) with a higher contribution of the gamma-HCH (30-70%), followed by beta-HCH (20-50%). The beta-HCH isomer was found at lower concentrations or even not detected in outer city sites. DDTs were found at higher concentrations than HCHs and ranged between 0.18 and 4 ng/g dw (S5) and between 0.56 and 18 ng/g dw (S6). The parent compound, p,p'-DDT, could be detected only in low concentrations (up to 5 ng/g dw) and contributed with less than 30% to the sum of DDTs in sediment. The principal contributors of the SigmaDDTs in sediment were p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDD. The o,p'-DDD and DDT isomers were minor contributors to the sum of DDT. PAHs were found at higher concentrations than DDTs and ranged between 6 and 36 ng/g dw (S5) and between 36 and 155 ng/g dw (S6). Fluoranthene was predominant (up to 40%), followed by phenantrene (up to 30%), naphthalene (up to 35%), and benzo-(g,h,i)-perylene (up to 23%). The saprobity index and the diatom index increased from springs to river mouth, indicating a decrease in the water quality, but within the limits of moderate pollution. The saprobity index varied between 1.99 at spring to 2.70 at mouth. The diatom index varied from 3.48 to 3.14. The species' richness in phytoplankton has a less clear pattern along the river, but in general, it appears to be negatively influenced by pollution. At the level of biological consumer species, the analyses of the macroinvertebrates confirm the situation and the tendency shown with algae. In addition, the Shannon-Wiener index, the Pielou evenness index, and the McNaughton dominance index indicate a peculiar pattern: invertebrate communities appear to a have a more stable structure along the river, with visible shifts at springs and at river mouths. Water toxicity testing indicates low toxicity of river waters around the city of Iasi, with two notable exceptions: the point pollution at the domestic wastewater treatment discharge and at the old open-air deposit of domestic solid wastes. Another important result was that tested algae appeared to be more readily affected than tested cladoceran: EC(50) (percent effluent) was 16 in algae and 28 in cladocerans. The slope of toxic effect was also much steeper in cladocerans (6) than in algae (1.8), which means that the toxic effect is more sudden on the tested invertebrates than on the tested algae.
Under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which came into force in May 2004, governments are required to develop a National Implementation Plan (NIP) setting out how they will address their obligations under the convention and how they will take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment by the use of best available techniques (BAT) and application of best environmental practices (BEP). On a European level, the WFD has been in place as the main European legislation to protect our water resources and the water environment of Europe since 2000. It requires managing river basins so that the quality and quantity of water does not affect the ecological services of any specific water body. Nevertheless, the goals of other directives as for drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater treatment are not yet harmonised mainly concerning microbiological, priority substances and priority hazardous substances (PS/PHS) contamination. Following the detection of substances, a risk assessment with sound effect data needs to be performed also for regulatory decisions and priorisation of measures to remove emerging contaminants. Beside personal care products and industrial contaminants, faecal pollution of recreational waters is one of the major hazards facing users, although microbial contamination from other sources as well as chemical and physical aspects also affects the suitability of water for recreation. As in arid and semiarid areas, wastewater is considered for irrigation with regulatory needs of hygienic and chemical parameters-health-based targets-to avoid the contamination of crops and food. In surface waters, currently, the relationships between physical and chemical properties and the biological state of surface waters were quite well-understood to enable the management of catchments and rivers to achieve ecological quality.
The median UIC of the children (n=857) was 125 microg/l (range 11-757 microg/l). The proportion of children with a UIC &lt;100 microg/l was 30.0% and the proportion of children with a UIC &lt;50 and &gt;300 microg/l was 5.5 and 3.0%, respectively.
'Extra' foods contributed to 36% of daily energy intake with the highest contributors being fried potatoes (2.8%), margarine (2.6%), cakes and muffins (2.5%), beer (2.4%), sugar-sweetened soft drinks (2.4%), and meat pies (2.2%). Both age and sex were important determinants of 'extra' foods intake; younger adults were more likely to consume sugar-sweetened soft drinks, fried potatoes, meat pies and savoury pastries, pizza, crisps, lollies and chocolate; whereas older adults were more likely to consume sweet and savoury biscuits, cakes and muffins, margarine and butter. In all age groups, 'extra' foods contributed more to energy intake for men than women. Overall, 'extra' foods contributed 16% protein, 41% total fat, 41% saturated fat, 47% sugar and approximately 20% of selected micronutrients to the diet.
All the new indices were highly correlated with body mass index, percentage of fat and fat cell size. Subcutaneous thicknesses were greater in women, while internal-coronal and sagittal diameters, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and internal circumference area were greater in men (P&lt;0.001). Those observations were reinforced by the adipocyte size in both fat depots. Subcutaneous parameters showed the strongest correlation with metabolic alterations, being positively associated with metabolic risk in women and negatively in men. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the best predictor index was the superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (SSAT) and its relation to visceral area (SSAT/VAT), explaining 42% of total variance for high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in men and 26% for homeostasis model assessment in women. After receiver operating characteristic-curves analysis, three threshold values for both sexes were proposed to select the most appropriate depending on the clinical situation.
The high GI diet resulted in significantly higher glucose and insulin mean incremental areas under the curve (IAUC, P=0.027 and P=0.001 respectively). CCK concentration was 59% higher during the first 7 h of the low GI diet (394+/-95 pmol/l min) vs the high GI diet (163+/-38 pmol/l min, P=0.046), but there was no difference over 10 h (P=0.224). GHR concentration was inversely correlated with insulin concentration (Pearson correlation -0.48, P=0.007), but did not differ significantly between the low and high GI diets.
In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin concentration was positively associated with child's age, mother's age, household's socioeconomic stratum, and family income. Low ferritin was related to 3.6 g/l lower hemoglobin concentration (95% confidence interval=-6.0, -1.3). Unexpectedly, we found an inverse trend in hemoglobin concentration by quartiles of erythrocyte folate; the adjusted hemoglobin concentration difference between the highest and lowest folate quartiles was -6.0 g/l (95% confidence interval=-7.2, -4.9; P for trend &lt;0.0001). This difference was greatest among children with vitamin B12 concentration &lt;148 pmol/l (-11.5 g/l), followed by children with vitamin B12 concentration 148-221 pmol/l (-7.7 g/l), and smallest in children with vitamin B12 concentration &gt;221 pmol/l (-5.7 g/l); P for interaction=0.04.
Compared with placebo, consumption of psyllium lowered serum total cholesterol by 0.375 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.257-0.494 mmol/l), and LDL cholesterol by 0.278 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.213-0.312 mmol/l). With random-effect meta-regression, a significant dose-response relationship were found between doses (3-20.4 g/day) and total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol changes. Regression model of total cholesterol was -0.0222+0.2061 x log (dose+1), and that of LDL cholesterol was 0.0485+0.1390 x log (dose+1). There was a time effect of psyllium on total cholesterol (equation: 6.3640-0.0316 x treatment period) and on LDL cholesterol (equation: 4.3134-0.0162 x treatment period), suggesting that psyllium reduced serum total cholesterol more quickly than LDL cholesterol.
Values of BMI (P=0.034), sum of skinfold thicknesses (STs) (P=0.021), body fat mass (BFM) (P=0.023), percentage of overweight subjects (P=0.007), serum triacylglycerols (P=0.012) and nail selenium (P=0.001) were significantly different between subjects above and below the median of serum C3 concentrations. The following correlations with serum C3 were identified tricipital ST (P=0.033), sum of STs (P=0.012), BMI (P=0.008), BFM (P=0.018), waist-to-height ratio (P=0.016), serum glucose (P=0.045), serum triacylglycerols (P=0.001) and nail selenium (P=0.006). Circulating C3 showed a positive association with several adiposity markers such as BMI (P=0.001), waist circumference (P=0.006), waist-to-height ratio (P=0.002), BFM (P=0.025), as well as serum glucose (P=0.027) and triacylglycerols (P&lt;0.001), whereas nail selenium was a statistically significant negative predictor of C3 concentrations (P=0.018).
Serving sizes, defined by the US Food and Drug Administration as reference amounts customarily consumed (RACC), were inversely linked to energy density of foods. Positive subscores based on 100 kcal were equivalent to those calculated using RACC values. Negative subscores performed better when based on 100 g as opposed to 100 kcal.
There were no differences between the three groups of underweight patients with respect to anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) variables with the exception of phase angle. The latter was significantly higher in dancers, lower in anorectic patients and not different in constitutionally lean patients, as compared with controls.
Total abdominal fat on CT did not differ between boys and girls (86.5 versus 89.8 cm(3), P=0.84). Boys had a higher IAAT to SAAT ratio than girls (0.56 versus 0.37, P=0.03). The sum of supra-iliac and abdominal skinfolds was most strongly correlated with SAAT on CT (r=0.93, P&lt;0.001), and the abdominal skinfold with IAAT on CT (r=0.72, P&lt;0.001). Diagnosis of subcutaneous abdominal and intra-abdominal adiposity can also be made using skinfolds. The associations with circumferences, body mass index and DEXA were less pronounced; however, these techniques can also be used to classify children according to SAAT and IAAT. Ultrasound can be used to diagnose subcutaneous adiposity, although it was not superior to skinfold measurements.
There were 50 and 51 subjects left in LCT and MLCT groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in daily intake of energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate, as well as the daily physical activity between the two groups during the study. After 8 weeks, MLCT group showed a significant decrease in body weight, BMI, WC, HC, ratio of WC and HC, body fat, body fat percentage and subcutaneous fat when compared with the initial values. The decrease in body weight, BMI, WC, body fat and subcutaneous and visceral fat was significantly greater in MLCT group than that in the LCT group. Furthermore, the serum concentrations of TG in MLCT group were significantly lower than those in the LCT group.
We observed no significant differences in overall diarrhoea incidence among treatment arms. Stunting modified this effect with stunted HIV-uninfected children having significantly lower diarrhoea incidence when supplemented with zinc or multiple micronutrients compared with vitamin A alone (2.04 and 2.23 vs 3.92 episodes/year, respectively, P=0.024). No meaningful subgroup analyses could be done in the cohort of HIV-infected children.
The results showed a strong correlation between oral breathing and malocclusions, which manifests itself with both dentoskeletal and functional alterations, leading to a dysfunctional malocclusive pattern.
CF patients showed a mean DMFT (1.5 +/- 2.17) and dmft (0.42 +/- 0.9) significantly lower than control subjects (respectively 3.70 +/- 3.92 and 2.96 +/- 3.30). Moreover, in the CF subjects a high prevalence (55.6%) of enamel defects and a better periodontal health were found, despite the low presence of calculus in both groups.
At the time of the survey, 1.1% of subjects were wearing an orthodontic appliance, 36.1% had definite need (DHC 4 or 5) for orthodontic treatment, 20.2% borderline need (DHC 3) and 43.8% showed slight or no need for treatment (DHC 1 or 2). Reviewing the AC scores, 17.9% of the studied subjects showed definite need (AC 8-10) for orthodontic treatment, 36.1% borderline need (AC 5-7) and 46% showed slight or no need for treatment (AC 1-4). The prevalence of the four most severe occlusal traits in those with definite orthodontic treatment need were: severe maxillary crowding (43.6%), increased overbite (39.1%), increased overjet (35.8%) and severe mandibular crowding (27.4%). No gender differences were found for AC (P&gt;0.05) and DHC (P&gt;0.05) of IOTN index.
Comparing the enamel characteristics (ground or intact) only when SE was used a statistically significant difference was found, as G2 (21.12+/-4.52) was statistically lower than G5 (33.29+/-5.44). Among the intact enamel groups, SB (26.11+/-7.56) was statistically superior to SE (21.12+/-4.52) and OBF (17.01+/-3.96). However, when comparisons were made among groups of ground enamel, SE (33.29+/-5.44) was significantly higher than SB (26.35+/-8.18) and OBF (17.52+/-3.46).
There was statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.0001) between chronologic and dental age in cleft patients. The mean dental development delay in UCLP was 0.34 years and for BCLP was 0.61 years. BCLP patients were found to have a greater delay than UCLP patients (P&lt;0.05). Girls showed an advanced dental development in both types of clefts. Comparison between the two cleft groups showed only significant difference in the amount of delay in female subjects.
Postoperative care was uneventful. The patient did not suffer from neurological deficiency. After three years of follow-up, the patient survived without any cancer recurrence.
We have found that young, 1-month-old female BALB/c mice are resistant to the induction of PGIA, but with aging they become susceptible. PG-induced T cell responses decline with age, whereas there is a shift toward Th1 cytokines. An age-dependent decrease in T cell number is associated with an increased ratio of the memory phenotype, and lower CD28 expression. Antigen-presenting cells shifted from macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells in young mice toward B cells in older mice. The regulatory/activated T cell ratio decreases in older mice after PG injections indicating impaired regulation of the immune response.
Forty-seven out of 71 (66%) tumor tissue specimens were positive for cyclin A and twenty-six (37%) were positive for cyclin E. In the majority of cases, nuclear staining was apparent. Cyclin A and cyclin E expression was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma (cyclin A: Chi(2) Yates'a 4.6; p=0.032; cyclin E: Chi(2) Yates'a 5.12: p=0.023). The prognostic value of cyclin A and E expression was examinated in all patients and in patients with squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma and separately for every stage, but no correlations were found.
Dairy, but not supplement, decreased weight gain and percent body fat in HF mice, with no effect on food consumption. Dairy improved insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, while supplement increased bone mineral density in LF mice. Dairy had no effect on bone.
The growth inhibitory dose (ID50) of the compounds ranged from 12.64 to 20.62 mug/ml. Methylprototribestin was the most effective resistance modifier. However, methylprotodioscin, pseudoprotodioscin, prosapogenin A of dioscin, tribestin and 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid showed moderate MDR reversal activity. In a checkerboard method, methyloprototribestin and the mixture of the 3 acetylated isomers enhanced the antiproliferative effects on MDR cells in combination with doxorubicin.
Male and female rats that received 4 mg/kg or more of PTX at 0 days of age developed cataracts and retinal dysplasias, while the rats that received other dosing regimens did not develop ocular lesions. Epithelial cells in the lens were apoptotic on day 1, and lens fibers were degenerative at day 7, indicating the development of cataracts. Scattered foci of apoptosis in the neuroblastic layer of the retina on day 1, and rosettes were seen on day 7, suggestive of retinal dysplasia.
The postoperative morbidity rate was 45% (27 patients); surgical morbidity was observed in 19 patients and medical complications in 9 cases. No postoperative deaths were observed. The survival data, 53 patients were analized (the last 7 were considered only for the complications rate, postoperative mortality and cancer features, not for OS or PFS because they were too recent for evaluation). At the final follow-up of the 53 patients, five and ten years OS were respectively 94% and 84.6% . DFS was 80% and 70% at five and ten years respectively. The follow-up data indicated that the survival probability may be good in patients with hystological type appendicular adenoma optimally cytoreduced (CCR-0). Interestingly if preoperative chemotherapy was performed represented a negative prognostic factor with statistically significant impact both on OS and DFS.
Serum growth hormone glucose and cortisol were found elevated at the 10th and 30th minute and at the end of EBBLA. Serum prolactin increased only at the 30th minute. Of notice, none of the measured parameters was found elevated one hour after the end of biopsy. Concerning adrenaline, noradrenaline and interleukins, no significant changes were documented.
The PhV exhibited a mean transvalvular pressure gradient of less than 15 mmhg and a mean regurgitant fraction of less than 5 percent. It also demonstrated a resistance to migration of up to 6 N and a resistance to crushing of up to 25 N at a diameter of 19 mm. The PhV was crimpable to less than 24 F and was delivered into the operating Lhs via a 24 F catheter.
The microcapsules withstood well the shear stress induced by high agitation rates. The microcapsules were permeable to albumin, but prevented the release of immunoglobulins. Culture in roller bottles of immortalized human hepatocytes immobilized in the AC microcapsules improved cell growth, albumin synthesis, ammonia elimination and lidocaine clearance as compared with free cells cultured in roller bottles.
Microaggregate formation induced by the incubation of heparinized whole blood with polysulfone (PS) HD membranes was effectively inhibited by alpha-tocopherol and glycyrrhizin. alpha-Tocopherol, but not glycyrrhizin, was found to inhibit PS membrane-induced P-selectin expression on the platelet surface; however, glycyrrhizin did inhibit both the formation of neutrophil-platelet microaggregates induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the adhesion of HL60 leukemic cells to P-selectin-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, suggesting that glycyrrhizin acts as a competitive inhibitor of P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. Finally, these compounds almost completely abrogated PS membrane-induced and platelet-dependent ROS production by neutrophils.
Study subjects were mainly low-income (82%), african-american (73%), men (75%); 16 were manual laborers and 9 worked in the industrial sector. Study subjects reported low levels of Occupational Stress: ERI scores indicated an imbalance between Job Efforts and Rewards in only 3 subjects. Nevertheless, ERI scores were inversely and strongly associated with WAI (rho=-0.41, p&lt;0.012) and all QoL scales even after adjustment for known confounders.
Showed improved outcome with preservation of the limbs or devices involved.
Medical staff had largely similar views on the percentage of patients for which a component of 'good death' was achieved. All the achievement ratings determined in the present study were considerably lower than the necessity ratings given by non-medical staff in a previous study. There were differences among medical staff with respect to their contribution to achieving a component of 'good death' and the concrete means they would use to achieve a 'good death'.
The CBT group reported a positive change in their approach to patients. Nurses felt empowered, more skilled and effective not only to assess and support patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression but also to facilitate change. In addition, nurses placed considerable value on being given a psychological model and set of interventions.
This approach was a positive learning experience within clinical practice that enabled the group to develop their knowledge of audit planning, design, analysis and reporting as well as their problem-solving, written and communication skills.
Mean heart rates and mean 15-m sprint times remained unchanged across the three bouts of the LIST. Following the LIST slalom dribbling time increased significantly by 4.5+/-4.0% (P=.009), while the mean total points scored during the LSST was significantly reduced by 7.6+/-7.0 points (P=.012). When fatigued the frequency of shots in the LSST achieving the highest score of 5 points was reduced by 47% while the frequency of shots achieving the lowest 0 point score increased by 85%.
Performance times on the IAR (TE 0.27 s, 1.8%, 90% CI 0.21 to 0.37 s; LOA -0.12 s+/-0.74; LPR slope 1, intercept -2.8) and SCODS (TE 0.18 s, 1.5%, 90% CI 0.14 to 0.24 s; LOA 0.05 s+/-0.49; LPR slope 0.95, intercept 0.5) were reproducible. There were no statistically significant differences in performance time between squash (14.75+/-0.66 s) and nonsquash players (14.79+/-0.41 s) on the IAR. Squash players (10.90+/-0.44 s) outperformed nonsquash players (12.20+/-0.34 s) on the SCODS (P&lt;.01). Squash player rank significantly correlated with SCODS performance time (Spearman's rho=0.77, P&lt;.01), but not IAR performance time (Spearman's rho=0.43, P=.21).
Similar pacing-profiles were evident in each event, which were characterized by an initial acceleration followed by a progressive decay in split times. In the 1-km TT, the first 250-m split time was a primary determinant of total time, whereas the rate of fatigue over the remainder of the race did not discriminate between performances. The first 250-m split time was also related to total time in the 3- and 4-km IP, although to a lesser extent than in the 1-km TT, whereas the ability to maintain a consistent pacing-profile was of increased importance. There were differences in the pacing strategies of slow and fast performances in the 3- and 4-km IP, with slow performances characterized by an overly quick start with a concomitant slowing at the finish.
The National Squad players scored significantly better (ie, distance covered) in the MSST and WIST than the National League players (effect sizes=1.60 to 1.79, P&lt;.001). The MSST and WIST scores were significantly correlated (r=.80 to 0.88, P&lt;.001). The MSST scores were significantly correlated with peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak; mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) obtained for all tests (r=.58 to 0.59, P&lt;.05). In contrast, there were no significant correlations between the WIST scores and VO2peakobtained for any of the tests (r=.43 to 0.52, P&gt;.05). Differences in VO2peakfor the IST, MSST and WIST were nonsignificant (P&gt;.05).
Statistical analysis using limits of agreement and correlation indicated a high level of agreement between the two [Bla] samples for all five test stages (agreement&gt;95%, confidence intervals [CI]=-0.5 to 1.5, r=.97, P&lt;.05).
MRS, step rate, contact time, and step time were improved significantly in a 35-m sprint test for the U+D group (P&lt;.01) after training by 4.3%, 4.3%, -5.1%, and -3.9% respectively, whereas the H group showed smaller improvements, (1.7% (P&lt;.05), 1.2% (P&lt;.01), 1.7% (P&lt;.01), and 1.2% (P&lt;.01) respectively). There were no significant changes in the C group. The posture characteristics and the peak anaerobic power (AWT) performance did not change with training in any of the groups.
Subjects completed 2 more reps when they perceived they had ingested caffeine. RPE was significantly (P=.04) lower in the perceived caffeine and control conditions and RPE for the active muscle was significantly higher across all conditions compared with RPE for the overall body. No substantial differences were evident in PHR across conditions.
No differences (P=0.73 to 0.95) in peak power during repeated sprints were present between conditions. Postexercise MVC was reduced (P&lt;.05) in both conditions and a moderate effect size (d=0.60) indicated a slower percentage MVC recovered by 60 min in the heat (83+/-10 vs 74+/-11% recovered). Both heart rate and core temperature were significantly higher (P&lt;.05) during recovery in the heat. Capillary blood values did not differ between conditions at any time point, whereas sessional RPE was higher 60 min postexercise in the heat.
The bowler's mean workload per ODI was 8+/-2 overs (mean+/-SD). He covered a total distance of 15.9+/-2.5 km per game; 12+/-3% or 1.9+/-0.2 km was striding (0.8+/-0.2 km) or sprinting (1.1+/-0.2 km), whereas 10.9+/-2.1 km was spent walking. One high-intensity (running, striding, or sprinting) repetition (HIR) occurred every 68+/-12 s, and the average duration of a HI effort was 2.7+/-0.1 s. The player also completed 66+/-11 sprints per game; mean sprint distance was 18+/-3 m and maximum sprinting speed 8.3+/-0.9 m.s(-1).
On the basis of fecal Baermann test results, prevalence of infection was 13.8%. Sensitivity (NPV) of tests was as follows: Baermann technique on minced lung tissue, 81.8% (97.2%); fecal flotation-sedimentation, 63.6% (94.5%); stereomicroscopic examination of BAL fluid combined with cytologic examination of BAL fluid, 54.5% (93.2%); stereomicroscopic examination of BAL fluid alone, 45.4% (92.0%); cytologic examination of BAL fluid alone, 36.4% (90.8%); histologic examination of lung tissue, 45.4% (91.8%); and gross lung appearance, 36.4% (90.8%). Specificity and PPV of all tests were 100%, with the exception of histologic examination of lung tissue (specificity, 97.1%; PPV, 71.4%), which identified infected cats that had negative fecal Baermann test results.
56 (35%) dogs and 19 (44%) cats had successful CPCR. Twelve (6%) animals (9 dogs and 3 cats) were discharged from the hospital. Successfully resuscitated dogs were significantly more likely to have been treated with mannitol, lidocaine, fluids, dopamine, corticosteroids, or vasopressin; had CPA while anesthetized; received chest compressions while positioned in lateral recumbency; and had a suspected cause of CPA other than hemorrhage or anemia, shock, hypoxemia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cerebral trauma, malignant arrhythmia, or an anaphylactoid reaction and were less likely to have been treated with multiple doses of epinephrine, had a longer duration of CPA, or had multiple disease conditions, compared with findings in dogs that were not successfully resuscitated. Successfully resuscitated cats were significantly more likely to have had more people participate in CPCR and less likely to have had shock as the suspected cause of CPA, compared with findings in cats that were not successfully resuscitated.
Percentage of dogs and cats admitted from 12:00 noon to 4:00 PM on Sundays during NEP games (mean GIR, 1.7) versus non-NEP games was not different. Mean +/- SD percentage of dogs and cats admitted from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM on Sundays during NEP games (mean GIR, 2.4) versus non-NEP games was significantly different (18 +/- 5% and 25 +/- 7% of daily caseload, respectively). Percentage of dogs and cats admitted from 8:00 PM to 12:00 midnight on Sundays during NEP games (mean GIR, 2.1) versus non-NEP games was not different. Game type (NEP vs non-NEP) during emergency room admission did not influence whether dogs and cats subsequently were hospitalized, died, or were euthanatized.
Severe diffuse esophagitis, esophageal dysmotility, and a benign esophageal stricture at the level of the base of the heart were identified via contrast videofluoroscopy and esophagoscopy. Severe diffuse eosinophilic ulcerative esophagitis was confirmed by histologic examination of esophageal biopsy specimens and cytologic evaluation of specimens obtained by use of a cytology brush. Esophageal eosinophils were evident (14% to 50% of the inflammatory cell population and &gt; 25 eosinophils/hpf).
No clinical or endoscopic improvement was evident after treatment with antireflux medications, including a proton-pump inhibitor, following an initial esophageal bougienage procedure. An excellent response characterized by resolution of dysphagia and regurgitation with marked improvement of the esophageal mucosa was evident following intralesional and systemic administration of glucocorticoids, 2 additional esophageal bougienage procedures, and feeding of an elimination diet.
Physical examination of the rabbit revealed bilateral conjunctivitis, hypersalivation, and severe signs of CNS dysfunction such as incoordination, intermittent myoclonic seizures, and opisthotonus. Results of hematologic and serum biochemical analyses revealed only lymphopenia, a relative monocytosis, and an increase in serum activity of creatine phosphokinase and serum concentration of total protein. Serum antibodies against Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Toxoplasma gondii were not detected.
Despite IV administration of crystalloid fluids and treatment with antimicrobials, vitamin B complex, nutritional support, and prednisolone, the condition of the rabbit deteriorated; it was euthanized 7 days after admission. Histologic evaluation of brain tissue revealed lesions characteristic of severe, diffuse, nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis and a few large, eosinophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies in neurons and glial cells. The DNA of human herpesvirus-1 was detected in the nuclei of glial cells, lymphocytes, and neurons by means of in situ hybridization. The rabbit's owner, who reported having had a severe labial and facial herpesvirus infection 5 days before the onset of clinical signs in the rabbit, was suspected to be the origin of infection for the rabbit.
Radiographic and arthroscopic findings were in agreement with respect to both number and location of fragments in 21 of the 48 (44%) joints. Ultrasonographic and arthroscopic findings were in agreement with respect to number and location of fragments for 46 of the 48 (96%) joints. In the remaining 2 joints, arthroscopy revealed additional fragments that were not identified ultrasonographically. When ultrasonographic findings were compared with radiographic findings, more fragments were seen ultrasonographically in 3 joints and fewer fragments were seen ultrasonographically in 1 joint. Ultrasonographic findings also confirmed the absence (4 joints) or presence (3 joints) of fragmentation at the dorsoproximal aspect of the joint that had been suspected on the basis of radiographic findings. Ultrasonography was also able to determine the location of the fragments in the joints where this was not possible radiographically.
Horses were substantially more likely to develop EIPH (severity score &gt;or= 1; odds ratio, 3.3 to 4.4) or moderate to severe EIPH (severity score &gt;or= 2; odds ratio, 6.9 to 11.0) following administration of saline solution than following administration of furosemide. In addition, 81 of the 120 (67.5%) horses that had EIPH after administration of saline solution had a reduction in EIPH severity score of at least 1 when treated with furosemide.
Coping strategies suggested by 242 euthanasia technicians were summarized into 26 distinct coping recommendations in 8 categories: competence or skills strategies, euthanasia behavioral strategies, cognitive or self-talk strategies, emotional regulation strategies, separation strategies, get-help strategies, seek long-term solution strategies, and withdrawal strategies.
Twenty isolates were identified as A. baumannii and were all highly resistant to 38% of the antibiotics tested and the majority of isolates were also resistant to 50% of the remaining antibiotics. four strains had low-level meropenem resistance (MIC 4-8 mg/l). All isolates were sensitive to imipenem and colistin. Nine strains possessed four novel bla( OXA-51-like )genes encoding beta-lactamases designated OXA-90, OXA-130, OXA-131 and OXA-132, and four strains contained bla(OXA-131 )with ISAba1 upstream of the gene structure. PFGE showed five separate clusters of OXA-51-like enzymes and the dissemination of strains carrying the four novel enzymes was clonal. this study showed that new strains of A. baumannii characterised by their new bla(OXA-51-like )gene have emerged. No genes encoding OXA-23-like, OXA-40-like, or OXA-58-like beta-lactamases were found. Surveillance of A. baumannii harbouring the bla( OXA-131-like )gene may be an essential step in monitoring their carbapenem resistance phenotype and may assist in preventing their spread in diabetics.
Isolated capillaries as well as 7-day old PBCECs showed expression of BCRP. Cell sensitivity to mitoxantrone significantly increased in the presence of the BCRP inhibitors KO143 and GF120918. Transport of mitoxantrone across PBCEC monolayers was directed with P(app) (apical to basolateral) 5.6 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) and with P(app) (basolateral to apical) 2.8 x 10(-5) cm s(-1). FACS analysis revealed a different extent of fluorescence accumulation dependent on the kind and concentration of BCRP modulating compounds.
An inadequate bowel preparation was reported in 28.2% of observed colonoscopies. In multivariate regression analysis, age greater than 60 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-7.4], a history of diabetes (OR 8.6, 95% CI 6.3-19.4), a history of appendectomy (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.0-10.5), a history of colorectal resection (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4-17.6), and a history of hysterectomy (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.4) were independent predictors of an inadequate colon preparation.
The response rate was 63% in the GI group and 45% in the non-GI group. The 2 groups were of similar age and level of physical activity. The frequency of musculoskeletal injury was higher in the GI group (74% vs. 35%; P&lt;0.001). The most common sites of injury among the GI group were the thumb (19%), low back (19%), hand (17%), and neck (10%). There was no significant association between volume of endoscopy or years performing endoscopy and injury. Most of the GI group made modifications in their endoscopic practice to reduce injury risk.
Good-quality images were obtained in both controls and patients, with optimal visualization of the anatomic structures and pathologic features. The latter (abscesses, fistulas) were always confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.
The frequency of IL-10-1082 G carriers was higher in cases of a diffuse type GC [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-3.1, P=0.041] or BGU (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5, P=0.040), than in the control group regardless of Helicobacter pylori infection. The IL-8-251 A/A genotype was more common in H. pylori-positive patients with GC (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.6, P=0.013) or BGU (OR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.5-4.8, P=0.001) than in H. pylori-positive controls. In addition, the frequencies of IL-6-572 G/G (OR 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9, P=0.027) and of G carriers (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8, P=0.003) were lower in H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer patients than in H. pylori-positive controls. IL-10-592 C/C (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, P=0.028) was an independent factor associated with a decreased risk of the intestinal type of GC by multivariate analysis. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed between IL-10-592 A/A and IL-8-251 A/A with respect to the development of GC or BGU.
A prevalence rate of a positive reflux symptom score (13.1%) was significantly higher in obese children than in the control group (2%) (odds ratio: 7.3, 95% CI: 1.7-31). Obesity remained as the only significant predictor for a positive reflux symptom score after controlling for other variables such as age, sex, race, and caffeine exposure (adjusted odds ratio: 7.4, 95% CI: 1.7-32.5). A positive reflux symptom score increased significantly from 2% in the control group to 11.7% in 196 obese children to 20% in 40 severely obese children (with BMI z-score &gt;2.7).
Twenty patients: M:F 18:2; mean age 52.4 years; genotype 1: 18, non-genotype 1: 2. Of the 20 patients, 5 withdrew before starting treatment. Of the 11 patients who reached 3 months, 6 had early virologic response, defined as at least a 2-log drop in their HCV count (54.5%). Of the 5 patients who were treated for 1-year, only 1 patient had a response 12 weeks after treatment. Side effects included 4 cases of anemia and 1 patient with headache.
PTVE was successfully performed in 89 of 92 patients, providing a procedural success rate of 96.7%. According to the distribution of injected 2-OCA, 3 types of variceal embolization were defined, esophagogastric obliteration (n=42), gastric obliteration (n=34), and main left gastric vein obliteration (n=13). Acute variceal bleeding was immediately arrested in all 18 (100%) patients after the procedure. During the median follow-up period of 37 months, the total rebleeding rate was 19.1% (17/89), with the rate being higher in patients with main left gastric vein obliteration 46.1% (6/13) than in patients with esophagogastric obliteration 9.5% (4/42) or with gastric obliteration 20.6% (7/34, P&lt;0.05). Total survival rate was 74.4%, with the rate being significantly higher in patients with esophagogastric obliteration and gastric obliteration than that in patients with left gastric vein obliteration demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P&lt;0.001, log-rank test). There was 1 patient with fatal bleeding at the puncture site after the PTVE procedure, and 1 patient with slight pulmonary embolism; there were no other major procedure-related complications.
A positive SAP for cough was noted in 7/26 patients reporting symptoms on the day of monitoring. Compared with SAP-negative patients, SAP-positive patients had both a greater number [median (interquartile range), 5(2 to 8) vs. 2(0 to 4), P&lt;0.05] and a higher proportion of reflux episodes crossing the UES into the pharynx [25%(14% to 28%) vs. 7% (2% to 14%), P&lt;0.02]. There was no difference in the number of reflux episodes or acid exposure time in the distal esophagus between SAP-positive and SAP-negative patients. Only 1% to 2% of episodes were detected by the pharyngeal pH sensor.
Baseline host and viral factors were not significantly different among the 4 groups. High PIVKA-II groups (P and H) had more aggressive tumor characteristics (larger size of tumors, higher number of tumors, frequent portal vein thrombosis, P&lt;0.05) and much shorter median survival time than low PIVKA-II groups (L and A) (P&lt;0.05). In multivariate analysis, high PIVKA-II level was an independent predictor for survival (risk ration: 2.377, 95% confidence interval: 1.359-4.157, P=0.002) together with Child-Pugh score, advanced TMN stages, and treatment modality. Even after excluding 33 patients who had Child-Pugh class C and advanced tumor stages (tumor-nodes-metastasis stage III-IV) at diagnosis, high PIVKA-II level was still an independent predictor for survival (risk ration: 4.258, 95% confidence interval: 2.418-8.445, P&lt;0.001).
Single nucleotide polymorphisms within each of 3 haplotype blocks across the IL-23R gene were associated with an increased risk of CD. Notably, the minor allele of the IL-23R R381Q variant was present in 2.9% of cases and 6.0% controls (P=0.0001, odds ratio=0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.69). Homozygosity for the minor (T) allele of the ATG16L1 T216A polymorphism was strongly protective for CD (P=0.0001, odds ratio=0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.68). No phenotypic associations were detected and no interactions between the genes to increase disease risk were established.
After bile duct stenting, 98% of patients had a positive bile culture, whereas only 21% of infected bile was seen in patients without drainage (P&lt;0.001). Despite infected bile, only 2% stented patients developed acute cholangitis postoperatively, versus 13% patients in the group without stent (P=0.231). After stenting, major complications occurred in 12%, versus 8% in patients without stent (P=0.817).
Statistical analysis using nonparametric McNemer tests showed that supplemental buccal and lingual infiltration of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine or 4% articaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine improved the success rate from 33% to 47% and 67%, respectively. Also the success rate with 4% articaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was significantly more than 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine (p &lt; 0.05).
A significantly higher success rate was found for endodontic surgery at 2-4 years (77.8%) compared with nonsurgical retreatment for the same follow-up period (70.9%; P &lt; .05). At 4-6 years, however, this relationship was reversed, with nonsurgical retreatment showing a higher success rate of 83.0% compared with 71.8% for endodontic surgery (P &lt; .05). Insufficient numbers of articles were available to make comparisons after 6 years of follow-up period. Endodontic surgery studies showed a statistically significant decrease in success with each increasing follow-up interval (P &lt; .05). The weighted success for 2-4 years was 77.8%, which declined at 4-6 years to 71.8% and further declined at 6+ years to 62.9% (P &lt; .05). Conversely, the nonsurgical retreatment success rates demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weighted success from 2-4 years (70.9%) to 4-6 years (83.0%; P &lt; .05).
Some 19% and 39% of teeth in the NR and HF group, respectively, were judged to have some form of procedural errors. A higher rate of periapical healing was noted for NR (77%) than the HF group (60%) (p &lt; 0.05). Factors contributing favorably to treatment outcome included the use of rotary technique, maxillary molar, experienced operator, and absence of preoperative radiolucent lesion.
Regardless of age, females had significantly shorter vertical distances from the IAN to the mesial (P &lt; .01) and distal apices (P &lt; .01) and shorter horizontal distances for total width of mandibular bone at the mesial (P &lt; .01) and distal apices (P &lt; .01). In addition, the overall width of the mandibular bone decreased in both genders from the 3rd-6th decade of life (P &lt; .01).
Bacteria were detected more consistently and at higher levels in root ends. Periradicular lesions exhibited a diverse microbial profile with many uncultivated phylotypes. Enterococcus faecalis and Burkholderia cepacia predominated in both samples. Campylobacter gracilis and Streptococcus gordonii were associated with root ends, whereas Atopobium rimae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus genomospecies C8, Dialister sp E2_20 E1, and Eubacterium strain A35MT were associated with periradicular lesions.
Pain predominantly occurred in the maxilla (14 patients). In 10 patients (62.5%), NTP developed after retreatment. Daily application of tricyclic antidepressants produced pain relief in 11 patients (68.8%).
The accuracy of the Root ZX II, Apex NRG XFR, and Mini Apex Locator in locating the minor diameter within +/-0.5 mm was 50%, 46.43%, and 39.29%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the EALs in locating the minor diameter. The determination of WL by using hand files in the control teeth was more accurate.
The response rate was 46%. Univariate, bivariate, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Fifty-seven percent of respondents supported endodontists placing implants. Currently 5.7% of respondents place implants. Regression analyses identified the following variables as being positively associated with endodontists placing implants: graduation from an endodontic training program &gt;or=10 years ago (p = .002); interest in placing implants in the future (p = .0001); the belief that implant placement should be incorporated into the endodontic residency curriculum (p &lt; .0001); the belief that general dentists would support endodontists placing implants (p &lt; .0001); and the desire to continue the rapport with a referred patient by placing an implant if the patient's tooth is nonrestorable (p &lt; .0001).
Laser treatment resulted in significant improvements of discomfort immediately after treatment and after 1 week. At the 2-, 3-, and 4-week examination, the discomfort in group fluoride decreased up to nearly 75% to 85% of baseline scores, whereas the effect of the laser stayed nearly unchanged. The visual analog scale scores for pain at 4 weeks examination were significantly lower in the fluoride group compared with those in the laser group (p &lt; 0.05).
TLR-2 messenger RNA was detected at 3 hours after bacterial infection and then gradually increased from 9 to 24 hours. Numerous TLR-2- and CD64-positive cells detected on macrophages and dendritic-like cells, and TLR-4- and CD64-positive macrophages were detected in the early stage of pulpitis.
The proportion of killed bacteria was depended on the type of irrigant and the time of exposure in both C-HA and HA biofilm models (p = 0.00). CHX-Plus showed higher levels of bactericidal activity at all exposure times than 2% CHX (p &lt; 0.001). The C-HA biofilm was thicker than the HA biofilm. Less bacteria were killed in C-HA biofilm than in the HA model.
The root canal isolate accounted for 37.4% of the biofilm and 31.9% of the planktonic phase when examined by the culture technique, whereas the proportions examined by FISH showed 15.3% in the biofilm and 11.7% in the planktonic phase. The saliva isolate (as examined by the culture technique) accounted for 32.4% in the biofilm and 27.1% in the planktonic phase, respectively, compared with 14.1% in the biofilm and 9.5% in the planktonic phase when examined by FISH analysis.
MAP-1B is specifically expressed in odontoblasts from adult third molars as well as incisor germs from human embryos. In adult carious teeth, it is also expressed in newly differentiated dentin-forming cells. In vitro, MAP-1B expression is related to the differentiation state of odontoblasts. MAP-1B clearly underlines the cellular architecture of cell bodies and processes of differentiated cells. FMRP, MAP2, and tau are also detected in vivo.
The level of SLPI expression increased strongly 30 minutes after the LPS treatment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed many extensions of the cytoplasmic processes after LPS stimulation. SLPI was expressed along the dentinal tubules and odontoblasts layer in rat teeth after an artificial wound. SLPI also inhibited the LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB in MDPC-23.
Among 44 teeth, a total of 132 initial files were inserted into 83 orifices, in which 42 orifices had only one initial file, 33 with two, and 8 orifices had three files inserted. Eight main canals were not located because of canal bifurcations in the root, calcification, and dentin fusion.
PR detected AP in 71% of roots, a CBCT scan detected AP in 84%, and AP was histologically diagnosed in 93% (p = 0.001). Overall, sensitivity was 0.77 and 0.91 for PR and CBCT, respectively. Specificity was 1 for both. Negative predictive value was 0.25 and 0.46 for PR and CBCT, respectively. Positive predictive value was 1 for both. Diagnostic accuracy (true positives + true negatives) was 0.78 and 0.92 for PR and CBCT (p = 0.028), respectively.
The results showed approximately a 30% reduction in the observed number of cycles to fracture as rotational speed was increased from 300 to 600 RPM (p &lt; 0.05). The morphology of the fractured surface was always of ductile type, and no plastic deformation was observed on the helical shaft of fractured instruments.
Positive controls had both dye and bacterial penetration. Negative controls had no dye or bacterial penetration. All KS restorations debonded, whereas 18 KSSB restorations (60%) debonded. KS restorations were 1.67 times more likely to debond than KSSB restorations (Fisher exact test). KS was 1.3 times more likely to have dye penetration than KSSB (Fisher exact test) and 3 times more likely to have bacterial penetration, although not statistically significant (chi(2) test). Overall, 88.3% of specimens had dye penetration, and 20% had bacterial penetration. This 68.3% difference indicated no association between dye and bacterial penetration (exact McNemar test).
Groups treated with 5.25% NaOCl, whether associated or not associated to 17% EDTA, presented a significantly different birefringence pattern compared with the control group. The results revealed that groups irrigated with 2% CHX and EDTA, independently or combined, did not present any significant differences compared with the control group. SEM analysis showed structural alterations of the root canal inorganic matrix for all groups that used 17% EDTA.
The stage 1 experiment showed that collapsing cavitation bubbles using HIFU delivered plaster beads along the entire length of the tubular channel. It was observed from the stage 2 experiments that the diffusion of fluids alone was not able to deliver antibacterial nanoparticles into dentinal tubules. The collapsing cavitation bubbles treatment using HIFU resulted in significant penetration up to 1,000 microm of antibacterial nanoparticles into the dentinal tubules. The statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference in the depth of penetration of antibacterial nanoparticles between the two groups (&lt;0.005).
The quantitative analysis showed significant statistical difference only among groups (P &lt; .001). Comparing the weakened/restored groups, composite light-exposure time did not influence the results. Overall, adhesive failures occurred more frequently than other types of failures. Cohesive failures occurred only in the weakened/restored roots.
The results of this study show that ultrasonic agitation was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05, Tukey test) from the control. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05, Tukey test) between the ultrasonic agitation and the use of EndoActivator, F-File, and sonic agitation. Ultrasonic agitation was significantly more effective at removing bacteria than needle irrigation and EndoVac irrigation (p &lt; 0.05, Tukey test).
Backscatter scans showed that the accumulated debris viewed in the microCT scans was consistent with root dentin. In the selected canal segments, 29.2% +/- 14.5% of the original canal volume was filled with accumulated debris, which represented a significant change from the preoperative scan (p &lt; 0.01, one-sample t test against zero). Three-dimensional reconstructions of the microCT images visualized the accumulated hard-tissue debris in the whole canal system.
AH Plus/gutta-percha root fillings showed significantly higher push-out bond strength than both Resilon/Epiphany and Resilon/Epiphany SE (P &lt; .05). There was no significant difference between Epiphany/Resilon and Epiphany SE/Resilon (P &gt; .05).
Fresh iRoot SP killed all bacteria in 2 minutes, AH Plus in 5 minutes, EndoRez in 20 minutes, and Sealapex and Epiphany in 60 minutes. Freshly mixed Apexit Plus and Tubli Seal failed to kill all bacteria at 60 minutes. For 1-day and 3-day samples, iRoot SP and EndoRez had the strongest antibacterial activity, followed by Sealapex and Epiphany; Tubli Seal and AH Plus did n'ot show any significant antibacterial activity. Of all the samples, Apexit Plus had the lowest antimicrobial activity. The pH of the sealers could not alone explain their antibacterial effect.
Mean mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and palatal canal volumes increased after preparation (P &lt; .05), but differences were noted for preparation techniques. GT rendered the smallest (0.20 +/- 0.14 mm(3)); K-files and ProFile showed the largest volume increases (0.51 +/- 0.20 mm(3) and 0.45 +/- 021 mm(3), P &lt; .05). All canals were slightly rounder in the apical 4 mm after preparation indicated by nonsignificant increases in structure model index. Untreated areas ranged from 4%-100% and were larger in mesiobuccal and palatal canals than in distobuccal ones. Preparation with GT left significantly larger untreated areas in all canal types (P &lt; .05); among root canal types, distobuccal canals had the least amounts of untreated surface areas.
During root canal treatment, type IV and V configurations as defined by Vertucci of the palatal canals of two first and two second maxillary molars were identified. After mechanical instrumentation, the canals were obturated. Radiologic and clinical re-evaluation showed no signs of inflammation.
The manner in which HIV tests were offered to junior doctors varied both between and within the NHS trusts. Overall, the doctors were highly critical of the way the HIV test was offered. Recurrent themes surrounding a lack of discussion and information regarding the indications for the test and implications of a positive result influenced the the doctors' perception of their experiences. As a consequence of the shortcomings of how the test was offered, most of the doctors held the misperception that HIV testing was mandatory and many felt unable to decline the test. The majority of doctors referred to patient protection as adequate justification for being offered an HIV test.
Patients believed that respecting persons incorporates the following major elements: empathy, care, autonomy, provision of information, recognition of individuality, dignity and attention to needs.
Four domains of vulnerability derived from Kipnis's taxonomy were identified and included: (i) communicative vulnerability, represented by participants impaired in their ability to communicate because of distressing symptoms; (ii) institutional vulnerability, which referred to participants who existed under the authority of others--for example, in hospital; (iii) deferential vulnerability, which included participants who were subject to the informal authority or the independent interests of others; (iv) medical vulnerability, which referred to participants with distressing medical conditions; and (v) social vulnerability, which included participants considered to belong to an undervalued social group. Participants from both ethnic groups populated all these domains, but those who were black Caribbean were more present among the socially vulnerable.
The results indicate that parental problem drinking is associated with significant mental health consequences for children that persist far into adulthood. Adult respondents with a problem-drinking father were more likely to have been diagnosed with mental health problems relative to other respondents, while those with a problem-drinking mother had poorer self-perceived health and mental health (SF-12) scores. Respondents with a problem-drinking mother were also more likely to have ever been diagnosed with a mental health problem. Outcomes were worse for daughters of problem drinkers than for sons.
The results indicate the presence of some countries in two extreme groups. On the one hand, countries with the best performance in the field of mental health have the best mental health infrastructure and are also ranked first in science and technology in this area. On the other hand, countries with the worst performance in the field of mental health also have the worst mental health infrastructure and are in the worst position in science and technology.
During the study period, altogether 25,738 visits took place, the total number of visitors being 10,265. Of these visitors, 1,360 had mental health or drinking problems totalling to 4,471 visits. Most of these visits took place to mental health clinics or were visits made as home care. The average cost of mental health work in primary care per client was 29.8 in two weeks, ranging between municipalities from 29 to 52 . Client's poor GAF and being a recipient of home care were associated with higher costs of services. Even after controlling for visitor-related factors, use and costs of services were associated with the local service patterns.
We estimate that persons with depression have about the same out-of-pocket expenditures while having 11.8% less total medical expenditures (not a statistically significant difference) compared to non-depressed individuals with at least one chronic disease.
After a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 96 patients developed cerebrovascular disease (55 strokes, 31 TIAs, and 10 with both TIA and stroke; median age = 52 years). Most ischemic events were from large-artery atherosclerosis (36%) or cardioembolisms (24%). The standardized incidence ratio for stroke was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7 to 2.8), and for TIA, it was 3.1 (95% CI = 2.2 to 4.2). The risks remained elevated, compared with those in the general population, after prolonged follow-up. The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke or TIA 30 years after Hodgkin lymphoma treatment was 7% (95% CI = 5% to 8%). Radiation to the neck and mediastinum was an independent risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular disease (hazard ratio = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.6 vs without radiotherapy). Treatment with chemotherapy was not associated with an increased risk. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with the occurrence of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, whereas smoking and overweight were not.
MCPyV DNA was present in 91 carcinomas (79.8%). Compared with MCPyV DNA-negative cancers, MCPyV DNA-positive cancers were more often located in a limb (40.7% vs 8.7%, P = .015) and less frequent in patients who had regional nodal metastases at diagnosis (6.6% vs 21.7%, P = .043). Patients with MCPyV DNA-positive tumors had better overall survival than those with MCPyV DNA-negative tumors (5-year survival: 45.0% vs 13.0%, respectively; P &lt; .001, two-sided log-rank test).
Among all eligible 5-year survivors (n = 2821), cumulative late mortality at 30 years was 25.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.4% to 28.3%), due primarily to recurrence and/or progression of primary disease. Patients who received cranial RT of 50 Gy or more (n = 813) had a cumulative incidence of a subsequent neoplasm within the CNS of 7.1% (95% CI = 4.5% to 9.6%) at 25 years from diagnosis compared with 1.0% (95% CI = 0% to 2.3%) for patients who had no RT. Survivors had higher risk than siblings of developing new endocrine, neurological, or sensory complications 5 or more years after diagnosis. Neurocognitive impairment was high and proportional to radiation dose for specific tumor types. There was a dose-dependent association between RT to the frontal and/or temporal lobes and lower rates of employment, and marriage.
Improvements in expected numbers of life-threatening events were only 0.07% and 0.81% for deciding whether to take tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer for women aged 50-59 and 40-49 years, respectively. For deciding whether to recommend screening mammograms to women aged 50-54 years, the reduction in expected losses was 0.86% if the ideal breast cancer prevalence threshold for recommending mammography was that of women aged 50-54 years. Cross-classification of risks indicated that some women classified by BCRAT would have different classifications with BCRATplus7, which might be useful if BCRATplus7 was well calibrated. Improvements from BCRATplus7 were small for risk-based allocation of mammograms under costs constraints.
The prevalence of NDRG4 promoter methylation in two independent series of colorectal cancers was 86% (71/83) and 70% (128/184) compared with 4% (2/48) in noncancerous colon mucosa (P &lt; .001). NDRG4 mRNA and protein expression were decreased in colorectal cancer tissue compared with noncancerous colon mucosa. NDRG4 overexpression in colorectal cancer cell lines suppressed colony formation (P = .014), cell proliferation (P &lt; .001), and invasion (P &lt; .001). NDRG4 promoter methylation analysis in fecal DNA from a training set of colorectal cancer patients and control subjects yielded a sensitivity of 61% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43% to 79%) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI = 90% to 97%). An independent test set of colorectal cancer patients and control subjects yielded a sensitivity of 53% (95% CI = 39% to 67%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI = 86% to 100%).
242 cases with the antemortem radiographic diagnosis of asbestosis (study group) were identified. 31 additional autopsies had been requested based on history of asbestos exposure without radiographic documentation of asbestosis (control group). Comparison of the two groups showed a statistically significant increase in the association of chest radiograph-diagnosed asbestosis and the presence at autopsy of pleural plaques (p = 0.0109), peribronchiolar or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (p = 0.0472), and histologically-diagnostic asbestosis (p = 0.0021). At autopsy, histologically-diagnostic asbestosis was confirmed in only 90 of the 243 study group cases. Comparison of individual parameters within the 242 study group cases showed a statistically significant correlation between the presence of fibrous pleural plaques and histologically-proven pulmonary fibrosis (p = 0.0025) as well as the subsequent histologic diagnosis of asbestosis (p &lt; 0.0001).
Foot pain was the most common presenting complaint, though limitation of activities, stiffness, preoperative hindfoot malalignment, and associated injuries were also frequently observed. One year after resection, 87% of the patients returned to sport or their past activities, whereas 5% had symptomatic regrowth requiring repeat resection. Seventy-four percent had improvement of subtalar motion and 82% had improvement of plantarflexion; which was identified as an additional clinical sign of a calcaneonavicular bar. Preoperative pain averaged 7 of 10, whereas postoperative pain averaged less than 1 of 10 at rest, while walking, and with activities. The cadaveric study showed that the EDB was able to fill on average only 64% of the resected gap, leaving approximately 10 mm of the plantar gap unfilled.
Differences between groups did not reach statistical significance; however, pain at mid-distraction was found to be slightly lower in the BtX-A group, as compared with the placebo group. Patients in the BtX-A group used less parenteral pain medication in the first 4 days after the surgery, had higher quality of life scores at 3 of the 5 time points assessed, and slightly higher functional mobility scores. All adverse events were expected complications of the lengthening process. No event was considered to be a serious adverse event related to the BtX-A injection itself. There was a trend toward fewer major adverse events in the BtX-A group.
The 3-year study data include 292 children, 88% male, with an average age of 11.9 years. Of the 439 orthopaedic injuries, there were 115 upper extremity, 173 lower extremity, and 96 vertebral, rib, or pelvic fractures, and 55 amputations (34 upper and 21 lower extremity). There were proportionally more closed fractures of the upper extremity in children under the age of 12 years compared with the older children with no difference in rates of other fractures or amputation by age group.
The cohort consisted of 224,628 patients with 2.29% in-hospital mortality. Sixteen of 19 potential variables were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The relative risk of dying was 61.7 times greater (95% confidence interval 57.5-66.1) when CHAID predicted mortality relative to when the model predicted survival (P&lt;0.0001). The most powerful variables of the CHAID model were low total GCS scores and systolic blood pressure in the ED. The CHAID model had an improved relative risk and a better combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value compared with GCS and systolic blood pressure in predicting mortality.
We calculated the minimum difference required for 2 measurements to be considered different with 95% confidence ("minimum agreement difference"). For head/shaft angle, the intraobserver minimum agreement difference was +/-7.27 degrees and the interobserver +/-8.80 degrees; for percent epiphyseal displacement, the intraobserver was +/-7.18% and the interobserver was +/-7.27%; and for width of epiphysis lateral to Klein's Line, the intraobserver was +/-1.98 mm and the interobserver +/-2.16 mm. For each of these measures, the slipped hips significantly differed from the control hips (P&lt;0.001 in all cases). Our analysis of the classical definition of Klein's Line--the lack of intersection between Klein's Line and the epiphysis as a sign of a slip--identified only 40.3% of slips. By modifying Klein's Line such that we measure the width of epiphysis lateral to Klein's Line, we improved sensitivity to 79% if a difference of 2 mm between hips indicated a slip.
The mean Iowa Hip Score was 84.73. Fifty-two patients were considered to have an excellent result, 28 a good result, 16 a fair result, and 9 a bad result. The pin placement was considered adequate in 89 patients and inadequate in 16 patients. Forty-three patients were girls and 62 were boys and no statistical difference was found in function by sex. The mean Iowa Hip Score for patients under 12 years of age (n=20) was 85.8, for those between 12 and 15 years of age (n=69) it was 82.8 and for those over 15 years of age (n=16) it was 82.5 (P=0.003). There were 10 complications, all in the group in which the pin placement was considered inadequate, and all of these were considered fair or poor results.
Two active preadolescents presented with groin pain after activity, a slightly antalgic gait, and difficulty squatting fully. On physical examination, both had less than 20 degrees of internal rotation with the hip in 90 degrees of flexion and a positive impingement sign, whereby groin pain was provoked by hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. One patient underwent osteochondroplasty and femoral valgus osteotomy, and the other osteochondroplasty alone, through surgical dislocation. Postoperatively, both had markedly improved free hip motion and no impingement sign.
The combined data resulted in 1649 distinct individuals with DDH. RR was significantly increased in first-degree relatives (RR=12.1; P&lt;0.000001), siblings (RR=11.9; P&lt;0.000001) and first cousins (RR=1.7; P=0.04). A total of 468 families were identified with at least 5 affected individuals in a family. These results were then filtered to only contain families that had a P value of less than 0.01. This resulted in 141 founders with anywhere between 4 and 30 affected living descendants with a P value of less than 0.01 with family sizes ranging from 594 to 44,819 descendants. A total of 28 founders had a familial standardize incidence ratio of greater than 5.0.
Of 126 families who were mailed the pretrial results survey, 68% (86/126) of patients and 59% (74/126) of parents responded. Ninety-eight percent (84/86) of respondent patients and 96% (71/74) of respondent parents wanted to receive the results of the trial. Eighty-seven percent (75/86) of respondent patients and 86% (63/74) of respondent parents said the trial was a positive experience. Thirty-seven percent (32/86) of patients and 31% (23/74) of parents responded to the posttrial results survey, 25% (32/126) and 18% (23/126) of total trial participants, respectively. Sixty-three percent (20/32) of respondent patients and 70% (16/23) of respondent parents also felt that receiving the trial results by letter, with a telephone number for any questions, was the best way to receive the information. Seventy-two percent (23/32) of respondent patients and 70% (16/23) of respondent parents said they would participate in a future clinical trial.
There were no statistical differences in SF-36 scores. There was a trend toward more pain in the group fused to the sacrum (P=0.1). There were no statistically significant differences in difficulty with activities, but there was a trend toward increased difficulty with hygiene after toileting in the group with fusion to the sacrum (odds ratio: 3.76, confidence interval: 0.53-26.87, P=0.19).
There was no difference between the 2 groups in the rate of correction (approximately 10 degrees/y, P=0.48). Complication rates were similar (12.8% vs. 12.5%, P=1.0). Patients with abnormal physes (eg, Blount disease, skeletal dysplasias) had a higher complication rate (27.8% vs. 6.7% for patients with normal physes, P=0.04) with no difference between the 8-plate and staple groups (P=1.0). The patients in the 8-plate group were significantly younger than those in the staple group (P=0.04).
Time-to-quadriceps muscle recovery was as follows: 15% by the end of 3 months, 11% by 4 months, 13% by 5 months, and 20% by 6 months. Overall, 32 patients (59%) achieved &gt;or=85% quadriceps strength within 6 months of their surgery date. Of those patients, 16 (50%) patients returned to full activity within 6 months of the date of surgery. Sex was not found to be a significant difference in regard to strength outcomes.
The average biceps angle was 47.9+/-15.2 degrees on the uninvolved side and 26.2+/-15.0 degrees on the involved side. The average differences between the 2 shoulders in the biceps angle (21.7+/-20.5 degrees), the version (18.9+/-15.0 degrees), and the PHHA (19.8+/-13.6%) were all significant (P&lt;0.001). Only the biceps angle correlated significantly with external rotation (P&lt;0.001). This correlation remained significant even when the version and the PHHA were held constant (P=0.004).
Similar to the published normative pediatric data, 75 (88%) of BPBP children played sports, with 61 (72%) involved in individual and 54 (63%) in team sports. The children participated in a broad variety of sports, including those requiring upper extremity dexterity such as baseball, basketball, swimming, and gymnastics. Although most participated at a local/recreational level, some children did compete at the professional/national level. Types of sports injuries were also similar to published pediatric norms, with bruises and sprains being most common. Although the study cohort had lower Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument functional scores than the general population, these scores did not statistically differ between those children who played sports and those who did not.
Dynamic thumb alignment was significantly worse than static thumb alignment (P=0.0005). Comparable improvements were achieved in both static and dynamic thumb alignment after surgical thumb reconstruction (P=0.6242). Optimal outcome was achieved more frequently in the static alignment (82% of cases) than in the dynamic alignment (61% of cases). There was poor correlation between the spontaneous use of the involved extremity before surgery and the changes in thumb dynamic alignment after surgery (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.1554, P=0.39).
Five cysts were grade 1 (healed 100%), 6 grade 2 (healed &gt;50%), 2 grade 3 (healed &lt;50% with increased cortical thickness), and none grade 4 (recurrence/enlargement). The average resolution of cystic area in 11/13 cysts was 85.7% at final follow-up of 35.8 months (P=0.0001) with 2.8 mm of average gain in cortical thickness (P=0.0018). None of the 13 lesions required an additional procedure or repeat injection. All patients were clinically asymptomatic at latest follow-up.
Our database included 70 consecutive, eligible children aged 2 weeks to 14 years. Staphylococci were the only organisms isolated in cases of osteomyelitis, whereas Streptococcal infection was more prevalent in patients with septic arthritis. Using our treatment protocol, we found that 59% of children could be converted to oral therapy after 3 days of intravenous therapy and 86% after 5 days. The median duration of inpatient stay was 5 days. We established that 3 weeks of oral therapy was appropriate for those patients who received 5 days or less intravenous treatment. We have identified temperature and C-reactive protein as the best quantitative means of monitoring response to therapy. All patients were clinically, hematologically, and radiologically normal before discharge 1 year post-presentation.
We found a significant increase in 3-nitrotyrosine levels among patients in the early (p &lt; 0.010) and late (p &lt; 0.010) stages of bipolar disorder. The activity of GR and GST was increased only among patients in the late stage of illness. Glutathione peroxidase activity and carbonyl content did not differ among the groups.
Analysis of a previously published data set revealed that VNS increased not only the spontaneous firing rates of NE neurons, but also the percentage of neurons firing in bursts. The enhancement of the 5-HT neuron firing rate by VNS was abolished by lesioning NE neurons. We found that VNS increased the degree of activation of postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on 5-HT neurons, probably through an increased release of endogenous NE. The tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the hippocampus was enhanced after 14 days of VNS, as with other antidepressant treatments.
Glial densities, neuronal densities and soma sizes measured in BA24a did not differ significantly between controls and suicide completers. Secondary analyses showed a significant and robust increase in glial cell densities in BA24a of alcohol-dependent depressed suicide completers compared with depressed suicide completers who were not alcohol-dependent (38%) and, to a lesser extent, controls (30%).
Hippocampus volumes of patients with BPD and PTSD were smaller than those of healthy controls. However, there was no significant difference between patients with BPD but without PTSD and controls. Impulsiveness was positively correlated with hippocampus volumes in patients with BPD.
Participants with gSAD exhibited enhanced bilateral amygdala and insula reactivity to negative (v. neutral) images compared with healthy controls who did not exhibit enhanced reactivity. Within the gSAD group, the extent of amygdala activation was correlated with social anxiety severity, whereas the extent of insula activation was correlated with trait anxiety.
Within 200 ms poststimulus, patients with first-episode schizophrenia showed alterations in gamma synchrony during both conscious and nonconscious emotion perception. Stimulus-locked synchrony was reduced in patients, particularly over the temporal cortex, whereas complementary enhancements in absolute gamma synchrony (independent of stimuli) were more distributed over temporal and left parieto-occipital regions. This pattern of altered synchrony predicted poor performance on each measure of social cognition among these patients. Medication dosage did not correlate significantly with either gamma synchrony or behavioural measures in this group.
In patients (17 girls, mean age 12 years; 13 social phobia, 9 generalized anxiety, 3 other), the combined response probability (p = 0.027) of all muscles, the combined area under the curve of all muscles (p = 0.011) and the sympathetic skin response (p = 0.006) were enlarged compared with matched controls. The response probability (p = 0.48) and area under the curve (p = 0.07) of the blink response were normal in patients compared with controls. The ASR pattern was normal with normal latencies in patients compared with controls. In nonaffected siblings, the sympathetic skin response (p = 0.038), but not the combined response probability of all muscles (p = 0.15), was enlarged compared with controls.
Patients in the acAN group were aged 14-29 years and had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 14.9 (standard deviation [SD] 1.4) kg/m(2). Those in the recAN group were aged 15-29 years and had a mean BMI of 20.5 (SD 1.3) kg/m(2) and the controls were aged 15-26 years and had a BMI of 21.4 (SD 2.1) kg/m(2). The mean serum BDNF levels were significantly increased in the recAN group compared with the acAN group (8820, SD 3074 v. 6161, SD 2885 pg/mL, U = 154.5, p = 0.001). There were no significant associations between BDNF and either platelet 5-HT content or platelet 5-HT uptake. Among patients with anorexia nervosa, we found significant positive linear relations between BDNF and BMI (r = 0.312, p = 0.023) and between BDNF and leptin (r = 0.365, p = 0.016).
One thousand twenty HCV patients with SAD were included in the registry. Patients were reported from Southern Europe (60%), North America (15%), Asia (14%), Northern Europe (9%), South America (1%), and Australia (1%). Countries reporting the most cases were Spain (236 cases), France (222 cases), Italy (144 cases), USA (120 cases), and Japan (95 cases). The most frequently reported SAD were Sjögren's syndrome (SS; 483 cases), rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 150 cases), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 129 cases), polyarteritis nodosa (78 cases), antiphospholipid syndrome (59 cases), inflammatory myopathies (39 cases), and sarcoidosis (28 cases). Twenty patients had 2 or more SAD. Epidemiological data were available in 677 cases. Four hundred eighty-seven (72%) patients were female and 186 (28%) male, with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 1.0 years at SAD diagnosis and 50.5 +/- 1.1 years at diagnosis of HCV infection. The main immunologic features were antinuclear antibody (ANA) in 61% of patients, rheumatoid factor (RF) in 57%, hypocomplementemia in 52%, and cryoglobulins in 52%. The main differential aspect between primary and HCV-related SAD was the predominance of cryoglobulinemic-related markers (cryoglobulins, RF, hypocomplementemia) over specific SAD-related markers (anti-ENA antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) in patients with HCV.
Across the spectrum of clinical outcomes, including ACR20 nonresponses and remission-like responses, therapy with adalimumab plus MTX permitted less radiographic progression at Weeks 26 and 104 than MTX monotherapy. Adalimumab monotherapy was generally intermediate. A strong, proportional relationship was observed between clinical response and radiographic efficacy only for MTX monotherapy. The monotherapies approximated the radiographic efficacy of adalimumab plus MTX only among remission-like responders, although progression was significantly greater with MTX monotherapy versus adalimumab plus MTX for patients with TJC = 0. Concurrent clinical (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) and radiographic (DeltaTSS &lt;or= 0.5) remission was significantly more frequent at Week 104 with adalimumab plus MTX (45%) than with adalimumab (25%) or MTX (18%) monotherapy.
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) concentrations were higher in pre- and postmenopausal women with RA than in controls (p = 0.023 and p &lt;or= 0.001, respectively). All RA patients had significantly lower levels of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio, and postmenopausal women with RA also had significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels than their respective controls. No differences were observed in serum levels of apolipoprotein A-I and triglyceride. All RA patients had higher lipoprotein(a) values than controls. Fourteen men (56%) and 10 (53%) and 42 (54%) pre- and postmenopausal women with RA, respectively, had hyperlipoproteinemia(a).
Significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlations were observed between histological vessel density and percentage of the synovial area with a k value &gt; 0.01 (r = 0.93) and k(max) values (r = 0.79), as well as between the 2 latter parameters (r = 0.72). The histological vessel density and the 2 acoustic parameters were also significantly correlated with the logarithm of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.77, r = 0.87, r = 0.67, respectively) and with log C-reactive protein serum concentration (r = 0.69, r = 0.83, r = 0.62, respectively).
Median ESR at presentation was 30 mm/h at both sites. Mean ESR was 36 mm/h in Jyväskylä and 35 mm/h in Nashville. ESR was &lt; 28 mm/h in 45% and 47% of patients at the 2 sites, respectively. CRP was normal in 44% and 58%, and all RF tests were negative in 38% and 37%, respectively. Both ESR and CRP were normal in 33% and 42% of patients, and all 3 tests were normal in 15% and 14% of patients in whom they were assessed. All 3 tests were abnormal in only 28% in Jyväskylä and 23% in Nashville.
Degenerative tears were significantly more prevalent in the medial meniscus among floor layers than among graphic designers [OR 2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-4.98] and significantly more floor layers had medial tears in both knees (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.41-8.48). Tears extending to the tibial aspect and localized in the middle and posterior one-third of the medial meniscus were most prevalent. Lateral meniscal tears were predominantly unilateral and the prevalence of lateral tears did not differ between the 2 study groups. Knee complaints occurred in about 50% of all floor layers, irrespective of the presence of meniscal tears.
There were 209 patients, 88% female and 92% Caucasian, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 43.7 (13.8) years. Followup was available in 175/209 (84%) patients. There were 299 NP events in 132/209 (63%) patients over a mean followup of 3.6 (2.5) years. Thirty-one percent of NP events in 54 patients were attributed to SLE. Multivariate analysis indicated lower MCS scores in patients with NP events compared to those without events (p &lt; 0.001) regardless of attribution. The group means for PCS scores were significantly lower in patients with NP events (p &lt; 0.001) regardless of attribution. There was no association between HRQOL and cumulative organ damage, nor between NP events and the progression of organ damage.
Sixteen rheumatologists accompanied by 10 arthritis nurses used the material to prescribe COBRA therapy to a total of 27 patients. Rheumatologists and nurses both gave high marks to the supplied materials. Eighty-eight percent of rheumatologists reported that the material sped up the prescription process, and 65% indicated they would prescribe COBRA therapy more frequently if these materials were available routinely. Patients expressed great satisfaction with the information handouts, rating it 2.8 (standard deviation 0.5) on a scale of -3 (very negative) to +3 (very positive). Most patients (89%) planned to keep the information booklet as a reference and 70% used it as a tool to remember the correct intake of medication. The attitude and perceived capability of nurses towards the guidance of patients with RA receiving COBRA therapy was improved through a brief educational intervention.
Twenty-six patients (30%) had an abnormal 6MWT and the mean 6MWD was 461.8 +/- 103.0 m. When considering 6MWT as a binary variable - normal or abnormal - C-reactive protein (CRP) was the only independent variable associated with abnormal 6MWT. Considered as a continuous variable, the 6MWD was associated with measures of lung involvement and inflammation, with the activity and severity of disease, and also with quality of life; nevertheless, calcinosis was the only independent factor associated in multivariate analyses with a trend for an association for CRP.
Forty-six cases (38 female; 40 diffuse cutaneous SSc) were identified. Mean age at SSc and SRC onset was 52.8 years +/- 13.2 and 55.4 years +/- 11.8, respectively. ANA were present in 44 patients (96%). Anti-topo I antibodies were detected in 30 (65%), anti-RNAP I-III in 7 (15%). No differences emerged between these 2 groups for their main clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients in the anti-RNAP I-III group developing SRC early (&lt; 18 mo) in the course of SSc was significantly higher (p = 0.03). Cumulative survival rates were 64%, 53%, and 35% at 1, 2, and 10 years of followup, respectively. Survival rates of SSc patients significantly differed according to their autoantibody profile, being lower in the anti-topo I than in the anti-RNAP I-III group (p = 0.034).
Among 53 patients screened, 17 (32%) had &gt;or= 1 test positive, with 5 (9.4%) patients having TB infection (clinical, CT, biopsy). The remaining 12 patients showed latent TB; 1 additional patient with negative screening tests was diagnosed with latent TB retrospectively for he developed TB disease within a few weeks of receiving infliximab. The remaining 35 patients tested negative with all tests. The combination of 4 screening tests gave a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.74, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.29, and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.97. Only 22 patients could afford treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors; 19 of them were negative in the screening tests. Three patients who were positive on TST and/or QTG received prophylactic treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitor. Since implementation of the screening strategy, only 1 of 22 (4.5%) patients given TNF-alpha inhibitor developed probable TB disease.
The cohort included 761 eligible patients [516 (67.8%) female, 245 (32.2%) male] with JIA. Mean disease onset age (+/- standard deviation) was 6.25 +/- 4.4 years (range 0.5-15.9). Disease mean duration to last visit was 10.02 +/- 4.31 years. Followup mean period was 7.6 +/- 6.4 years (range 1.5-35 yrs). A total of 247 (32.46%) patients achieved remission according to criteria [persistent oligoarthritis 153 (42.9%); extended oligoarthritis 15 (13.1%); seronegative polyarthritis 21 (22.4%); systemic arthritis 33 (33.7%); enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) plus juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) 25 (33.4%)]. No patients with seropositive polyarthritis achieved remission status (p &lt; 0.001). In remitted patients the mean survival function (+/- standard error of the mean) before relapse calculated by Kaplan-Meier was of 20.9 (+/- 1.3) months overall: 21.7 (+/- 0.46) in persistent oligoarthritis, 25.0 (+/- 6.6) in extended oligoarthritis, 26.7 (+/- 13.2) in seronegative polyarthritis, and 17.6 (+/- 2.44) in ERA+JPsA (p &gt; 0.1).
At baseline, mean (standard deviation, SD) score [parent report] of the PedsQL-GC and the PedsQL-RM was 75 (17) and 79 (14), respectively; the mean (SD) of the CHQ physical summary score (CHQ-PHS) was 49 (7) and that of the CHQ psychological summary score was 42 (12). Higher BILAG scores, especially in the general, musculoskeletal, neurological, and vascular, but not the mucocutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, or hematological BILAG domains, were associated with a significantly lower HRQOL. Patients with damage had lower HRQOL than those without damage. All HRQOL measures included were at most modestly responsive to clinically important changes with cSLE.
Data were available on 297 patients (206 with RA, 57 PsA, 34 AS). The mean age was 55 years, with 12 years of disease, and the mean baseline HAQ (standard error, SE) was 1.37 (0.04). The changes in HAQ (SE) at Years 1, 2, and 3 were -0.31 (0.04), -0.24 (0.06), and -0.27 (0.07) for annual cost to achieve MCID of $41,636, $42,077, and $42,147, respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 1.94 (RA), 1.88 (PsA), and 2.30 (AS). There were no statistical differences between the diseases studied.
There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data or clinically significant differences in AHI scores between sexes. Linear regression modeling showed that female sex was a significant predictor of a greater AHI score prior to surgery (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a greater AHI score was an independent predictor of a lower WOMAC change score at 1 year (p = 0.01).
Golimumab + MTX treatment significantly decreased serum CRP, SAA, IL-18, E-selectin, TIMP-1, and MMP-9 levels (median percent changes of -4.1% to -74.3% across treatment groups) versus MTX alone (-5.8% to 9.7%) when first measured at Week 4; decreases were sustained through Week 16. Larger magnitudes of decrease in all biomarkers were observed for clinical responders versus nonresponders. For golimumab + MTX, regression analyses including all biomarkers and select clinical measures showed that reductions in levels of several markers (SAA, E-selectin, MMP-9) as early as Week 4 correlated significantly with improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) at Week 16, as did reductions in E-selectin with improvement in tender joint count at Week 16. After accounting for the biomarkers, however, treatment group was no longer significant for SJC.
In both sexes, allelic variation in the gene encoding GHRH was associated with BMC and BMD at the proximal femur and lumbar spine, with results generally stronger in women. In women, the mean BMC lumbar spine within the GHRH 11 genotype was 56.9 g, while that of the GHRH 12 genotype was 68.4 g [p &lt; 0.001, fully adjusted for age, body mass index, cigarette and alcohol consumption, dietary calcium intake, physical activity, years since menopause, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use]; corresponding figures for BMD lumbar spine (GHRH 11 genotype) were 0.96 g/cm(2) versus 1.10 g/cm(2) (p &lt; 0.001 fully adjusted).
Of 599 SSc patients, 317 had prior or current digital ulcers. These patients were more frequently male, with impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and higher Rodnan skin scores than patients never affected by digital ulcers. In a multivariate analysis, male gender, early onset of SSc, increased duration of SSc, high Rodnan skin score, and presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibodies (anti-topo I) were associated with prior or current digital ulcers. Comparison of patients with current digital ulcers versus patients never affected indicated that affected patients had increased duration of SSc, impaired DLCO, increased Rodnan score, and younger age at onset of SSc.
Self-reported comorbidity data were verified by chart review for 130 patients with SSc. The sensitivity of the self-reports for the 5 comorbid conditions was low [range 35% (cancer) to 86% (diabetes)]. The specificity was moderate to high [range 76% (osteoarthritis/back pain) to 99% (cancer)]. The positive predictive values ranged from 31% (depression) to 86% (cancer).
We included 634 patients during the first 3 years, with mean (25th-75th percentile) arthritis duration of 30 (11-63) days. Monoarthritis was present in 243 (38.3%) patients, 216 (34.1%) had oligoarthritis, and 175 (27.6%) polyarthritis. Patients with polyarthritis were older, had longer duration of arthritis, and were more frequently anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor-positive. Patients in all 3 joint pattern groups (mono-/oligo-/polyarthritis) reported substantial effect on physical function, pain, and fatigue and had elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. Knee or ankle arthritis was most frequent in patients with mono- and oligoarthritis, whereas small joint involvement was most frequent in patients with polyarthritis.
Primary SS was diagnosed in 107 (79.2%) patients and the remaining 28 subjects (20.8%) constituted the control group. US changes of salivary glands were established in 98/107 patients with SS and in 14/28 controls. Mean US score was 26 in SS patients and 6 in controls. Through ROC curves, US arose as the best performer (0.95 +/- 0.01), followed by scintigraphy (0.86 +/- 0.31). Setting the cutoff score for US at 19 resulted in the best ratio of specificity (90.8%) to sensitivity (87.1%), while setting the cutoff scintigraphic score at 6 resulted in specificity of 86.1% and sensitivity of 67.1%. Among 70 patients with US score &gt;or= 19, a scintigraphic score &gt; 6 was recorded in 54/70 (77.1%) and positive biopsy findings in 62/70 (88.5%) patients.
Cerebral vasculopathy was identified on CT scan in 22 patients (moderate in 12 and severe in 10) and on MRI in 38 patients (moderate in 28 and severe in 10). Patients with severe cerebral vasculopathy seen on MRI were more likely to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; p = 0.003) and showed a tendency to have scleroderma renal crisis (SRC; p = 0.25, test for trend p = 0.097). A similar association was found between severe cerebral vasculopathy seen on CT scan and PAH (p = 0.026) or SRC (p = 0.04). After adjusting for age and hypertension, severe cerebral vasculopathy was still associated with increased risk of severe vascular manifestations [odds ratio (OR) 32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.45-297, p = 0.002 for CT scan; OR 26, 95% CI 1.71-394, p = 0.019 for MRI].
Seroprevalence was 0.86% for HCV (n = 7) and 0.12% for HBV (n = 1). HCV-related arthritis was diagnosed in 4 (0.5%) patients; no patient had HBV-related arthritis. HCV-seropositive patients had significantly higher transaminase levels (ALAT, 41.5 IU vs 23.2 IU, p = 0.02; and ASAT, 39.2 IU vs 21.8 IU, p = 0.001) but only 2 patients had ASAT or ALAT levels &gt; 40 IU. No significant differences were found for anti-CCP antibodies, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or other test. HCV seroprevalence was significantly higher in the subgroup with history of blood transfusion than in other patients (3.7% vs 0.42%, p = 0.02). Two of the 7 HCV positive patients and the single patient with confirmed hepatitis B infection were born in areas with higher prevalence of viral hepatitis (Togo, Senegal, Vietnam). Positive hepatitis status was known before study inclusion in 4 of the 7 HCV-positive patients and in the HBV-positive patient.
After a median 60 months' followup, the overall disease extent score from HCRT scans decreased from 10 (0-45) to 4 (0-36) (p = 0.04) 6 months after AHSCT, and thereafter increased up to 36 months and stabilized; the modified Rodnan skin score fell (p &lt; 0.05).
The TLR4 +896 G allele was significantly increased in biopsy-proven GCA patients compared to controls [p = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.52]. The increase was due to a significantly increased frequency of heterozygosity for the TLR4 -896 A/G genotype in the group of patients with biopsy-proven GCA compared to controls (TLR4 -896 A/G heterozygous in patients with GCA 18.1% compared to 11.4% in controls: p = 0.01; OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.10-2.69). However, no significant differences were observed when patients with GCA were stratified according to the presence of specific clinical features of the disease.
Over the study period there was reduction in tobacco farmers' perceptions of threat from tobacco control initiatives.
Overall, 26.7% of rural women and 15.5% of rural men reported some form of lifetime IPV victimization, similar to the prevalence found among men and women in non-rural areas. Within several states, those living in rural areas evidenced significantly higher lifetime IPV prevalence than those in non-rural areas.
Rural areas with no RHC had significantly lower rates of HbA1c testing, lipid profiles, and eye exams than urban areas (P &lt; .01). Rural areas with at least 1 RHC had significantly higher rates for lipid profiles and eye exams than other rural areas (P &lt; .05). No significant differences were detected in testing rates between rural areas with an RHC present and urban areas.
The proportion of claimants using chiropractors was higher in rural than urban residents (44% vs 32%, P &lt; .001). Lack of conventional providers in rural areas did not completely explain this difference, nor did differences in patient cost-sharing or demographics. Among those who used chiropractors, those in urban areas had more chiropractic visits than users of chiropractic in rural areas.
Enrollment and inpatient utilization counts for rural veterans vary considerably from one classification system to another, though the systems generally agree that admission rates, length of stay, and reliance on the VA for care are lower for rural veterans. Among older dual VA and Medicare enrollees, rural residents rely on non-VA facilities more, though this effect also varies widely depending on the classification scheme. VISNs vary greatly in the proportions of patients who are rural residents, and in the degree to which classification systems are discordant in designating patients as rural.
CNAs in micropolitan and other rural nursing homes were more likely to be white and US citizens than were urban CNAs. Rural or micropolitan CNAs were more likely to note "job close to home" as a reason for becoming a CNA than were urban CNAs (70.8%, 66.3%, and 43.6%, respectively; P &lt; .001). Over half of CNAs (52.2%) entered the field from a different job category. CNAs in micropolitan and small rural counties were more likely than urban CNAs to report being trained at a nursing facility (61.4%, 65.4%, 52.5%; P &lt; .001) rather than community college or other site. Informal means (family and friends) were the most common recruitment path.
Specific themes found that related to the rural environment included (1) conservatism, (2) isolation, (3) lack of privacy, (4) stigma, (5) the paradox of the rural environment, and (6) the uniqueness of rural life.
The response rate to the survey was 44%. Overall, 31% of the respondent pharmacies offered MTMS and 31% offered DSM programs. Higher service orientation, location in a more rural area, and lower workload per pharmacist were significantly positively related to provision of any DTS.
Mean comfort level of all respondents with the 7 selected emergency interventions ranged from 2.3 for assisting with thoracentesis to 3.6 for assisting with precipitous vaginal delivery, indicating only a moderate comfort level with the selected emergency interventions. While 70% of the 86 respondents answered "yes" when asked if they felt comfortable in emergency situations, the percentage of respondents who reported being comfortable ranged from 33% to 83%.
The survey response rate was 81% for providers (n = 46) and 90% for nursing staff (n = 63). Only 54% of health care professionals knew CRC is a leading cause of cancer deaths. When surveyed on their attitudes toward colon cancer, 92%"strongly agreed" or "agreed" that colon cancer is preventable. About 99% (n = 107) of providers and nurses "strongly agreed" or "agreed" that testing could identify problems before colon cancer starts. Most health care professionals (61%) aged &gt; or =50 years had previously been tested and were up-to-date (52%) with screening. Provider knowledge was significantly associated with higher patient screening (P = .02), but provider attitudes and beliefs were not. Moreover, personal screening practices of health care professionals did not correlate with more patients screened.
Patients treated in the MIPA model of care had lower odds of readmission within 30 days (odds ratio 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-0.87, P &lt; .03).
For-profit RRCs treated less complex cases and reported fewer discharges per bed and fewer occupied beds than did non-profits. However, for-profit RRCs staffed their beds with fewer full-time-equivalent (FTE) personnel and served a higher proportion of Medicaid patients. For-profit RRCs generated operating cash flow margins in excess of 19%, compared to only 8.1% for non-profits, and maintained newer plant and equipment.
About 100% of the target sample was identified. Of the eligible 67 individuals &gt; or =97 years old, 31 were evaluated in-person. The prevalence of dementia (probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia) was 61.3% (95% CI: 43.8, 76.2), mild cognitive impairment was 29.0% (95% CI: 16.1, 46.6), and no dementia was 9.7% (95% CI: 3.4, 25.0). Parkinsonism and the APOEe4 allele were rare. Systemic vascular disease was almost universally present.
Twenty-six families in the parent-only intervention and 24 families in the family intervention completed all 3 assessments. As reported previously, both intervention programs led to significantly greater decreases in weight status relative to the control condition at month 10 follow-up. There was no significant difference in weight status change between the parent-only and family interventions. Total program costs for the parent-only and family interventions were 13,546 US dollars and 20,928, US dollars respectively. Total cost per child for the parent-only and family interventions were 521 US dollars and 872 US dollars, respectively.
Follow up was 95 months (range: 2-130 months). We assayed PAR1 in a cohort of patients composed of 136 patients; we found PAR1 expression assayed by immunoblotting was selectively associated with high grade patients (50 cases of the study cohort; P = 0.001). Twenty-nine of 50 (58%) patients overexpressed PAR1, and 23 of these (46%) developed metastases. HER1, stage, ER and PAR1 overexpression were robustly correlated (Cox regression, P = 0.002, P = 0.024 and P = 0.002 respectively). Twenty-one of the 50 patients (42%) expressed both receptors (PAR1 and HER1 P = 0.0004). We also found a statistically significant correlation between PAR1 overexpression and increased mortality (P = 0.0001) and development of metastases (P = 0.0009).
Human VLC are present in ovarian and non-ovarian tumors. The majority of VLC appear to be Tie2+ monocytes. VLC and Tie2+ monocytes express high levels of CD52, the target of the immunotherapeutic Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab potently induces complement-mediated lysis of VLC in vitro and ex-vivo in ovarian tumor ascites. Anti-CD52 immunotherapy targeting VLC restricts tumor angiogenesis and growth in murine ovarian cancer.
PZIR administration resulted in a significant decrease in 9-hour mean blood glucose (199+/-114 versus 417+/-83 mg/dL, X+/-SD, P&lt;.001) and serum fructosamine (375+/-117 versus 505+/-96 micromol/L, P&lt;.001) concentration and a significant increase in mean body weight (5.9+/-1.4 versus 5.4+/-1.5 kg, P=.017) in 133 diabetic cats at day 45 compared with day 0, respectively. By day 45, polyuria and polydipsia had improved in 79% (105 of 133), 89% (118 of 133) had a good body condition, and 9-hour mean blood glucose concentration, serum fructosamine concentration, or both had improved in 84% (112 of 133) of the cats compared with day 0. Hypoglycemia (&lt;80 mg/dL) was identified in 151 of 678, 9-hour serial blood glucose determinations and in 85 of 133 diabetic cats. Hypoglycemia causing clinical signs was confirmed in 2 diabetic cats.
One hundred and eighteen cats were recruited with a median age of 13 years. Ninety-five cats (80.5%) had been followed or reached the study end point by 12 months of which 30.5% (29/95) developed azotemia. Age, systolic blood pressure, plasma creatinine concentration, urine specific gravity, UP/C, UA/C, and NAG index were significantly associated with development of azotemia in the univariable analysis (P&lt;or=.05). However, in the multivariable analysis, only plasma creatinine concentration with either UP/C (Model 1) or UA/C (Model 2) remained significant.
A total of 144 synovial fluid samples were examined. Repeated arthrocentesis was not associated with increases in synovial fluid neutrophil numbers. Mild mononuclear inflammation was detected in 13 samples from 6 dogs.
Rottweilers and purebred, large breed dogs predominated. Dogs were middle-aged and typically had chronic signs of upper or lower gastrointestinal disease. Decreased appetite, vomiting, and evidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage were present in the majority of cases. An abdominal or rectal mass was frequently noted on physical examination. Common laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, mature neutrophilia, hypoproteinemia, and hypocholesterolemia. The masses were histologically composed of moderate to severe eosinophilic infiltrates, which were often transmural and accompanied by fibrosis. All dogs treated with surgery alone died of complications of their disease. Treatment with corticosteroids and ivermectin improved clinical signs, caused resolution of eosinophilic infiltrates, and prolonged survival in most dogs treated medically.
A causative mutation for HCM was not identified, although several single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected.
Using the higher dose led to a normal test interpretation in 9 of the 15 dogs, in which stimulation had been abnormal using the lower dose. Based on follow-up information, hypothyroidism was excluded in 7 of these 9 dogs. In all 6 dogs with a blunted response to the higher dose, hypothyroidism could be confirmed. Healthy dogs showed significantly higher post-TSH T4 concentrations with the higher compared with the lower dose. Post-TSH T4 concentrations after TSH stimulation were not related to dogs' body weight in either healthy or diseased dogs.
Clinical resolution of SRMA was achieved in all 20 dogs. Serum CRP concentration remained increased at remission in 16/20 dogs whereas CSF cytology was within normal limits in 20/20 dogs. Serum APPs decreased significantly on treatment (P&lt;.05) except Hp, which remained unaltered. Serum and CSF IgA concentrations remained increased for the duration of treatment.
All dogs had cortical blindness and other neurologic abnormalities including gait and behavioral changes. Magnetic resonance imaging of 3 dogs showed multiple disorganized gyri, which were especially apparent on T2-weighted dorsal plane images. Electroencephalogram (EEG) of 1 dog revealed epileptiform discharges, including both spike and spike and wave discharges with voltage maximum potentials over the parietal/occipital region. The EEG supported that the repetitive behavior displayed by the dog was a complex partial motor seizure. One dog had concurrent hydrocephalus. All dogs had occipital lobe involvement and 2 dogs had involvement of other lobes.
Peritoneal D-dimer concentration was significantly higher in all colic groups compared with controls, and in horses with enteritis, peritonitis, and ischemic disorders compared with horses with large intestinal obstructions. Peritoneal D-dimer concentration was significantly higher in horses with altered peritoneal fluid (modified transudate and exudate) compared with horses with normal peritoneal fluid analysis. Plasma D-dimer concentration also was significantly higher in the peritonitis group, and in horses with altered peritoneal fluid analysis. Peritoneal and plasma D-dimer concentrations also were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Peritoneal d-dimer concentration was significantly correlated with decreased peritoneal t-PA activity and increased peritoneal PAI-1 activity.
Alpacas had significantly (P=&lt;.001-.015) lower plasma glucose and higher insulin concentrations for the hyperglycemic period after receiving exenatide than after saline injections. Colic signs were observed in 5 of 6 alpacas treated with exenatide.
The percentage of Tregs was significantly increased overall in dogs with cancer compared with control dogs. When tumor types were compared, Treg percentages were significantly increased in dogs with carcinoma. The Treg/CD8 T cell ratio was significantly higher in dogs with cancer compared with control dogs and was also significantly increased in 2 dogs with T-cell lymphoma.
The mRNA expression levels of PLN and HAX-1, but not SERCA2alpha were significantly (P=.08), reduced in dogs with moderate to severe CMVI. The fold change in PLN expression compared with control were 0.38+/-0.07 (in group II) and 0.20+/-0.10 (in group III), while HAX-1 expression were 0.37+/-0.06 (group II) and 0.41+/-0.12 (group III). The expressions of PLN and HAX-1 were significantly reduced in groups II and III (P&lt;.05) but not in group I (P&gt;.05). The reduced PLN and HAX-1 expressions were highly correlated with the severity of heart failure (P&lt;.001), vertebral heart score (P&lt;.05), and left atrium to aortic root ratio (P&lt;.05).
At T0, the average age of dogs in the study group was 6.3+/-1.4 years. Their average body weight decreased from 35+/-18 kg at T0 to 27+/-14 kg at T6 (P&lt;.05). All dogs remained normotensive throughout the study. GFR increased significantly with levothyroxine supplementation; the corresponding results were 1.6+/-0.4 mL/min/kg at T0, 2.1+/-0.4 at T1, and 2.0+/-0.4 at T6 (P&lt;.01).
Although serum cTnI concentrations were significantly higher in cattle with pericarditis compared with healthy cattle, they were not significantly different from concentrations in cattle with endocarditis, congenital cardiac disease, mediastinal abscess, reticulitis, caudal vena cava thrombosis, or chronic suppurative pneumonia.
In the ADHAC group, plasma ACTH measurements ranged between 6 and 1250 pg/mL (median, 30 pg/mL). In the AIHAC group, all ACTH concentrations were below the lower quantification limit of the assay (&lt;5 pg/mL). The 95% confidence interval was 85-100% for sensitivity and 97-100% for specificity in AIHAC diagnosis.
One-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. Plasma NH3 was significantly lower after the test diet than after the control diet. The test diet also resulted in significantly higher fibrinogen concentrations and lower prothrombin times. The HE score improved with both diets, with no significant difference between the 2 diets.
Renal carcinoma affects horses of all ages with most cases observed in geldings and Thoroughbreds. The most common presenting complaints are nonspecific and usually do not occur until late in the course of the disease. Routine laboratory results generally are unremarkable with no evidence of renal dysfunction. Urine and peritoneal fluid analyses are consistently abnormal, but the changes usually are nonspecific. Rectal palpation often allows detection of an abnormal kidney or a mass in the area of the kidney. Renal ultrasound examination is the most rewarding imaging procedure, and when combined with renal biopsy, antemortem diagnosis can be achieved. Renal carcinoma is both locally invasive and metastatic, necessitating careful staging for metastasis using thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasound examination. If the tumor is localized to 1 kidney, nephrectomy is the treatment of choice. No chemotherapy or radiation treatment for renal carcinoma has been reported in the horse. Median survival for this series of cases was 11 days (0 days-1 year).
Transit time in the cervical esophagus (cm/s) was significantly delayed when dogs were in lateral recumbency for both liquid (2.58+/-1.98 versus 7.23+/-3.11; P=.001) and kibble (4.44+/-2.02 versus 8.92+/-4.80; P=.002). In lateral recumbency, 52+/-22% of liquid and 73+/-23% of kibble swallows stimulated primary esophageal peristalsis. In sternal recumbency, 77+/-24% of liquid (P=.01 versus lateral) and 89+/-16% of kibble (P=.01 versus lateral) swallows stimulated primary esophageal peristalsis. Other variables were not significantly different.
Forty-six percent of hospitalized foals had an inappropriately low basal cortisol concentration and 52% had an inadequate delta cortisol concentration after administration of the 100 microg dose of cosyntropin. An inadequate delta cortisol response to the high (100 microg) dose of cosyntropin was significantly correlated with shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in hospitalized foals, and with decreased survival in a subgroup of septic foals.
Abrupt increases in LAP, which averaged 16.7 mmHg, were observed at feeding periods. In contrast, strong diurnal LAP variations were found, with a significant but slight increase in daytime LAP compared with nighttime LAP.
2DST analyses were feasible in 16 of 18 echocardiographic studies. The automated tracking was accurate during systole but inaccurate during diastole. Reliability was higher for radial compared to circumferential measurements. For radial strain, radial systolic strain rate, and radial systolic displacement, the test-retest variabilities ranged between 2.4 and 33.1% for segmental and between 4.1 and 16.1% for averaged measurements.
In 1 litter of 5 pups all had an IHPSS. In the other litter 5 of 11 pups were affected. Both left- and right-sided shunts occurred in both litters. No sex predisposition was evident among affected dogs.
Polymorphisms in 5 genetic loci were strongly associated with CRP levels (% difference per minor allele): SNP rs6700896 in LEPR (-14.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.6% to -12.0%; P = 6.2 x 10(-22)), rs4537545 in IL6R (-11.5%; 95% CI, -14.4% to -8.5%; P = 1.3 x 10(-12)), rs7553007 in the CRP locus (-20.7%; 95% CI, -23.4% to -17.9%; P = 1.3 x 10(-38)), rs1183910 in HNF1A (-13.8%; 95% CI, -16.6% to -10.9%; P = 1.9 x 10(-18)), and rs4420638 in APOE-CI-CII (-21.8%; 95% CI, -25.3% to -18.1%; P = 8.1 x 10(-26)). Association of SNP rs7553007 in the CRP locus with coronary heart disease gave an odds ratio (OR) of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.01) per 20% lower CRP level. Our mendelian randomization study of variants in the CRP locus showed no association with coronary heart disease: OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.02; per 20% lower CRP level, compared with OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.95; predicted from meta-analysis of the observational studies of CRP levels and coronary heart disease (z score, -3.45; P &lt; .001). SNPs rs6700896 in LEPR (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.09; per minor allele), rs4537545 in IL6R (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.97), and rs4420638 in the APOE-CI-CII cluster (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.21) were all associated with risk of coronary heart disease.
During median follow-up of 12.8 years, there were 418 cardiovascular and 230 coronary events. Models with conventional risk factors had C statistics of 0.758 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.734 to 0.781) and 0.760 (0.730 to 0.789) for cardiovascular and coronary events, respectively. Biomarkers retained in backward-elimination models were CRP and N-BNP for cardiovascular events and MR-proADM and N-BNP for coronary events, which increased the C statistic by 0.007 (P = .04) and 0.009 (P = .08), respectively. The proportion of participants reclassified was modest (8% for cardiovascular risk, 5% for coronary risk). Net reclassification improvement was nonsignificant for cardiovascular events (0.0%; 95% CI, -4.3% to 4.3%) and coronary events (4.7%; 95% CI, -0.76% to 10.1%). Greater improvements were observed in analyses restricted to intermediate-risk individuals (cardiovascular events: 7.4%; 95% CI, 0.7% to 14.1%; P = .03; coronary events: 14.6%; 95% CI, 5.0% to 24.2%; P = .003). However, correct reclassification was almost entirely confined to down-classification of individuals without events rather than up-classification of those with events.
The nationwide usage of BMP has increased from 0.69% of all fusions in 2002 to 24.89% of all fusions in 2006. Use of BMP varied by patient sex, race, and primary payer with increased use seen in women (56.26% with BMP vs 53.35% without BMP; odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval, [CI], 1.09-1.16) and Medicare patients (29.62% with BMP vs 27.16% without BMP; OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.31-1.56) and decreased use in nonwhite patients (8.69% with BMP vs 10.23% without BMP; OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.85). When comparing immediate postoperative, in-hospital rates of complications for the year 2006 among patients undergoing spinal fusion by BMP use status, no differences were seen for lumbar, thoracic, or posterior cervical procedures. On univariate analysis and after multivariable adjustment, the use of BMP in anterior cervical fusion procedures was associated with a higher rate of complication occurrence (7.09% with BMP vs 4.68% without BMP; adjusted OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12-1.70) with the primary increases seen in wound-related complications (1.22% with BMP vs 0.65% without BMP; adjusted OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10- 2.53) and dysphagia or hoarseness (4.35% with BMP vs 2.45% without BMP; adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.05). Bone-morphogenetic protein use was associated with greater inpatient hospital charges across all categories of fusion. Increases between 11% and 41% of total hospital charges were reported, with the greatest percentage increase seen for anterior cervical fusion.
The serum potassium level significantly affected mental health, social functioning, symptoms, and the effect of kidney disease, with the 3.5-5.0 mEq/L target range group scoring higher than the &gt; or =5.1 mEq/L group.
The independent t-test results demonstrated that the means of the consciousness level at the first day before intervention had no significant difference in both groups. The repeated measured ANOVA results demonstrated that the consciousness level alterations were significant between the two groups over the 6 days of intervention.
The primiparas showed a significantly higher EPDS score than the multiparas. The EPDS score decreased with the frequency of delivery in the groups of mothers in their twenties and thirties. For the multiparas, the number of participants who suffered obstetric events was lower, the number of participants who went back to their home was higher, and the number of participants who were taken care of by their mother was lower than for the primiparas. General health abnormalities, sociability, and worries about baby care were significantly associated with the EPDS for both the primiparas and multiparas. The cooperation of the husband was associated with a decreased EPDS score, both for the primiparas and multiparas, irrespective of the family structure.
There were no differences in the incidence of depression and anxiety between the experimental and control groups. There were significant interaction effects between the program and time in the scores of the two subscales of SF-36 and the summary. There was no difference in satisfaction. The use of ovulation-enhancing agents showed that the scores of "role functioning physical" and "physical component summary" in the non-use subgroup were higher at 2 and 3 months in the experimental group, compared to the control group.
Of the 50 participants in the intervention group and the 25 participants in the control group, 42 and 23, respectively, completed the program (a completion rate of 84.0%). The body weight, HbA1c, self-efficacy, dietary and exercise stages, quality of life, diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol level were significant by two-way repeated-measures anova. As for changes over time within the groups, only the intervention group showed significant differences by Friedman's test. The complication prevention behaviors showed a high implementation rate in the intervention group. The overall evaluation of this program by the participants was very high and, therefore, they highly recognized the need for this type of program.
In the dry eye group, there were significant aggravations in Sx at 2 months postoperatively and in TMH at 3 days, 10 days, 1 month, and 2 months postoperatively, compared with preoperative values. All dry eye test values were significantly worse after cataract surgery in the non-dry eye group. With regard to incision location, there was no difference in tBUT, Sx, ST-I, or TMH in either the dry eye group or the non-dry eye group at any postoperative time point. Regarding incision shape, there was no difference in tBUT, Sx, ST-I or TMH at any postoperative time point in the dry eye group. In the superior incision sub-group of the non-dry eye group, tBUT and Sx were worse in the grooved incision group at day 1. In the temporal incision sub-group of the non-dry eye group, Sx were worse in the grooved incision group at 1 day, 3 days, and 10 days postoperatively. In both groups, significant correlations were noted between microscopic light exposure time and dry eye test values, but no correlation was noted between phacoemulsification energy and dry eye test values.
Visual acuity at the time of presentation was significantly worse in the C group than in the N group (p=0.005). The photoreceptor layer appeared to be double-layered due to a cystoid space in the C group. Layered structures and strands found in the cystoid space. Expanding sponge-form edema led to the development of a cystoid space in the photoreceptor layer. Intraretinal fluid resolved earlier than subretinal fluid. There were no observed differences in visual acuity between the two groups after four days of treatment.
The duration of intravitreal TA effects on macular thickness and visual acuity increased with increasing dosage. An observed increase in intraocular pressure induced by TA was not significantly associated with dosage.
Mean IOP reduced from 37.1+/-9.7 mmHg preoperatively to 15.2+/-5.6 mmHg at 12 months postoperatively (p&lt;0.001). Qualified success was achieved in 84.2% at 1 year. Hypotony with an IOP of &lt;6 mmHg was seen in 8.4% and an IOP of &lt;5 mmHg in 3.2% on the first postoperative day. No case of hypotony required surgical intervention. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage did not occur in this study. When stents were removed on the first postoperative day because of an insufficient IOP decrease, the mean IOP decreased significantly from 42.0 mmHg to 14.1 mmHg (p&lt;0.001) after 1 hour. The most common complication was hyphema, which occurred in 17.9%.
IMCs were found in the distal myotendinous regions of EOMs. The IMCs of patients with acquired strabismus showed no significant morphological alterations. However, significant IMCs alterations were observed at the distal myotendinous junction of patients with congenital strabismus and congenital nystagmus.
High-flow lesions were detected in nine patients and low-flow lesions were detected in 12 patients. On the vascular phase, the CT number of areas 1 and 2 of high-flow lesions was significantly higher than for low-flow lesions (p &lt; 0.05). Contrary to early peaks seen in time-density curves of high-flow lesions, low-flow lesions showed a delayed peak.
A residual AVM was identified in 10 patients (10 of 32, 31%) on X-ray angiography. The inter-observer agreement for MRA was excellent (kappa= 0.813). For the detection of a residual AVM after radiosurgery as determined by observer 1 and observer 2, the source images of MRA had an overall sensitivity of 100%/90% (10 of 10, 9 of 10), specificity of 68%/68% (15 of 22, 15 of 22), positive predictive value of 59%/56% (10 of 17, 9 of 16), negative predictive value of 100%/94% (15 of 15, 15 of 16) and diagnostic accuracy of 78%/75% (25 of 32, 24 of 32), respectively.
The estimated effective dose was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv. The mean heart rate was 63 +/- 12 bpm (range, 44-101 bpm). The patient BMIs were 24.5 +/- 4.5 kg/m(2) (range, 15.5-42.3 kg/m(2)). The mean and median interscan variabilities were 11% and 6%, respectively by volume, and 11% and 6%, respectively, by mass. Moreover, the mean and median of the algorithms were lower than the Agatston algorithm (16% and 9%, respectively). The mean and median interobserver variability was 10% and 4%, respectively (average of algorithms). The mean noise levels were 15 +/- 4 Hounsfield unit (HU) (range, 8-25 HU). The interscan and interobserver variability was not correlated with heart rate, BMI, or noise level.
The mean heart rate during the scan was 71.8 bpm, whereas the mean Agatston score was 226.5. Of the 1,588 segments examined, 1,533 (97%) were assessable. A total of 17 patients had calcium scores above 400 Agatston U, whereas 50 had heart rates &gt;or= 70 bpm. Overall the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for significant stenoses were: 95%, 91%, 65%, and 99% (by segment), respectively and 97%, 90%, 81%, and 91% (by artery), respectively (n = 475). Heart rate showed no significant impact on lesion detection; however, vessel calcification did show a significant impact on accuracy of assessment for coronary segments. The specificity, PPV and accuracy were 96%, 80%, and 96% (by segment), respectively for an Agatston score less than 100% and 99%, 96% and 98% (by artery). For an Agatston score of greater to or equal to 400 the specificity, PPV and accuracy were reduced to 79%, 55%, and 83% (by segment), respectively and to 79%, 69%, and 85% (by artery), respectively.
Of the 46 patients, 17 patients were surgically confirmed as having a high-type IA, three patients were confirmed as having an intermediate-type IA and 26 patients were confirmed as having a low-type IA. The IA type was correctly diagnosed by the use of transperineal US in 39 of the 46 patients (85%). In 14 of the 17 patients with a high-type IA, internal fistulas were correctly identified. All cases with a P-P distance &gt; 16 mm were high-type IAs and all cases with a P-P distance &lt; 5 mm were low-type IAs.
The bleeding esophageal artery directly originated from the aorta in four patients and from the left inferior phrenic artery in one patient. Although four patients had an underlying coagulopathy at the time of the TAE, angiographic and clinical success was achieved in all five patients. In addition, no procedure-related complications such as esophageal infarction were observed during this study.
There were no major complications and minor complications were noted in three patients (7%) including one case of vasovagal syncope and two cases of bilomas. Wall thickening of the gallbladder adjacent to the RF ablation zone was noted in 14 patients (41%) as determined on immediate follow-up CT imaging. Wall thickening showed complete disappearance on subsequent follow-up CT imaging. The primary technique effectiveness rate was 96% (44/46) based on one-month follow-up CT imaging. Local tumor progression was noted in six (14%) of 44 completely ablated tumors during the follow-up period. The direction of electrode insertion (perpendicular), tumor size (&gt;or=3 cm) and tumor location (a tumor that abutted the gallbladder) were associated with an increased risk of early incomplete treatment. No variable was significantly associated with local tumor progression.
The procedure was technically successful in all 99 cysts from the 21 patients. Any procedure-related significant complications were not detected. Seventy-seven of 99 cysts (78%) were successfully collapsed on the follow-up CT. Twenty-two cysts showed reaccumulation during long-term follow-up period. The clinical symptoms were relieved in 17 of the 21 patients (76%). Four of 12 patients (33%) with hypertension and two of six patients (33%) with azotemia were improved. End stage renal disease (ESRD) occurred in six of the 21 patients (28%) during the follow-up period. The mean age of ESRD in our patients was 57 years. The mean time interval for the development of ESRD was 19 months.
The angiographies revealed a negative bleeding focus in 75 of 143 (52%) patients. The incidence of an angiographically negative outcome was significantly higher in patients with a stable hemodynamic status (p &lt; 0.001), or in patients with lower GI bleeding (p = 0.032). A follow-up of the 75 patients (range: 0-72 months, mean: 8 +/- 14 months) revealed that 60 of the 75 (80%) patients with a negative bleeding focus underwent conservative management only, and acute bleeding was controlled without rebleeding. Three of the 75 (4%) patients underwent exploratory surgery due to prolonged bleeding; however, no bleeding focus was detected. Rebleeding occurred in 12 of 75 (16%) patients. Of these, six patients experienced massive rebleeding and died of disseminated intravascular coagulation within four to nine hours after the rebleeding episode. Four of the 16 patients underwent a repeat angiography and the two remaining patients underwent a surgical intervention to control the bleeding.
Of the 36 patients, 17 had angiography-proven bleeding that was distal to the marginal artery. The remaining 19 patients did not have a bleeding focus based on the angiography results. The technical and clinical success rates of performing transcatheter microcoil embolizations in patients with active bleeding were 100% and 88%, respectively (15 of 17). One patient died from continued LGI bleeding and one patient received surgery to treat the continued bleeding. There was no note made on the delayed bleeding or on the major or minor complications. Of the 19 patients without active bleeding, 16 (84%) did not have recurrent bleeding. One patient died due to continuous bleeding and multi-organ failure.
Of the several methods investigated, introduction of genes into S. ipomoeae could only be achieved using intergeneric conjugation from Escherichia coli. However, even results for that method varied greatly and were dependent on using particular media for S. ipomoeae spore preparation and conjugation. Transconjugant to recipient ratios as great as 4.1 x 10(-5) were achieved when International Streptomyces Project Medium 4 was used for both sporulation and conjugation protocols. Both site-specifically integrating and autonomously replicating plasmids could be introduced and maintained in S. ipomoeae, and plasmids could be introduced with approximate equivalent frequencies from either methyl-proficient or methyl- deficient E. coli donors; the latter result indicates a likely absence of relevant methyl-specific restriction in S. ipomoeae.
A panel of 68 nontyphoidal Salmonella strains was characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis and susceptibility to antibiotics. The majority of tested strains were genetically different, with 40% resistant to at least one antibiotic. E. coli Mcc24 showed highest in vitro activity against Salmonella (100%, microcin 24), followed by E. coli L1000 (94%, microcin B17), E. coli 53 (49%, colicin H) and E. coli 52 (21%, colicin G) as revealed using a cross-streak activity assay.
Ralstonia eutropha strain AAJ1 isolated from soil was found to degrade phorate (supplied as sole carbon source) upto 85% in 10 days in liquid medium. Half-life (t((1/2))) of phorate in the liquid medium in control (uninoculated) and in experimental (inoculated with R. eutropha, strain AAJ1) samples was recorded as 36.49 and 6.29 days, respectively. Kinetics revealed that phorate degradation depends on time and the reaction follows the first order kinetics. Diethyl dithiophosphate was one of the degradation products, which is markedly less toxic than the parent compound; other degradation products included phorate sulfoxide and phorate sulfone. Release of inorganic phosphates and sulfates indicated the potential of the isolate to further degrade the above-mentioned metabolites to simpler forms. The strain was also found to poses phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase enzymatic activity, which are involved in biodegradation of organophosphorus compounds.
Six strains of Weissella cibaria produced large amounts (2.2-3.2 mmol l(-1)) of hydrogen peroxide in GYP broth supplemented with sodium acetate, but very low accumulations in glucose yeast peptone broth without sodium acetate. Increased production of hydrogen peroxide was also recorded when strains of W. cibaria were cultured in the presence of potassium acetate, sodium isocitrate and sodium citrate. Oxidases and peroxidases were not detected, or were present at low levels in W. cibaria. However, strong nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase activity was recorded, suggesting that the enzyme plays a key role in production of hydrogen peroxide by W. cibaria.
Fifty-six clinical strains of E. faecalis, isolated from patients hospitalized in the period of 1999-2004 in several wards in Wrocław (Poland), were analysed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA). Analysis of seven genomic loci identified 40 novel genotypes among the analysed E. faecalis strains, with two major genomic groups, designated I and II, distinguished at a cut-off of 35%. With a similarity cut-off of 85.7%, the genotypes could be combined into 12 clusters (C1-C12), containing at least two isolates. The remaining 18 MLVA types were represented by a single isolate.
An industrial brewer's yeast strain (Ts-10) was constructed by integrating glucoamylase encoding gene GAI amplified from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera by PCR into the locus of proteinase A (PrA) gene (PEP4). The resulting recombinant strain identified by PCR could grow on YNB minimal medium plate with starch as sole carbon source. Its highest GAI activity was 91.69 U ml(-1), but it had no PrA activity. The real extract was reduced by 21.07% and the main residual maltotriose content was reduced by 14% in wort fermented with the recombinants strain. Its foam retention in beer was higher 39 s and the contents of potential off-flavour compounds, such as diacetyl, pentanedione and acetaldehyde were lowered by 16%, 13% and 14%, respectively, as compared with the industrial brewer's yeast YSF-5.
Different culturing methods, viz, cell immobilization on stainless steel sponges and plastic material and solid-state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran as substrate were used for laccase production by the white-rot fungus F. fomentarius. The SSF study expresses the highest laccase activities, nearly to 6400 U l(-1) after 13 days of laboratory flasks cultivation. When the wheat bran medium was supplemented with 2 mmol l(-1) copper sulfate, laccase activity increased by threefold in comparison to control cultures, reaching 27 864 U l(-1). With the medium thus optimized, further experiments were performed in a 3 l fixed-bed bioreactor (working volume 1.5 l) leading to a laccase activity of about 6230 U l(-1) on day 13.
The method was based on coupling International Standard Organization (ISO) enrichment to a real-time PCR with internal amplification control (IAC), in a duplex format, without additional DNA purification. The performance was tested on different plant products. Both bacterial pathogens were consistently detected with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 CFU in 25 g after enrichment, except for soybean sprouts. Levels of S. enterica, ranging from 1 to 10 CFU in 25 g after enrichment were detected with different enrichment broths.
After epiphytic sterilization, 145 fungal endophytes were isolated from the stem, annual twig and seed of Acer ginnala. The endophytes were grouped into ten different taxa, Phomopsis sp., Neurospora sp., Phoma sp., Epicoccum sp., Penicillium sp., Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp., Trichoderma sp., Cladosporium sp. and a species of Pleosporales Incertae Sedis, by their morphological traits and ITS-rDNA sequence analysis. The content and yield of gallic acid of 141 isolates were determined by HPLC. On average, the species of Pleosporales Incertae Sedis had the highest content and yield of gallic acid (13.28 mg g(-1) DW; 119.62 mg l(-1)), while Alternaria sp. had the lowest.
Eighty-seven Aeromonas isolates belonging to Aeromonas hydrophila (n = 41) and Aer. jandaei (n = 46) species were tested for MBL production by the combined disk test using imipenem and meropenem disks as substrates and EDTA or thioglycolic acid as inhibitors. The presence of MBL genes was investigated by PCR and sequencing using new consensus primer pairs designed in this study. The cphA gene was found in 97.6% and 100% of Aer. hydrophila and Aer. jandaei isolates, respectively, whereas the acquired MBL genes bla(IMP), bla(VIM) and bla(SPM-1) were not detected. On the other hand, production of MBL activity was detectable in 87.8% and 10.9% of the cphA-positive Aer. hydrophila and Aer. jandaei isolates respectively.
Both cell number and colony volume of Salmonella Typhimurium in gelatin were monitored during the exponential and the stationary phase with varying pH and water activity, by plate counts and microscopic image analysis respectively. The exponential growth rates of cell numbers and colony volumes were correlated. The exponential growth rate of cell numbers was estimated based on this correlation and a secondary model that describes the effect of pH and water activity on the growth rate of the colony volumes. During the stationary phase, the cell number was constant, while colony volume increased, thus indicating the formation of a dead fraction. Models were developed to describe the living and dead population.
Bacterial counts of overnight cultures showed that whilst growth of Staphylococcus aureus 50084 was impaired in the presence of milled leaves, the phenol-free fraction of holocellulose of S. papillosum had no bacteriostatic effect. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of an acetone-methanol extract of the leaves detected eight phenolic compounds. Antibacterial activity of the four dominating phenols specific to Sphagnum leaves, when assessed in vitro as minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were generally &gt;2.5 mg ml(-1). MIC values of the Sphagnum-specific compound 'sphagnum acid' [p-hydroxy-beta-(carboxymethyl)-cinnamic acid] were &gt;5 mg ml(-1). No synergistic or antagonistic effects of the four dominating phenols were detected in plate assays.
Using 130 clinical specimens, the results obtained by the multiplex PCR, previously established in-house PCR and COBAS Amplicor PCR assays were compared. The specimens frequently contained multiple pathogens (34/130 specimens). The multiplex PCR assay had an overall sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100% compared to the in-house PCR assay at &gt;20 microg ml(-1) of DNA concentrations in samples and there was no cross-reaction with nonpathogenic Neisseria species that cause the majority of false-positive results with the COBAS Amplicor PCR assay.
About 86 E. coli strains previously isolated from 172 healthy sheep from different farms were studied. PCR was used for detection of stx(1), stx(2), eae, ehxA and saa genes and for the identification of intimin subtypes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-PCR was performed to investigate the variants of stx(1) and stx(2), and the flagellar antigen (fliC) genes in nonmotile isolates. Five isolates were eae(+) and stx(-), and belonged to serotypes O128:H2/beta-intimin (2), O145:H2/gamma, O153:H7/beta and O178:H7/epsilon. Eighty-one STEC isolates were recovered, and the stx genotypes identified were stx(1c)stx(2d-O118) (46.9%), stx(1c) (27.2%), stx(2d-O118) (23.4%), and stx(1c)stx(2dOX3a) (2.5%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed 27 profiles among 53 STEC and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) isolates.
A Gram-negative, rod shaped, cream white coloured strain Pantoea NII-186 isolated from Western Ghat soil sample. The taxonomic position of the bacterium was confirmed by sequencing of 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis. A strain grew at a wide range of temperature ranging from 5-40 degrees C, but optimum growth was observed at 28-30 degrees C. It showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity, indole acetic acid (IAA) production, siderophore production and HCN production. It was able to solubilize (28 microg of Ca(3)PO(4) ml(-1) day(-1)), and produce IAA (59 microg) at 28 degrees C. The solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associates with a drop in the pH of the culture medium. Pantoea sp. NII-186 tolerate to different environmental stresses like 5-40 degrees C, 0-7% salt concentration and 4-12 pH range.
A mutant gene spt15 (Phe(177)Ser, Tyr(195)His, Lys(218)Arg) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The fermentation properties of the engineered strains in very high gravity fermentations were investigated. It is found that overexpression of SPT3 can enhance the resistance to ethanol and osmotic stress. On the contrary, overexpression of SPT15 or spt15 cannot obviously improve osmotic and ethanol tolerance of industrial strains. Additionally, simultaneous overexpression of SPT15 and SPT3 can not only distinctly enhance the resistance to ethanol and osmotic stress, but also improve fermentation performance.
Using Escherichia coli, the Y(rrn) of which is known to be 7, as a reference, the rrn concentrations of target species and E. coli in sample solutions were measured based on their respective threshold cycle numbers (C(t)), whereas the cell concentrations of both species were measured by microscopic counting after staining. The Y(rrn) of the target species was then calculated from the initial cell concentrations and the rrn concentrations of the target species and E. coli. Using this method, the Y(rrn) values of four species, i.e. Xanthomonas campestris, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens, were estimated as 1.80, 4.73, 8.58 and 5.13, respectively, comparable to their respective known values of 2, 5, 10, and 5, resulting in an average deviation of 8%.
Fresh sheep and beef-cattle faeces, dairy cattle slurry and beef cattle farm yard manure (FYM) were collected from commercial units in south-west England and applied to 20 randomized 1 m(2) plots established on permanent grassland. Representative samples from each faecal matrix (n = 5) were collected on four occasions over 16 days. One gram of each sample was transferred to a sterile vial to which 9 ml of standard local rain was carefully pipetted. The vial was then rotated through 360 degrees, 20 times in 60 s to 'simulate' a standardized interaction of the faecal material with rainfall, providing an assay of comparative release potential. Appropriate decimal dilutions were prepared from the eluent. Following agitation, with a sterile spatula, the remaining faecal material and eluent in the vials were vortex mixed for 60 s before decimal dilutions were prepared from the resulting mixture, providing a quantitative assessment of the total FIO in the sample from which percentage release could be determined. Bacterial concentrations were enumerated in duplicate by membrane filtration following standard methods for FIO. Significant differences in release kinetics of Escherichia coli and enterococci from each of the faecal matrices were determined.
Lipase activity values of 9.5 U ml(-1) in 96 h of fermentation was obtained at the maximized operational conditions of peptone, yeast extract, NaCl and olive oil concentrations (g l(-1)) of 20.0, 5.0, 5.0 and of 10.0 respectively. The partial characterization of crude enzymatic extract obtained by submerged fermentation showed optimum activity at pH range from 4.9 to 5.5 and temperature from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C. The crude extract maintained its initial activity at freezing temperatures up to 100 days.
We optimized substrate types and culture conditions including inoculum size and temperature. The optimal growth of M. rouxii was found in the cultures inoculated with 5 x 10(5) spores g(-1) substrate. The fungal cells grew well on rice bran and soy bean meal, whereas a lower biomass was found in the cultures grown on polished rice, broken rice and spent malt grain. The GLA content was highly accumulated in rice bran ferment and its maximal content of about 6 g kg(-1) fermented mass was observed in the 5th-day culture grown at 30 degrees C. However, the GLA content in the rice bran ferment was not enhanced by low temperature.
A high-throughput two-step screening assay was developed using 96-well plates in which fungal growth and siderophore production is assessed spectrophotometrically. If a compound inhibits growth only in iron-limited medium (screen 1), its effect on siderophore production is then determined (screen 2). The proof of concept was demonstrated using a known antifungal agent, amphotericin B, and a strain of A. fumigatus deficient in siderophore production.
Cyanide production was assayed for during the growth of P. entomophila in liquid culture and during colonial growth. Pseudomonas entomophila produced HCN at a concentration of up to 40 micromol l(-1) during growth in liquid cultures and its production was found to be affected by oxygen availability, with levels increasing as the oxygen-transfer coefficient decreased. Pseudomonas entomophila made HCN during colonial growth at levels greater (approximately threefold) than those made by the well studied cyanogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The total number of mandatory and nonmandatory ethics consultations requested was 168. Of these consultations, 108 (64%) were considered mandatory, and 60 (36%) were considered nonmandatory. Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007, the total number of ethics consultations increased 84%.
The functional class evaluations were completed by 113 clinicians, 87 (77%) of whom had participated in PAH trials; 106 (94%) reported using functional class when determining therapy. Clinicians reported a broad range of factors they considered when evaluating functional class, and their assessments of functional class varied widely. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.58 for the initial patient survey and 0.62 for the online survey. At best, one patient was ranked as either class II (by 60 clinicians [53%]) or class III (by 53 [47%]). Clinicians' rankings spanned at least 3 functional classes for each of the other patients. Equally divergent rankings were observed among nurses and physicians. Cluster analysis identified clinicians' tendencies toward "higher" or "lower" functional class rankings. Of the 113 clinicians, 101 (89%) thought that the patients described resembled those seen in their practices.
The viability of SMMC-7721 cells decreased with increasing dose of the carbon ion beam, and the high-LET carbon ion beam led to the cells getting arrested at G(2)/M phase. Western Blot analyses show that STAT-3 expression increased with increasing radiation dose. The carbon ion irradiation induced cell apoptosis and significantly promoted the expression of STAT-3 gene compared with the X-ray irradiation. The apoptosis rate is correlated with the expression of STAT-3 in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells after exposure to different doses of X-ray and heavy ion beam.
CADO prevented the occurrence of apoptosis in the remote myocardium of an infarcted heart. This effect occured not only when CADO was started before the onset of ischemia but also when it started 3 h after the infarction. The anti-apoptotic effect of CADO was blocked by simultaneous administration of the selective adenosine A2b receptor antagonist MRS1754 (1 mg/kg). The anti-apoptotic effect of CADO seems to be mediated by g(alphaq) and by the activation of survival kinases (Bad) and by inhibition of the pro-apoptotic PKC-delta/p38-MAPK-pathway.
JWH015 (a CBR2 agonist) increased MKP-1 and MKP-3 expression, which in turn reduced p-ERK1/2 in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. These effects resulted in a significant reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) expression and microglial migration. We confirmed the causative link of these findings by using MKP inhibitors. We found that the selective inhibition of MKP-1 by Ro-31-8220 and PSI2106, did not affect p-ERK expression in LPS+JWH015-treated microglia. However, the inhibition of both MKP-1 and MKP-3 by triptolide induced an increase in p-ERK expression and in microglial migration using LPS+JWH015-treated microglia.
This study characterizes properties of LTP at synapses of C-fibers onto neurons in the superficial DH following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of a peripheral nerve at an intensity that activates C-fibers and examines associated activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein kinase II (p-CaMKII), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) and expression of c-Fos, and it investigates further roles for the EphB1 receptor in LTP. HFS induced LTP within 5 min and lasts for 3-8 h during the period of recording and resulted in upregulation of p-CaMKII, p-ERK and p-CREB protein levels in the spinal cord and expression of c-Fos in DH. Intrathecal pretreatment of MK-801 or EphB2-Fc prevented LTP and significantly reduced upregulation of p-CaMKII, p-ERK, p-CREB and c-Fos. Further, targeted mutation of EphB1 receptor prevented induction of LTP and associated increases in phosphorylation of CaMKII, ERK, and CREB.
Of 164 pancreatic cancers, 98 (60%) were positive for LMO2 expression. LMO2 was more frequently detected in high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions (PanIN-2 and -3) than in low-grade PanIN lesions (PanIN-1A and -1B; P &lt; .001) and was not detected in normal pancreatic ductal epithelium. The LMO2 messenger RNA levels were significantly higher in invasive ductal carcinoma cells than in normal pancreatic cells as evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of microdissected cells (P = .036). We also found higher incidence of LMO2 expression in histologic grade G1/G2 cancers than in grade G3 cancers (P &lt; .001). The median survival time of LMO2-positive patients was significantly longer than that of LMO2-negative patients (P &lt; .001), and multivariate analyses revealed that high LMO2 expression was an independent predictor of longer survival (risk ratio, 0.432, P &lt; .001). Even among patients with a positive operative margin, LMO2-positive patients had a significant survival benefit compared with LMO2-negative patients. We further performed a large cohort study (n = 113) to examine the LMO2 messenger RNA levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and found similar results.
We first tested which signaling pathways mediate T4's rapid modulation of sodium current (I(Na)) by perturbing specific pathways associated with nongenomic thyroid hormone signaling. We found that pharmacological blockade of protein phosphatase 1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 isoform decreased and increased tonic sodium current amplitudes, respectively, and blockade of either occluded rapid responses to acute T4 application. We next tested for the ion channel target of rapid T4 signaling via morpholino knock-down of specific sodium channel isotypes. We found that selective knock-down of the sodium channel alpha-subunit Na(v)1.6a, but not Na(v)1.1la, occluded T4's acute effects. We also determined the spatial and temporal distribution of a nongenomic T4 receptor, integrin alphaVbeta3. At 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), immunofluorescent assays showed no specific integrin alphaVbeta3 immunoreactivity in wild-type zebrafish embryos. However, by 48 hpf, embryos expressed integrin alphaVbeta3 in RBs and primary motoneurons. Consistent with this temporal expression, T4 modulated RB I(Na) at 48 but not 24 hpf. We next tested whether T4 rapidly modulated I(Na) of caudal primary motoneurons, which express the receptor (alphaVbeta3) and target (Na(v)1.6a) of rapid T4 signaling. In response to T4, caudal primary motoneurons rapidly increased sodium current peak amplitude 1.3-fold.
Using newly identified dI1- and dI2-specific enhancers to trace axonal trajectories originating from these interneurons, we found that each population is subdivided into several distinct groups according to their axonal pathways. dI1 neurons project axons rostrally, either ipsi- or contra-laterally, while dI2 are mostly commissural neurons that project their axons rostrally and caudally. The longitudinal axonal tracks of each neuronal population self-fasciculate to form dI1- and dI2-specific bundles. The dI1 bundles are spatially located ventral relative to dI2 bundles. To examine the functional contribution of Lim-HD proteins to establishment of dI axonal projections, the Lim-HD code of dI neurons was altered by cell-specific ectopic expression. Expression of Lhx1 in dI1 neurons caused a repression of Lhx2/9 and imposed caudal projection to the caudal commissural dI1 neurons. Complementarily, when expressed in dI2 neurons, Lhx9 repressed Lhx1/5 and triggered a bias toward rostral projection in otherwise caudally projecting dI2 neurons, and ventral shift of the longitudinal axonal fascicule.
GA infusion into the mouse brain led to the up-regulation of hsp 70.1.
In the subventricular zone (SVZ), there was positive double-staining starting at day 3 showing proliferating astrocytic precursors (nestin + GFAP, 5-20% of cells), neuronal stem cells (nestin + PCNA, 95% of cells) and neuronal precursors (nestin + beta-tubulin, 50% of cells). Within the penumbra, a more robust response showed more astrocytic precursors (50-80% of cells), premature and differentiated oligodendrocytes, neuronal stem cells (85% of cells) and neuronal precursors (15% of cells). In the area of the stroke, there was an intermediate response consisting of more astrocytic precursors (10-20% of cells), premature oligodendrocytes (45-100% of cells), neuronal stem cells (95% of cells) and neuronal precursors (25% of cells). Results were confirmed with cell counting analysis.
Exposure of PC12 cells to 1% oxygen for 6 hours decreased IL-7 mRNA by 77% using RT-PCR (p&lt;0.01). Exposure to 1% oxygen for 24 hours decreased IL-7 protein in the medium by 21% (p&lt;0.05). As hypoxia duration increased (2, 4, 6 and 24 hours) or oxygen concentrations decreased (10%, 5% and 1%), IL-7 mRNA expression progressively decreased. Removal of extracellular free Ca(2+) completely prevented these hypoxia-induced decreases of IL-7 mRNA.
The mean ESR level on the day before surgery was 8.26 +/- 7.27 mm/h after 1 hour and 14.80 +/- 10.36 mm/h after 2 hours. After tumor surgery, ESR increased stepwise. The mean peak value of 22.89 +/- 13.41 mm/h after the first hour was reached on the third post-operative day. Whereas mean values varied over time, ESR remained increased and did not decline to normal values until the tenth post-operative day. The mean ESR peak value was higher in patients having undergone surgery for intra-axial lesions (31.36 +/- 30.43 mm/h on the post-operative day 6) as compared to patients with extra-axial lesions (21.31 +/- 12.20 mm/h on the post-operative day 3).
The number of TH positive cells was increased from 1.53 +/- 0.12 to 3.83 +/- 0.56% after the cells were transfected with Nurr1. Increased endogenous Nurr1 by RA lead to 1.8 times (2.86 +/- 0.32% versus 1.53 +/- 0.12% in the controls) increase in TH positive cells. A double inducing effect by both endogenous and exogenous Nurr1 on the expression of TH was observed by 3.3 times increase in the positive cells (from 5.03 +/- 0.76 to 1.53 +/- 0.12% in control). Ret expression was induced by overexpression of Nurr1. Overexpressed Ret had no inducing effect on the expression of Nurr1 and the number of TH positive cells. The gene of dopamine transporter (DAT) was clearly induced in the cells transfected with Ret.
The intraclass correlation coefficients for the N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios were 0.93, 0.89, 0.9 and 0.8 for the posterior cingulate gyrus, occipital, prefrontal and temporal regions, respectively, with the GE software. For the LCModel, the coefficients were 0.9, 0.89, 0.87 and 0.84, respectively. For the absolute value of NAA, the GE software was also slightly more reproducible than LCModel. However, for the choline/Cr and myo-inositol/Cr ratios, the LCModel was more reliable than the GE software. The variability we have seen hovers around the percentages observed in previous reports (around 10% for the NAA/Cr ratios).
The mean clinical benefit, based on a 0-3 scale (0=no effect, 1=slight, 2=moderate and 3=marked improvement) was similar for Dysport (2.5 +/- 0.3) and Botox (2.2 +/- 0.4). Adverse events were mild and similar for both products. Fewer than 2% of the patients developed neutralizing antibodies.
Leptomeningeal gliomas grew in all Wistar rats after the administration of 1 x 10(7) C6 glioma cells. Intracranial hypertension, weight loss and cachexia developed, and the median survival time was 18.0 +/- 2.9 days. The glioma mass distributed throughout the ventricles, the leptomeningeal regions in the brain and the brainstem, with typical pathological features of glioblastoma. The immunohistochemistry stainings showed high Ki-67 labeling index (42.1 +/- 10.3%), and concomitant overexpression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 suggested proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis potential.
Our results show that about two-thirds of projections to the septal area terminate in the LS. They mostly originate ipsilaterally from the septal area itself (8%), hippocampal formation (38%), non-specific thalamic nuclei (23%), lateral pre-optic area, lateral hypothalamus, perifornical area and mammillary complex in hypothalamus (20%), ventral tegmental area, raphe and tegmental nuclei, and also locus coeruleus in brainstem (10%). Most afferents to the MS come ipsilaterally from the septal area itself (18%), hippocampal formation (12%), lateral pre-optic area, lateral hypothalamus and mammillary complex in hypothalamus (42%), ventral tegmental area, raphe and tegmental nuclei, central gray matter and also locus coeruleus in brainstem (20%). Some afferents to the septal area originate contralaterally from the lateral hypothalamus, supramammillary area, raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus.
Functional recovery was related to the difference in motoneuron number between the injured and the uninjured sides of the spinal cord of the operated animals. On the one side, only in the rats in which the inferior trunk was immediately repaired, the difference in motoneuron number between the two sides of the spinal cord was not statistically significant; these animals showed a good axonal regeneration and function recovery. On the other side, in the rats in which the inferior trunk was left unrepaired or tardy repaired, the decrease in motoneuron number in the injured side compared with the uninjured side of the spinal cord was statistically significant; these animals showed no axonal regeneration and no function recovery.
The patients' mean age in both studies was between 50 and 59 years. Both studies underlined the preponderance of female patients for intracranial meningiomas. In the primary study, there were 506 female and 208 male patients, and in the new study, there were 366 female and 97 male patients. The gender distribution changed from 2.4 : 1 to 3.8 : 1. Complete removal of the tumor was possible in 86.7% in both studies. The recurrence rate in the first study was 11% (73/661), while it was 16% in the second study (73/463). The intracranial localization of the meningiomas was similar to the distribution of the histological subtypes and the rate of recurrence; only the malignant meningiomas showed a higher grade of recurrence in the last study. Indications for post-operative radiation therapy were given earlier in the last study owing to the experience from the primary study. The outcome of the patients after surgical removal was improving in the last years; the 30 day post-operative mortality after a primary operation on an intracranial meningioma decreased from 12.1 to 3%. After removal of a recurrent meningioma, the mortality declined from 20 to 12.5%.
There was a statistically significant difference between the mean degeneration scores of the control and SAH only groups (p&lt;0.05). The level of neural degeneration in TPM treated group was significantly lower compared with SAH only group (p&lt;0.05), but not significantly higher than the control group (p&gt;0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between arterial cross-sectional area and arterial wall thickness measurements of the SAH group and SAH + TPM group.
Four themes encapsulating the participants' journeys through clinical situations were identified; (a) creating learning opportunities, (b) gaining independence, (c) becoming part of the team and (d) generational differences. The themes reflect the development of novice nurses and the nuances of the workplace as a learning environment.
The focus group data revealed that a number of students were resistant to the use of information and communication technology as an educational methodology and lacked the requisite skills and confidence to engage successfully with this educational approach. Survey results indicated that 26 per cent of students were unsure about the relevance of information and communication technology to clinical practice and only 50 per cent felt 'very confident' using a computer.
Attitudes towards older people were more positive in final year students in comparison to first year ones in both schools. Knowledge was found better only in relation to physical health in the final year students, in both schools. Age and female gender were found to influence both attitudes and knowledge positively.
Overall, nursing students perceived the DVD simulations positively in relation to learning attention (M=4.93, SD=1.02, CI 4.25-4.54), learning potential (M=4.45, SD= 1.30, CI 5.13-5.50), clinical relevance to practice (M=5.32, SD=0.65, CI 4.36-4.55), and information processing quality (M=5.62, SD= 1.02, CI 5.47-5.76). The following themes emerged from the focus groups: provided familiarisation for clinical placements, learning wastage occurs in varying amounts, simulations could replace some clinical placement rotations, supportive of multidisciplinary approach and integration, and simulations should have pedagogical integration into weekly clinical cases.
No statistically significant difference was found between the GER values or the blood glucose levels following the two meals when evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test.
Fatty acid composition data showed significant increase in palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) acid levels, which were reflected in increased desaturation index (16:1/16:0 and 18:1/18:0) in plasma and all the tissues of obese rats of both strains, when compared with their respective age and sex-matched lean rats. Further, we found a strong positive correlation between desaturation index, BMI and AI in plasma and most of the tissues analyzed.
In this study, participants played a computer game designed to measure risk taking (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task) fifteen minutes after completing a stress challenge or control task. Stress increased risk taking among men but decreased it among women.
After a 6-h baseline period of sleep/wake polysomnographic recording, cats underwent 6 h of continuous waking combined with monocular deprivation (MD) to trigger synaptic remodeling. Cats subsequently received an i.p. injection of either vehicle, trazodone (10 mg/kg), zaleplon (10 mg/kg), or eszopiclone (1-10 mg/kg), and were allowed an 8-h period of post-MD sleep before ocular dominance plasticity was assessed. We found that while zaleplon and eszopiclone had profound effects on sleeping cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, only trazodone (which did not alter EEG activity) significantly impaired sleep-dependent consolidation of ocular dominance plasticity. This was associated with deficits in both the normal depression of V1 neuronal responses to deprived-eye stimulation, and potentiation of responses to non-deprived eye stimulation, which accompany ocular dominance plasticity.
The structural basis of proteolytic and autotransport activity was investigated using transposon-based linker scanning mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis and structure-function analysis derived from homology modelling of the EspP passenger domain. Transposon mutagenesis of the passenger domain inactivated autotransport when pentapeptide linker insertions occurred in regions essential for overall correct folding or in a loop protruding from the beta-helical core. Loss of proteolytic function was limited to mutations in Domain 1 in the N-terminal third of the EspP passenger. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that His(127), Asp(156) and Ser(263) in Domain 1 form the catalytic triad of EspP.
We searched LexisNexis to identify medical research reported on front pages of major newspapers published from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002. We used MEDLINE and Google Scholar to find journal articles corresponding to the research, and determined their evidence level. Of 734 front-page medical research stories identified, 417 (57%) referred to mature research published in peer-reviewed journals. The remaining 317 stories referred to preliminary findings presented at scientific or press meetings; 144 (45%) of those stories mentioned studies that later matured (i.e. were published in journals within 3 years after news coverage). The evidence-level distribution of the 515 journal articles quoted in news stories reporting on mature research (3% level I, 21% level II, 42% level III, 4% level IV, and 31% level V) differed from that of the 170 reports of preliminary research that later matured (1%, 19%, 35%, 12%, and 33%, respectively; chi-square test, P = .0009). No news stories indicated evidence level. Fewer than 1 in 5 news stories reporting preliminary findings acknowledged the preliminary nature of their content.
This study shows that the lack of exon 7 does not affect (homo-) dimerization. Moreover, the interaction of FOXP3Delta2Delta7 to RUNX1, NFAT and NF-kB appeared to be unchanged in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and reporter gene assays, when compared to FOXP3fl and FOXP3Delta2. Nevertheless, retroviral transduction with FOXP3Delta2Delta7 failed to induce the typical Treg-associated phenotype. The expression of FOXP3-induced surface molecules such as CD25 and CTLA-4 were not enhanced in FOXP3Delta2Delta7 transduced CD4+ T cells, which also failed to exhibit any suppressive capacity. Notably, however, co-expression of FOXP3fl with FOXP3Delta2Delta7 resulted in a reduction of CD25 expression by a dominant negative effect.
A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is IFNalpha, a cytokine strongly induced by LDV infection. Neutralization of IFNalpha in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro. Since the primary source of virus-induced IFNalpha in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's), we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation. Depletion of pDC's in vivo eradicated both the LDV-induced IFNalpha response and lymphocyte activation. A primary receptor in pDC's for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pattern recognition receptor. Infection of TLR7-knockout mice revealed that both the IFNalpha response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo. Interestingly, virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFNalpha response.
Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CHI3L1 including rs4950928 were genotyped in 6514 individuals. Asthma was defined as self-reported history of physician-diagnosed asthma. Total IgE and specific IgE to inhalant allergens were measured on serum samples. Lung function was measured by spirometry. Homozygosity of the rs4950928 G allele as compared to homozygosity of the C allele was associated with self-reported physician diagnosed asthma (OR 1.5 (95% CI, 1.00-2.26)) and with prevalence of atopic asthma (OR 1.93 (95% CI, 1.21-3.07)) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, socio-economic class and BMI. Carriers of rs883125 G allele had a significantly lower prevalence of atopy (OR 0.82 (CI, 0.72; 0.94)) as compared to homozygosity of the C allele. None of the SNPs examined were significantly associated with FEV1. However, two SNPs (rs10399931 and rs4950930) appeared to be significantly associated with FEV(1)/FVC-ratio. Subgroup analyses of never-smokers did not consistently influence the associations in an either positively og negatively way.
To determine the impact of CTCF binding on MYC expression, a series of mutant human chromosomal alleles was prepared in homologous recombination-efficient DT40 cells and individually transferred by microcell fusion into murine cells. Functional tests reported here reveal that deletion of CTCF binding elements within the MINE does not impact the capacity of this locus to correctly organize an 'accessible' open chromatin domain, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the formation of a competent, transcriptionally active locus. Moreover, deletion of the CTCF site at the MYC P2 promoter reduces transcription but does not affect promoter acetylation or serum-inducible transcription. Importantly, removal of either CTCF site leads to DNA methylation of flanking sequences, thereby contributing to progressive loss of transcriptional activity.
The present study investigated if low antioxidant activity in islets is already observed at birth and if maternal protein restriction influences the development of islet antioxidant defenses. Rats were fed a control diet (C group) or a low protein diet during gestation (LP) or until weaning (LPT), after which offspring received the control diet. We found that antioxidant enzymatic activities varied with age. At birth and after weaning, normal islets possessed an efficient GPX activity. However, the antioxidant capacity decreased thereafter increasing the potential vulnerability to oxidative stress. Maternal protein malnutrition changed the antioxidant enzymatic activities in islets of the progeny. At 3 months, SOD activity was increased in LP and LPT islets with no concomitant activation of CAT and GPX. This unbalance could lead to higher hydrogen peroxide production, which may concur to oxidative stress causing defective insulin gene expression due to modification of critical factors that modulate the insulin promoter. We found indeed that insulin mRNA level was reduced in both groups of malnourished offspring compared to controls. Analyzing the expression of such critical factors, we found that c-Myc expression was strongly increased in islets from both protein-restricted groups compared to controls.
Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing pioglitazone in combination with any insulin-containing regimen in comparison with the same insulin regimen alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Outcomes investigated included HbA1c, hypoglycaemia, weight, and adverse events. Studies were selected, assessed and summarised according to standard systematic review methodology and in a meta-analysis. We included eight trials that examined the benefits of adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen and studied a total of 3092 patients with type 2 diabetes. All studies included patients with previously inadequate glucose control. Trial duration was between 12 weeks and 34.5 months. The trials used pioglitazone doses of up to 45 mg/day. In our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 0.58% (95% CI: -0.70, -0.46, p&lt;0.00001). Hypoglycaemic episodes were slightly more frequent in the pioglitazone arms (relative risk 1.27; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.63, p = 0.06). Where reported, HDL-cholesterol tended to be increased with pioglitazone. Patients on pioglitazone tended to gain more weight than those who were not, with an average difference of almost 3 kg. Peripheral oedema was more frequent in the pioglitazone groups. None of the studies reported on fractures in women, and data on cardiovascular events were inconclusive, with most studies being too short or too small to assess these long-term outcomes.
We have discovered that GBS significantly remodels its transcriptome in response to exposure to human amniotic fluid. GBS grew rapidly in human AF and did not exhibit a global stress response. The majority of changes in GBS transcripts in AF compared to THY medium were related to genes mediating metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. The majority of the observed changes in transcripts affects genes involved in basic bacterial metabolism and is connected to AF composition and nutritional requirements of the bacterium. Importantly, the response to growth in human AF included significant changes in transcripts of multiple virulence genes such as adhesins, capsule, and hemolysin and IL-8 proteinase what might have consequences for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions.
[corrected] We isolated normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and co-infected them with HIV-1 and with either the well characterized CDC1551 or HN878 MTb clinical isolate. We show that HIV-1 co-infection with the CDC1551 MTb strain results in higher levels of virus replication relative to co-infection with the HN878 MTb strain ex vivo. Furthermore, we show that the distinct pattern of CDC1551 or HN878 induced HIV-1 replication is associated with significantly increased levels of TNF and IL-6, and of the transcription and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, by CDC1551 relative to HN878.
Patients with ILI (fever &gt; or =38 degrees C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient. During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations. At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region. Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%). Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study.
To explore the role of miRNAs in schizophrenia, 59 microRNA genes on the X-chromosome were amplified and sequenced in males with (193) and without (191) schizophrenia spectrum disorders to test the hypothesis that ultra-rare mutations in microRNA collectively contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. Here we provide the first association of microRNA gene dysfunction with schizophrenia. Eight ultra-rare variants in the precursor or mature miRNA were identified in eight distinct miRNA genes in 4% of analyzed males with schizophrenia. One ultra-rare variant was identified in a control sample (with a history of depression) (8/193 versus 1/191, p = 0.02 by one-sided Fisher's exact test, odds ratio = 8.2). These variants were not found in an additional 7,197 control X-chromosomes.
While preparations of DHPG from three companies suppressed GABAergic transmission in an mGluR-dependent way, one batch had an additional, unusual effect. Even in the presence of antagonists of mGluRs, it caused a reversible, profound suppression of inhibitory transmission. This mGluR-independent action was not due to a higher potency of the compound, or its ability to cause endocannabinoid-dependent responses. Field potential recordings revealed that glutamatergic transmission was not affected, and quantal analysis of GABA transmission confirmed the unusual effect was on GABA release, and not GABA(A) receptors. We have not identified the responsible factor in the DHPG preparation, but the samples were 99% pure as determined by HPLC and NMR analyses.
A considerable number of patients (11% of our cohort) had potential vitamin-medication interactions in the preceding 3 months, which could theoretically result in adverse events, and over one-third of these children had more than one potential interaction. Patients with potential interactions and their parents were significantly older (p &lt; 0.001 for the child and mother, p = 0.02 for the father), the children were much more likely to have a chronic illness (p &lt; 0.001) and concurrently receive prescribed or over-the-counter medication (p &lt; 0.001), and more children with potential interactions were completely immunized (p = 0.02). The child's sex, parental education, employment status, family income, and primary language spoken at home were not associated with potential interactions.
Eighty-three (10 female, 73 male) cases were reviewed. Mean age = 33.3 years (range 1-78). Mean ISS = 19.4, GCS = 12.5. Five (6.0%) had amputations; 7 (8.4%) died. Fractures occurred in 68.7% (n = 57), and vascular injuries were present in 38.6% (n = 32). In 7 patients (8.4%), a delayed compartment release resulted in muscle necrosis requiring multiple debridements, subsequent wound closure problems, and long term disability. Of note, none of these patients had prior compartment pressure measurements. Furthermore, 6 patients (7%) had superficial peroneal nerve transections as complications of their fasciotomy.
All three patients presented recurrences within 3 years after resection, i.e., disseminated peritoneal recurrence in two patients and local recurrence in one. The two patients with peritoneal recurrences were treated by surgical resection and chemotherapy. The patient with local recurrence could not be treated due to contraindicating local factors. All three patients were alive at the time of this writing.
Epidural placement was achieved easily in all cases, with high quality analgesia for 24-96 h. Tracheal extubation was delayed after 4 anaesthetics due to muscle relaxant overdose (n = 1), surgeon's request (n = 2), and systemic opioid administration before epidural anaesthesia was considered (n = 1). Intraoperative complications included haemodynamic instability (n = 1) and vascular catheter placement (n = 5). Postoperative complications included meningitis (n = 1), insertion site erythema (n = 7), apnoea (n = 6; 4 premature and 2 full-term infants) and tracheal re-intubation (n = 6).
Median age at the time of surgery was 5 months in group A compared to 23 months in group B. Only in 21.4% of the children with CV compared to 60.7% without CV hydronephrosis was diagnosed by ultrasound examination antenatally. We found a preoperative DRF of 42.4% +/- 11.2 SD in group A, and of 38.9% +/- 11.7 SD in group B. The percentage of postoperative improvement was 3.3% in group A and 15.4% in group B.
Twelve newborns with colonic atresia were identified. Two babies were managed initially with ostomy, both of whom had gastroschisis; primary repair was performed on ten, with two undergoing simultaneous rectal biopsy. No anastomotic complications occurred and there were no mortalities. One patient experienced self-limited malabsorption symptoms after repair. No cases of Hirschsprung's disease were detected.
There were no complications during surgical procedure and after 48 h, with easy respiratory weaning after 24 h. Hospital discharge ranged from 5 to 10 days. Long-term follow-up (range 18 months-5 years) demonstrated no evidence of recurrences.
The earlier period (1998-2000) was characterized by a significantly higher rate of operations compared with the later period (2001-2004) (P = 0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (P = 0.04). Injury severity scores, type of organs injured, and accompanying injuries were similarly distributed in the two groups.
The mean operative time was 147 min. 2-cm incision was extended in one patient with malrotated kidney. There was improvement in function in 37 (95%) with no failure. The mean split renal function, preoperative and at follow-up were 35.7 and 44.2%, respectively (P = 0.000). The mean glomerular filtration rate (ml/min), preoperative and at follow-up were 27.4 and 39.1%, respectively (P = 0.000). Mean follow-up period was 24 months.
All pts had difficulty in voiding and eight had recurrent urinary tract infection. Renal function was normal in all pts. VCUG showed filling of Cowper's duct in a pt. In a case, a vesicoureteral reflux was discovered. Uroflowmetry showed a flat trace in all cases. Transurethral endoscopic resection of the valves was carried out in 11 children while open resection was necessary in two children. At serial follow-up, all pts remain symptom-free and uroflowmetry documented regular pattern.
Mean age of presentation was 6.8 years (range 2-12 years). Seven patients were males, while one patient was female. Seven patients had a history of blunt trauma abdomen some time back. Only one patient had acute presentation with respiratory distress following road traffic accident, rest of the patients had no associated grievous injury at the time of presentation. One patient presented with features of acute obstruction. All patients could be diagnosed preoperatively and surgical intervention was performed in all cases. The patients recovered well and there was no mortality.
Ninety-five CVCs were positioned in 84 children. The overall length of observation ranged between 41 and 482 days for a total of 18,618 catheter days. Mechanical complications occurred in 5% of the devices (specific rate 0.27); infections were observed in 6% of the devices (specific rate 0.32). No complications were observed during the first 30 days after CVC insertion.
There was no significant difference in the pattern of innervation circumferentially. There was a correlation between a progressive increase of AChE activity and nerve hypertrophy and a decrease of ganglion cells from the proximal to the distal part of the resected colon in the submucosa and the myenteric plexus. Nerve hypertrophy and AChE-positive reaction in the mucosa were found at the resection border in patients who presented postoperative complications.
In the DH group, the lungs were hypoplastic with a decrease in the total lung weight to body weight ratio, and remarkable thickening in alveolar septa. The lung vessels showed significantly thicker arterial walls when compared with those from control fetuses. The pathological finding in the CGS group was similar to that of the DH group. The thickness of the alveolar septa and of the pulmonary arterial walls showed no significant difference among the GS group, DH group and the CGS group. The ratio of liver weight to body weight increased notably in the GS group, DH group and CGS group compared with that in the CR group.
A sense of insight was developed, and participants felt they could empathize with this type of suffering. The ability to change attitudes to focus on the development of therapeutic relationships was enhanced.
The fall rate in this study was 1.2% of all inpatients. Nearly all (89.7%) falls occurred when patients attempted to stand up, get out of bed, or walk.
Participants recognized a need for on-ward and problem-based education and infrastructural and managerial support. The declared high ethical principles were not in accordance with the participants' reliance on manpower and the high seclusion and restraint rates.
The findings of this study indicate that psychiatric crisis and triage clinicians hold negative attitudes toward those with a diagnosis of personality disorder.
For the PHQ-9, a cutoff score equal to or higher than 10 proved to be the most adequate for the screening of depression, whereas the best cutoff score for the PHQ-2 was found to lie between 3 and 4.
Muscle activation and co-contraction levels were significantly higher on virtually all outcome measures for the paretic and nonparetic arms of the participants with stroke than for the matched control participants. Only the nonparetic shoulder responded to load type with similar activation levels but variable co-contraction responses relative to those of the control shoulder. Elastic and viscous loads were associated with strong activation; mass and viscous loads were associated with minimal co-contraction.
Scores on the ST (performed with the nonparetic leg as the stepping leg) and UMCe were positively correlated with peak vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) beneath the paretic limb during functional tasks (R(2)=.35-.76 for the ST, pseudo R(2)=.21-.34 for the UMCe). Scores on the RR were positively correlated with change in vertical GRF beneath the paretic limb during the diagonal reach task (R(2)=.45) and with weight-transfer time during stepping with the nonparetic limb (R(2)=.15).
There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the primary or secondary outcome measures at 2 weeks or 4 weeks. The effect size between groups for each of the primary outcomes was small (NDI=1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-6.8 to 3.8; PSFS=0.29, 95% CI=-1.8 to 1.2; and NPRS=0.52, 95% CI=-1.8 to 1.2).
There were discrepancies between the clinical and the neurophysiological measures of spasticity. The clinical measure of spasticity was not effective in consistently identifying the presence of spasticity and, therefore, also was ineffective in documenting the individuals' responses to treatment. The neurophysiological measure was able to identify when muscle activity levels had been reduced, but a reduction in muscle activity levels did not always correspond with a reduction in Modified Ashworth Scale scores.
For the 70 study participants (42 women and 28 men; mean [SD] age=54.1 years [9.0]; mean [SD] VAS score at baseline=6.4 [1.7]), there were no between-group differences at baseline in VAS, CMS, and SST scores. At the end of the 2-week intervention, participants in the HILT group showed a significantly greater decrease in pain than participants in the US therapy group. Statistically significant differences in change in pain, articular movement, functionality, and muscle strength (force-generating capacity) (VAS, CMS, and SST scores) were observed after 10 treatment sessions from the baseline for participants in the HILT group compared with participants in the US therapy group. In particular, only the difference in change of VAS score between groups (1.65 points) surpassed the accepted minimal clinically important difference for this tool.
The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children did show improvement during supramaximal testing.
The described system uses overhead infrared heaters that are relatively inexpensive and are accurate and precise in rapidly controlling the temperature. Remote computer-based data acquisition and control via the internet provides the ability to use complex temperature regimes and real-time monitoring. Due to its easy mobility, the heating system can randomly be allotted in the open field or in the greenhouse within the experimental setup. The apparatus has been successfully applied to study the response of rice to high night temperatures. Air temperatures were maintained within the set points +/- 0.5 degrees C. The incorporation of the combination of air-situated thermocouples, autotuned proportional integrative derivative temperature controllers and phase angled fired silicon controlled rectifier power controllers provides very fast proportional heating action (i.e. 9 ms time base), which avoids prolonged or intense heating of the plant material.
Real-time imaging of acoustic field distribution obtained by the Schlieren system, as well as real-time ultrasound visualization, produced stable cavitation both in water and in the gel phantoms. The area where the effect was visible corresponded to the focal area of energy delivered by the system transducer, as measured by the hydrophone. Histologically stained specimens of skin and subcutaneous fat that were excised from porcine studies (n = 14) following treatments (n = 31) demonstrated fat cell lysis and no observable cellular destruction of adjacent blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. No epidermal or dermal changes were observed clinically or histologically.
Mean follow-up time after reconstruction was 6.5 years (range, 1 to 18 years). Procedure type had no effect on short-term aesthetic satisfaction. However, in the long term, reconstruction type considerably affected satisfaction. Although satisfaction with TRAM reconstruction remained relatively constant, satisfaction with expander/implants was significantly less among those patients in the long term. Patients who had undergone implant reconstruction more than 8 years earlier, compared with those who undergone implant reconstruction less than 5 years earlier, were significantly less satisfied with breast appearance (odds ratio, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.48), softness (odds ratio, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.64), and size (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.62).
Typical mammographic findings, including architectural distortion, cysts, and calcifications, were similar between the two groups. There was no significant difference in breast density scores. The oncoplastic reduction group had longer times to mammographic stabilization (21.2 versus 25.6 months, p = 0.23). There was a trend toward a greater number of postoperative mammograms and ultrasounds in the study group when indexed per follow-up year. The rate of tissue sampling in the study group was significantly higher (53 percent) than that in the control group (18 percent).
No significant differences in the proliferative capacity (n = 3), alkaline phosphatase staining (n = 3), or extracellular matrix mineralization (n = 3) of suction-assisted lipoaspiration- or third-generation ultrasound-assisted lipoaspiration-derived cells were appreciated. Transcript levels of markers of early and terminal osteogenic differentiation were not significantly different (n = 3).
Volumetric analysis at the 8-week time point showed 82 percent persistence of the original volume. Gross analysis showed it to be healthy, nonfibrotic, and vascularized. Hematoxylin and eosin analysis showed minimal inflammatory or capsular reaction, with viable adipocytes. Fat grafted areas were vascularized with multiple blood vessels. Cytochrome c oxidase IV human-specific stain and beta-galactosidase expression revealed these vessels to be of human origin.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of control specimens revealed the presence of a distinct layer of wavy, parallel arrays of collagen fibers consistent with capsule formation. Immunostaining identified abundant myofibroblasts, a profibrotic cell found in breast capsules. In the AlloDerm-covered specimens, no capsule layer was visible, and specimens stained weakly for myofibroblasts. The difference in myofibroblast staining intensity was statistically significant.
Cyclical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in expression of neuropeptides and growth factors, whereas the corresponding peptide receptors were down-regulated. Transcription of neuropeptide mRNA was elevated in stretched skin, which proves that neuropeptides are released from not only peripheral terminals of nerve fibers but also resident skin cells.
Head and neck oncologic patients underwent tumor resection followed by immediate reconstruction using a supraclavicular artery island flap. Ablative defects included neck, tracheal-stomal, mandible, parotid, and pharyngeal walls. All flaps (n = 18) were harvested in less than 1 hour. All ablative wounds and donor sites were closed primarily and did not require additional surgery. Major complications included a complete flap loss when the vascular pedicle was inadvertently divided and pharyngeal leaks. The leaks resolved without surgical intervention, and both patients regained the ability to swallow using their neo-esophagus. Minor complications included donor-site wound dehiscence and cellulitis. None of the patients reported functional donor-site morbidity.
Among the 33 patients included in the study, there was an average reinnervation time of 8.9 months. According to Terzis and Noah's classification system, 12 patients (36.3 percent) were considered grade V, 12 (36.3 percent) were grade IV, four (12.2 percent) were grade III, two (6.1 percent) were grade II, and three (9.1 percent) were grade I.
Thirty patients, nine boys and 21 girls, were operated on, with an average age of 11 years (range, 4 to 17 years). A total of 43 procedures were performed: 27 liposuctions, 10 lipoinjections, and six combined procedures. Average hospital stay was 1.1 days. Of a total 20 patients who underwent liposuction, six required revision. Histopathologic study showed 19 lipomatoses and one lipoblastomatosis. Cosmetic outcomes based on Strasser scale were as follows: six excellent, 19 good, four mediocre, and one poor.
At the time of hemipelvectomy, a musculocutaneous hemipelvectomy flap was sufficient for closure in 159 patients, one patient needed a free lower leg fillet flap, and none required pedicle flaps. No hemipelvectomy hernias were observed, although abdominal wall reconstruction was performed in three patients. Wound complications were encountered in 62 patients (39 percent), and 51 patients required operative débridement. Thirty-three patients healed by secondary intention, and 25 underwent delayed reconstruction with local tissue rearrangements (n = 15), split-thickness skin grafting (n = 6), and pedicled flaps (n = 6). All pedicled flaps were contralateral inferiorly based rectus abdominis muscle (n = 2) and musculocutaneous (n = 4) flaps.
Eleven patients (22 incisions) were enrolled in the study. The dermal stapler was four times faster than standard suture closure, reducing closure time by 10.5 minutes (p &lt;or= 0.001). Overall cost savings with the dermal stapler was $220 per case. In the early postoperative period, the dermal stapler had a higher Vancouver Scar Scale score than sutures because of superior wound eversion, a beneficial characteristic for wound healing. By 4 months postoperatively, no significant difference in scar scores was found between interventions. At 6 months, histologic analysis suggested decreased inflammatory cell invasion of the dermal stapler-closed scar.
All flaps except one survived. The overall flap survival rate was 97 percent. Patients achieved satisfactory results without major postoperative complications. The study revealed that vascularized fascia may mimic a fascial sheath but lacks the muscle-synchronized excursion properties. Apart from a mild deficiency in quadriceps femoris muscles contraction in the donor thighs, no difficulties in daily ambulation were reported by the patients.
Forty-five thighs were included in this study. All perforators emerged from the ascending branch of the lateral circumflex artery. The average number of musculocutaneous perforators was 2.3 (range, 0 to 5), the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine was 10.9 cm (range, 4.5 to 16.1 cm), and the diameter was 0.9 mm (range, 0.2 to 2 mm). Four specimens had no musculocutaneous perforator. The average number of septocutaneous perforators was 1.8 (range, 1 to 3), the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine was 10.9 cm (range, 6.2 to 15.7 cm), and the diameter was 1.5 mm (range, 0.5 to 3 mm). Seventy-six percent of the septocutaneous perforators emerged between 8 and 12 cm from the anterior superior iliac spine. The possible pedicle length of a flap based on these vessels is 8.1 cm (range, 6.5 to 10 cm). In the injection study, the average skin area stained with methylene blue was 19.4 x 13.4 cm (range, 10 to 24 cm x 7 to 17 cm) in the ascending branch group. In the perforator group, the average skin area was 19.2 x 13.7 cm (range, 15 to 22 cm x 12 to 16 cm).
Sixteen of 19 patients (84 percent) reported pain reduction at rest. Thirteen patients reported immediate relief; three reported more gradual pain reduction over 1 to 2 months. Three patients had no or minimal pain relief. Tissue perfusion results demonstrated a marked change in blood flow (-48.15 percent to 425 percent) to the digits. All patients with chronic finger ulcers healed within 60 days. Most patients [n = 12 (63 percent)] remained pain-free (13 to 59 months) with a single-injection schedule. Four patients (21 percent) required repeated injections because of recurrent pain.
Results were assessed according to range of joint motion (Kleinert and Verdan criteria) and electromyographic and radiologic studies. Ninety-four percent had excellent results and 6 percent of digits had good results. There were no patients with fair or poor results. Average active range of motion was 244 degrees at 18 months. No gapping or ruptures occurred and no tenolyses were required. The control group of matched controls (modified Kessler repair; no botulinum injection) showed that 81 percent of digits had excellent results, 6 percent had good results, 8 percent had fair results, and 6 percent had poor results.
Two patients underwent excision of the thrombosed segment and direct ulnar artery repair. All reconstructions were performed using vein grafts. Eight reconstructions remained patent at a mean 52 months postoperatively. All patients had a mean improvement in digital brachial index (0.82 versus 0.70), decrease in pain and dysesthesia symptoms, and decrease in cold intolerance compared with preoperatively. Patients with ulnar artery occlusion at final measurement had more improvement in digital brachial index (0.19 versus 0.03) and tended to have better subjective improvement in symptoms and function than those whose ulnar artery remained patent.
The complication rate in 420 cases was low and decreased with experience. Complications included hematoma (n = 5), temporary facial paresis (n = 4), submental lipolysis (n = 3), skin perforation (n = 1), minor skin burn (n = 1), skin necrosis (n = 0), and hair loss (n = 0). Mean operative time for face lift with a superficial musculoaponeurotic system procedure and anterior platysmaplasty was 180 minutes (range, 140 to 210 minutes). Drainage at day 1 was 20 cc (range, 0 to 30 cc). Average return to normal social life was by day 8 (range, 5 to 20 days). Results at day 8 were graded 1 for edema and ecchymosis.
Ninety-seven patients and 24 clinicians were interviewed. Patients were dissatisfied with scars resulting from surgery, irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity, or geographical location, and 91 percent would value even small improvements in scarring. Patients had scar(s) that they wished were less noticeable over a wide range of body sites (both "visible" and "nonvisible"). Male and female respondents had similar rates of dissatisfaction about their own scars. The survey revealed issues in the communication between patients and clinicians regarding scars; 71 percent of patients felt that they were more concerned than their surgeon about the scar resulting from a recent surgical procedure.
Fat was noted deep to the orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles. This fat is distinct from the more superficial fat of the cutaneous lip. The wet-dry border of the lip appears to be the most anterior boundary of the submuscular lip fat. The lateral boundary is the zygomaticus muscle. Histologic examination confirms this macroscopic anatomy.
Nine fractional lasers were evaluated. Main differences in outcome were related to type of laser wavelength. In general, scanning technologies are faster and more precise. Deeper injuries result in more collagen remodeling. Variations in laser wavelengths, depth of injury, type of delivery system, consumables, and architecture of the fractionated laser light are important considerations when evaluating fractional lasers. Little scientific research comparing the injury, healing, and outcomes of the various fractional lasers is available.
Seventy-five relevant articles were included in the final analysis, three of which were review articles. The most commonly measured outcome was healing rate (64 of 72), followed by pain (58 of 72), infection rate (40 of 72), healing quality (40 of 72), and cost (15 of 72). No studies measured quality of life. The majority of articles were randomized controlled trials (35 of 75), followed by observational studies (22 of 75), unsystematic clinical observations (15 of 75), and review articles (three of 75). It was difficult to compare moist and nonmoist dressings in this review because of the methodological heterogeneity of the included articles. The available evidence suggests, however, that moist dressings are superior in terms of pain.
The authors' comprehensive management of vascular anomalies as described in this article has resulted in high patient satisfaction and an excellent outcome in a majority of patients.
The use of different therapy modalities, such as the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, pulsed dye laser, erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, and intense pulsed light systems, is discussed. Outcomes, risks, benefits, and treatment protocols vary for each entity and for each laser. The authors' results and those of others are presented.
The need for late reconstruction in pediatric burn survivors is significantly influenced by the acute surgical and rehabilitative treatments. With their vulnerability to airway swelling, hypothermia, pulmonary edema, and ischemia-reperfusion injury, pediatric patients with large burns require precise, life-saving treatment in the acute phase. Decision-making in pediatric burn reconstruction must take into account the patient's future growth, maturity, and often lack of suitable donor sites.
Out of a total of 184 Worcestershire general dental practitioners, 161 (87.5%) submitted usable responses. The audit revealed wide variation between dentists in clinical record-keeping. The recording of soft tissues (36% below grade 2), periodontal status (30%), radiographic review (27%), and note-taking (25%) all fell below the standard that had been set (brackets show proportion not meeting the standard).
One hundred subjects were recruited to the study. The mean score for the OHIP-14 was 21.8 (SD 17.0). The most commonly reported impacts experienced were problems with toothache, discomfort, ability to relax, and feeling ashamed regarding the appearance of teeth. Of the different categories of homeless people, rough sleepers experienced higher levels of impact (P=0.004). Those having more than 20 teeth were more likely to experience lower levels of impact (P=0.001).
Fifty subjects (24.1%) from English schools and 52 subjects (25.5%) from Australian schools reported injury/injuries to the head, face and teeth. Australian cricketers reported more injuries per player. The distribution of injuries between the two countries was similar. Sixteen players had sustained loosened or broken teeth. Two players reported avulsed teeth.
A 71% response rate was achieved. The results reflected changes in opinion about the dental profession among VDPs between when they applied for university and six years later on their completion of VT. During this period, they reported that their feelings of job security had declined from 93.1% (n=390) to 34.1% (n=145) and financial security from 94.8% (n=405) to 51.5% (n=219). Anxiety about the potential lack of funding in the NHS was felt by 77.6% (n=330). The effect of increasing numbers of dental graduates on employment prospects produced anxiety in 72.5% (n=305) of VDPs. On completion of VT, 19.4% (n=83) of VDPs did not have employment for the following year.
These indicated that both materials increased in hardness and underwent colour change after accelerated ageing. The initial hardness of Trusoft was far lower than that of Ufi Gel P (18.2 Shore A units vs 34.8 Shore A units). However, for Trusoft the changes for both hardness (from 18.2 to 52.1 Shore A units) and colour change (16.85 on the CIE L*a*b* colour scale) were greater than those for Ufi Gel P, for which hardness changed from 34.8 to 36.5 Shore A units and the colour change was 5.19 on the CIE L*a*b* colour scale.
A significant time per genotype interaction was found between rs4305746 in repeated measures of ANOVA on BPRS scores (F=2.45, df=10,365, p=0.008). In particular G/A and A/A genotype patients were more likely to improve over time as compared to carriers of the G/G genotype. Permutation analysis confirmed a significant effect of rs4305746 on course of BPRS scores over time (p=0.007). Haplotype analysis did not reveal any significant association with clinical and safety scores at any time.
Costs incurred by patients who ever relapsed ( pound14,055) during three years were almost double to those incurred by patients who never relapsed ( pound7417). 61% of the cost difference was accounted for by hospital stay. The impact of relapse was even greater in the 1-year cost comparison. Results from the additional analysis with imputed missing data remained largely consistent.
We detected a significant association between ESR1 and methamphetamine induced psychosis patients in allele/genotype-wise analysis. For further interpretation of these associations, we performed single marker analysis of subjects divided by sex. Rs2234693 was associated with male methamphetamine induced psychosis.
We found an association between rs6465084 in GRM3 and MDD in the allele-wise analysis after Bonferroni's correction (P-value=0.0371). However, we did not find any association between GRM3 and BP or the fluvoxamine therapeutic response in MDD in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. We also did not detect any association between GRM2 and MDD, BP or the fluvoxamine therapeutic response in MDD in the allele/genotype-wise or haplotype-wise analysis.
Amygdala volumes in both hemispheres were significantly smaller in patients with panic disorder compared with control subjects (left: t = -2.248, d.f. = 55, P = 0.029; right: t = -2.892, d.f. = 55, P = 0.005). VBM showed that structural alteration in the panic disorder group occurred on the corticomedial nuclear group within the right amygdala (coordinates [x,y,z (mm)]: [26,-6,-16], Z score = 3.92, family-wise error-corrected P = 0.002). The state anxiety was negatively correlated with the left amygdala volume in patients with panic disorder (r = -0.545, P = 0.016).
The mean total score of the SRDL scale was positively correlated with both the WHO-QOL-26 and VAS, while the SRDL scale was negatively correlated with the BPRS total score.
Logistic regression showed that subjects with the eveningness chronotype had a higher chance of reporting more severe depressive symptoms compared to morning- and intermediate-chronotypes, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.83 and 5.01, respectively. Other independent cofactors associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms were female gender (OR, 3.36), minor psychiatric disorders (OR, 3.70) and low future self-perception (OR, 3.11). Younger age, however, was associated with a lower level of depressive symptoms (OR, 0.97). The questions in the MADRS that presented higher discriminate coefficients among chronotypes were those related to sadness, inner tension, sleep reduction and pessimism.
Factor analysis in the university students indicated that the BCIS-J was composed of two factors, self-reflectiveness and self-certainty, as was seen in the original BCIS. The relation between the specific dimensions of clinical insight and each component of the BCIS-J in patients with schizophrenia indicated that overconfidence in their belief or judgment may be involved in their attitude to treatment and openness to feedback, and objectivity might be essential to attribute one's symptoms as part of mental illness.
The results included the following findings: (i) the level of plasma SP in the PSD group (58.47 +/- 14.39) was higher than that of the PS group (36.98 +/- 9.49; P = 0.000), while the level of CSF SP in the PSD group (72.13 +/- 13.06) was higher than that of the post-stroke group (37.30 +/- 12.57; P = 0.03); (ii) the level of plasma SP was positively correlated with the HAMD and NIHSS score; (iii) the level of plasma SP (38.45 +/- 12.23), the HAMD score (9.08 +/- 8.72), and the NIHSS score (3.25 +/- 1.90) of the anterior stroke group (51.21 +/- 16.27, 17.46 +/- 15.96, and 6.91 +/- 3.30, respectively) were higher than those of the posterior stroke group (38.45 +/- 12.23, 9.08 +/- 8.7, and 3.25 +/- 1.90, respectively; P = 0.017, P = 0.001, and P = 0.000, respectively).
In the whole sample, particularly in pre-menopausal women, levels of thyroid stimulating hormone-potential markers of subclinical hypothyroidism were correlated with those of less severe but more resistant depressive form. Conversely, total thyroxine levels were correlated with a more severe depression, but high levels of this hormone favored the response to antidepressants. Overall, a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with a poor response to antidepressant treatment. Finally, total triiodothyronine levels were associated with better cognitive functioning, though they did not influence improvement occurring with recovery.
Cronbach's alpha and split-half reliability were 0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The J-CDS score in the depersonalization group was significantly higher than in the healthy control group. The J-CDS score was significantly correlated with scores of total DES, and DES-depersonalization. The best compromise between the true positive and false negative rate was at a cut-off point of 60, yielding a sensitivity of 1.00 and a specificity of 0.96.
Significant reductions in the PANSS total and subscale scores were observed in both the perospirone and risperidone groups, with no significant between-group differences at 4 and 12 weeks. Risperidone improved the total scores and overall psychopathologic symptom total scores more effectively than perospirone at week 8. There were no significant differences in the DIEPSS scores at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks between the perospirone and risperidone groups. The numbers of patients who dropped out did not differ between the perospirone and risperidone groups.
The total number of patients admitted to psychiatric beds in general hospitals for the above-mentioned reason was 326, while the number of patients who could not be admitted to them despite the same reason was 88. The rate of surgical diseases in the latter group was higher than that in the former group. In the latter group, diseases requiring orthopedic surgery (22%) and abdominal surgery (22%) were the most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases (8%), and gynecological diseases (7%). Patients who had attempted suicide were included more in the latter group than in the former group. Even in the former group, general hospitals could not respond to 34% of requests for emergency admission.
All the groups were affected by the situational shift, the average activity level of each the groups was higher and the standard deviation was smaller than those during the in-seat classes. The boys with ADHD exhibited a still smaller standard deviation than the controls and the boys with PDD and hyperactivity during the free recess period; no difference between the controls and the boys with PDD was seen. The boys with PDD exhibited a significantly lower average activity level than the other groups. No differences among the groups in the average activity levels and standard deviation were seen during the in-seat classes.
After controlling for potential confounding factors using multiple logistic regression, the judgments showed significant relationships with BPRS-P, SANS, GAS, and age. Patient attitudes showed significant relationships with the length of the current hospital stay, SANS, and psychiatrists' judgments.
Comparison of baseline values indicated that there were no significant differences in any of the metabolite ratios (N-acetyl aspartate/creatine [NAA/Cr], myoinositol [Ino]/Cr, and choline [Cho]/Cr) between patients and controls. Significant differences were detected between pre- and post-treatment Ino/Cr ratios (0.67 +/- 0.13, 0.58 +/- 0.22, P = 0.032, respectively), although there was no difference in NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios.
Depression and low family monitoring were the discriminative factors for Internet addiction in all four gender- and age-specified groups of adolescents. Low connectedness to school, high family conflict, having friends with habitual alcohol drinking, and living in rural areas also had discriminative effects on adolescent Internet addiction in adolescents of different gender and age.
Of the 70 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, 33 patients were diagnosed as having comorbid psychiatric disorders including 18 major depressive disorders. Sixteen patients with psychiatric disorders and eight patients with major depressive disorders did not fulfill the criteria of any psychiatric disorders at the follow up. As for chronic fatigue syndrome, nine out of the 70 patients had recovered at the follow up. There is no significant influence of comorbid psychiatric disorders on the outcome of chronic fatigue syndrome.
While the total QOL-AD score based on the patients' responses did not change significantly, the total QOL-AD score derived from the caregivers' responses declined. Both the Activities-of-Daily-Living score and the mood factor of the NPI score predicted the change in the QOL-AD score as assessed by the caregivers' responses. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the changes in two factors of the NPI, i.e. the mood and psychosis factor, and the changes in the QOL-AD score based on the caregivers' responses.
Of the 32 mood disorder patients who met the subject conditions, 59.4% had OSAS. The diagnosis rate with our criteria was significantly higher than the previously reported incidence of OSAS in patients with depression. There was no significant difference among diagnosis rates as to individual risk factors or the number of risk factors. A multiple regression test showed no significant association between apnea-hypopnea index and other clinical factors including depression severity.
Only 20.8% of the participants did not have a comorbidity of any kind, while psychiatric comorbidities (67.7%) were more frequent than medical comorbidities (39.6%). Education and severity of depressive symptoms negatively influenced cognitive performance. Psychiatric comorbidity alone significantly decreased cognitive performance in the visuospatial/constructional and the language domains and the total score. In addition, increasing numbers of psychiatric comorbidities were related to worse cognitive performance. In contrast, medical illnesses alone had no negative impact on any of the domains of cognitive performance. Evidence was found for additive effects of medical and psychiatric comorbidities in depression on visuospatial/constructional cognitive abilities.
An average total of 1,031,557 patients with mood and anxiety disorders were enrolled as study participants, including 76,430 cases of major depressive disorder, 41,557 cases of bipolar disorder, and 913,570 cases of anxiety disorder. When compared with the insured population without mood or anxiety disorders (average 21,356,304 people), the average relative risk (RR) of developing ischemic heart disease and hypertensive disorders in 1,031,557 study participants was 2.0 and 2.05, respectively. The highest RR was found in the age group under 20 years (RR = 4.74 and 4.08, respectively), and the lowest RR in the age group equal to or older than 65 years (RR = 0.47 and 0.58, respectively).
The prevalence of self-harm using sharp object was 5.4% among male 5th-6th graders, 4.0% among female 5th-6th graders, 5.3% among male 7th-9th graders, 15.1% among female 7th-9th graders, 6.6% among male 10th-12th graders, and 9.6% among female 10th-12th graders. Categorical regression analysis showed that a small amount of variance in self-harm by sharp object was explained by DSRSC and A-DES scores.
Genotypic distribution of the NPY1R gene showed a significant association with methamphetamine dependence and psychosis (P = 0.04), whereas the NPY gene had no significant association with them.
Neuropsychiatric problems are more prevalent and longer-lasting in TBI patients than in the general population. About 40% of TBI victims suffer from two or more psychiatric disorders, and a similar percentage experience at least one unmet need for cognitive, emotional, or job assistance 1 year after injury. The entire spectrum of TBI severity, from mild to severe, is associated with an increase in psychiatric conditions.
The incidence of delirium for patients receiving dexmedetomidine was 3%, for those receiving propofol was 50%, and for patients receiving midazolam, 50%. Patients who developed postoperative delirium experienced significantly longer intensive-care stays and longer total hospitalization.
Falls in the general hospital were associated with delirium (both diagnosed and undiagnosed), advanced age, and specific surgical procedures.
The incidence of major depression was 63% in usual-care patients and 36% in the intervention group. Effects of intervention on depressive symptoms were observed in outpatients with diabetes but not in rheumatology inpatients.
Of 542 patients enrolled, 192 (35.4%) developed delirium. After 3 months, mortality in the delirium cohort was 25.9%, and in the nondelirium cohort was 5.8%. Delirium was independently associated with mortality, and increased by 11% for every 48 hours of delirium.
Three distinct depressive syndromes were identified: The first corresponds to DSM-IV major depression. The second is a syndrome of mood lability with prominent responsiveness to the environment. The third is a syndrome of profound apathy, without other evidence of depression.
Among those with dementia (N=166), the hypoactive/mild class was associated with a higher risk of mortality. Among those without dementia (N=275), greater severity was associated with mortality, regardless of psychomotor features, when compared with the normal/mild class.
Scores ranged from 0 to 7 in 120 patients (74.53%; no delirium), 8 to 13 in 19 (11.80%; subclinical/prodromal delirium), and &gt; or = 14 in 22 (13.66%; delirium). The DSM-IV-TR delirium incidence was 19.87%. The first two rotated factors explained 63.37% of the variance and may correspond to Cognition and Psychosis/Agitation factors. The dimension of motor retardation loaded with cognitive items. Motor agitation and retardation clustered with inattention, which is the cardinal symptom of delirium.
Content analysis demonstrated that this cohort of parents experienced long-term emotional distress and substantive disruption to family and daily life.
Moderate-to-severe pain was reported by 29% of patients; depression, by 21%; with both present in 10.3%. Comorbid pain and depression was associated with anxiety, suicidal or death ideation, functional impairment, interpersonal distress, and physical or sexual abuse.
Women with MRKH had significantly more pathological scores on some of the scales and subscales, such as phobic anxiety and psychoticism (interpersonal alienation), with a similar trend for subscales measuring depression and anxiety.
The condition improved dramatically with integrated psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic intervention.
Symptoms quickly resolved after antipsychotics were discontinued, with continuation of valproate and lorazepam treatment.
After administration of lorazapam, the patient was re-started on clonazepam, after which there was a complete and sustained resolution of catatonic symptoms and autonomic instability.
The symptoms continued after stopping the valacyclovir, but improved with risperidone.
After withdrawal of citalopram and treatment with platelet concentrates and prednisolone, the patient recovered completely.
Family caregiving responsibilities were reported by 12% of participants. Caregivers reported more quality of life problems than noncaregivers, but these effects were largely dependent on the perceived level of caregiving strain. High strain caregivers reported more problems with emotional distress, worse physical functioning, and fewer social contacts than noncaregivers. Conversely, caregivers who reported no strain from caregiving reported better quality of life than noncaregivers. Caregiving strain effects were not due to demographic differences or to more objective indicators of caregiving demand.
Both Mental Component Summary Scores (MCS) and Physical Component Summary Scores (PCS) were shown to have high internal consistency reliability (alpha &gt; .80). PCS showed high test-retest reliability (ICC = .78) while MCS demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC = .60). PCS had high convergent validity for EQ-5D items (except self-care) and physical health status (r &gt; .56). MCS demonstrated moderate convergent validity on EQ-5D and mental health items (r &gt; .38). PCS distinguish between groups with different physical and work limitations. Similarly, MCS distinguished between groups with and without cognitive limitations. The MCS and PCS showed perfect dose response when variations in scores were examined by participant's chronic condition status.
After controlling for demographic and clinical confounders, and scores at inclusion, anhedonic non-Type D patients reported lower mental health status (beta = -.19, P &lt; .004), and more feelings of disability (beta = .10, P = .04), marginally lower physical health status (beta = -.11, P = .07), and equal levels of cardiac symptoms (beta = .04, P = .43), when compared with non-Type D's without anhedonia. Type D patients reported lower levels of impaired mental health status, more cardiac symptoms and feelings of disability (-.31 &lt; beta &lt; .17, all Ps &lt; .05). A trend was shown for physical health status (beta = -.11, P = .09).
Women were more satisfied with their family life, men showed greater satisfaction with their leisure activities. Age-group differences appeared in every life satisfaction domain. Age by gender interaction emerged in the field of satisfaction with health, income, and family life. Anxiety and depressive symptoms contributed significantly to the explained variance of domain-specific life satisfaction.
Both groups had greater impairments across the whole spectrum of mental and physical problems assessed by the SF-36 than age specific normative data for the general population. The results also support our hypothesis that, comparing the people with rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia, we did find that there is a greater discrepancy between the physical scales than there is between the mental/emotional scales of the SF-36.
Of the 49 items of the SS-QOL, 54 concepts were identified. The level of agreement between the health care professionals showed that the kappa coefficients ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Three concepts (5.5%) could not be linked to the ICF and were coded as not covered. Fifty-one were linked to the ICF categories for the following components: 22 (41%)-body functions; 26 (48%)-activities and participation; and three (5.5%)-environmental factors. Eleven ICF chapters were identified.
The regression models using eight of the PROMIS global items (quality of life, physical activities, mental health, emotional problems, social activities, pain, and fatigue and either general health or physical health items) explained 65% of the variance in the EQ-5D. When the PROMIS domain scores were included in a regression model, 57% of the variance was explained in EQ-5D scores. Comparisons of predicted to actual EQ-5D scores by age and gender groups showed that they were similar.
NET patients demonstrated significantly lower on all HRQoL subscales when compared with the general population with the lowest values on general health, physical limitation and vitality. Individuals above 70 years reported lower scores on physical functioning and physical limitations compared with those who were younger. Individuals with higher levels of education reported increased physical functioning compared with those with less education and full-time or part-time workers described higher physical functioning and less physical limitations compared with those who were retired.
Patients ranked emotional well-being as most important and the loss of social-family well-being as the most difficult to do without. A weighting algorithm revealed no advantage to incorporating individuals' domain preferences in HRQOL assessment; however, preliminary evidence suggested that HRQOL measurement may be more accurate in predicting outcomes for individuals with no distinct domain preferences than those with distinct preference profiles.
Thirty-nine relevant articles were identified. The SEIQoL-DW has been included in studies relating to a variety of populations, including those who are severely ill. The results of convergent and discriminant validity support our hypotheses in which SEIQoL-DW was expected to correlate moderately to high with measures of global QoL, life satisfaction and mental health and weakly with measures of functional status and health.
Factor analysis of the satisfaction measure revealed a one-factor structure and suggested the removal of one nonloading item, producing a 16-item scale (FAMCARE-P16) with high internal reliability. Patient satisfaction was not correlated with performance status, but was inversely associated with symptom burden, particularly with depression and anxiety.
Low levels of missing SF-36 data were observed across all groups. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized SF-36 scale structure for the Dutch and Turkish group, but high correlations between the MH and VT factors were observed in the Moroccan group. All Cronbach's alpha coefficients were above 0.70, except for the Vitality scale in the Moroccan group and the Vitality and Social Functioning scales in the Moroccan-Arabic language subgroup. Known-groups validity was found across samples using age, sex, education, and comorbidity as grouping variables, but not marital status. Some evidence for DIF was found in both ethnic group samples.
The respondents with both diabetes and hypertension had the lowest HRQoL on all eight subscales of SF36. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that the assumption of equivalent factor loadings for participants with and without diabetes and/or hypertension was not satisfied. Biomedical service use was significantly associated with the SF36 physical health factor in those with hypertension only. Help seeking from traditional healers was significantly negatively related to physical factor scores for all the respondents except those with diabetes only.
Activation of TLR8, but not TLR7, augmented IL-8 release. The R848-augmented IL-8 release was significantly potentiated by pretreatment with H2O2 (p &lt; 0.01), and N-acetyl-L-cysteine reversed this potentiation. The combination of H2O2 and R848 significantly potentiated NF-kB phosphorylation and IkBalpha degradation. The H2O2-potentiated IL-8 release was suppressed by MG-132, a proteosome inhibitor, and by dexamethasone. The expressions of TLR8, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were not affected by H2O2.
Varimax rotated confirmatory factor analysis identified the six original subscales, namely Child, Divine, Fate, Media, Parental, and Professional influences over child health. Internal consistency of the subscales was good (alpha &gt; .70), and test-retest correlations were adequate (r &gt; .80). More highly educated mothers rated media influence as most important. No differences were found considering children's age, gender, and birth order.
Out of 46 cases showing fatty change, pansteatosis was observed in 24 (52%) patients: 12 (26%) cases had a pericentral and mid zonal distribution of fat globules and eight (17.5%) cases revealed a mid zonal pattern only. There were two (4.5%) cases in which fat globules were found in periportal and mid zonal areas. None of the histological parameters (the stage of fibrosis and grades of inflammation) had any significant correlation with these distribution patterns of steatosis. The diameter of fat droplets was quantified by morphometry. A mixed pattern of steatosis was observed more frequently (21 out of 46 cases): 17 cases had microglobules and eight biopsies showed macroglobules. The size of the fat globules exhibited a significant correlation with the stage of fibrosis (P &lt; 0.0001). The analysis of the grades of necroinflammation did not reveal any significant relationship with the diameter of fat globules.
The mean age of the pediatric patients was 28 +/- 20 months. Different types of corrosives were encountered. The most common type was 5.25% hypochlorite in 36 patients (50%), kerosene in 12 patients (16.7%), caustic soda in nine patients (12.5%), hydrogen chloride and N-alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (HC and ADB) in eight patients (11.1%), and other material in seven patients (9.7%). Endoscopy was done in 30 patients (31.7%), 14 of whom were abnormal. Barium swallow was performed in 11 patients; five of them showed strictures that required frequent dilatation whereas one needed interposition surgery.
Of 1873 patients, there were 746 with gastric cancer and 1138 with colorectal cancer. According to the Kaplan-Meier method 1, 3, 5, and 7-year survival rates were 71.2, 37.8, 25.3, and 19.5%, respectively, in gastric cancer patients and 91.1, 73.1, 61, and 54.9%, respectively, in patients with colorectal cancer. Also, univariate analysis showed that age at diagnosis, sex, grade of tumor, and distant metastasis were of prognostic significance in both cancers (P &lt; 0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only distant metastasis in colorectal cancer and age at diagnosis, grade of tumor, and distant metastasis in colorectal cancer were identified as independent prognostic factors influencing survival.
After ER, 66 patients (34.4%) suffered from dysphagia to solids and 50 patients (26%) required at least one or three postoperative dilatations for alleviation of symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux was seen in 32 patients (16.66%) and was more common in thoracic anastomosis patients than in cervical anastomosis patients. Heartburn was present in 33 cases (17%), 30 of whom required medication (37%). The number of meals per day was three to four in 116 patients (60%), more than four in 51 patients (29%), and less than three in 19 patients (9.82%). The number of bowel movement per day increased in 52 patients (27%), decreased in 60 cases (31%), and unchanged in 80 patients (41%). Weight gain was reported by 38 patients (19.8%), and weight loss was reported by 50 patients (26%). No change in weight occurred in 100 patients (52%). Overall satisfaction was excellent in 29 patients (15%). Overall quality of life (work, pain-relief, vitality, and emotional status) was lower than in general population. Age, sex, and stage of cancer did not affect the functional outcome but affected the quality of life. Also patients who received cervical anastomosis and ER with colon had significantly fewer reflux symptoms. Most of the patients with colon reconstruction gained weight.
Significantly higher frequencies of the CTLA-4 +49A allele and A/A homozygous individuals were observed in patients with CD when compared with controls (pc = 0.0023 and pc = 0.0003, respectively). Analysis of CTLA-4 A/G polymorphism with respect to sex in CD showed a significant difference in A/A genotypes between female patients and controls (pc = 0.0001 and pc = 0.038, respectively). There were no differences in the subgroups of patients with CD.
Between 2004 and 2005, 18 112 healthy children up to 18 years of age were examined. All were term and appropriate for gestational age. There were 9 130 boys and 8 982 girls, yielding a nearly 1:1 male to female ratio. The maximum palpable liver size below the costal margin was 2.4 cm. The median and + 2 SD liver span at birth were 4 and 6.9 cm, respectively. There was no difference in the liver span between boys and girls of up to 60 months of age. Thereafter, a difference could be seen increasing with age, with girls having smaller liver spans than boys.
The procedure was successful in 23 (92%) cases, and the mean duration of the procedure was 20 minutes (15-32 minutes). There were no procedural complications seen during a median follow-up of two weeks. The equipment and rings were cheaper when compared with that of the standard methods of securing the base of the appendix.
Overall, the UBT was positive in 86/314 (27.4%) students. It was positive in 45/103 (43.7%) intermediate school students and 41/211 (19.4%) secondary students. Out of the 55 students with chronic RAP, 40 (73%) were positive for H. pylori. Further, 62.9% and 82.1% were positive among the intermediate and secondary school students with RAP, respectively. The overall and specific odds ratios of RAP were 12.35 [95% confidence interval (C.I.) 6.30-24.22] and 10.40 (95% C.I. 1.75-11.73) for the intermediate school students and 22.69 (95% C.I. 7.99-64.44) for the secondary school students.
Sections from the rat liver receiving amiodarone examined by electron microscopy showed disrupted hepatocytes with increased vacuolations. Degenerated organelles and disrupted nuclei were observed. The microvilli of bile canaliculi were disrupted and the hepatocytes showed increased lipid contents. Both endothelial cells and Kupffer cells were damaged. Phospholipids inside the mitochondria showed a loss of cristae. Sections from the liver of rats received amiodarone and vitamin-E showed lesser effects, especially in depositions of phospholipids in the mitochondria and the whole organelles and the nucleus showed minor damage in comparison to the previous group.
Over a period of 15 years, we saw 133 Saudi patients with CD. They were predominantly young, with a median age of 26.2 years and male preponderance (2.3:1). The final diagnosis was established within 1 week of presentation in 47% of the patients. The leading symptoms were abdominal pain (88%), diarrhea (70%), bloating (61%), rectal bleeding (50%), weight loss (33%), constipation (24%) and perianal disease (23%). The diagnosis was established by endoscopy and histopathology. Ileocecal involvement was encountered in 40% of the patients.
Of all the patients studied, 92 had histopathologically positive appendicitis. The TLC was found to be significantly high in 90 patients who proved to have acute appendicitis, whereas CRP was high in only 88 patients and neutrophil percentage was raised in 91; four had a normal CRP level. Thus, TLC had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 97.82%, 55.55% and 91.8%, respectively. CRP had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 95.6%, 77.77% and 95.6% respectively. Percentage of neutrophil count had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 98.9%, 38.88% and 89.21%, respectively. When used in combination, there was a marked improvement in the specificity and the positive predictive value to 88.04% and 98.7%, respectively.
In this study, biliary ascariasis was found to be more common in females, 73.8% (31 patients). The most common presentation was upper abdominal pain in 95.2% of the patients (40 patients). Complications observed were obstructive jaundice in 28.56% (12 patients), cholangitis in 16.7% (seven patients), acute pancreatitis in 2.4% (one patient) and hepatic abscess in 2.4% (one patient). History of worm emesis was present in 38.1% (16 patients). History of previous cholecystectomy was present in 16.7% (seven patients) and endoscopic sphincterotomy in 4.8% (two patients). Ultrasound was the diagnostic tool of choice with 100% results. Conservative management was successful in 83.3% (35 patients). During follow-up, worm reinvasion of the biliary system occurred in 7.1% (three patients).
Gastric lymphocyte infiltration was more prominent in the antrum (P = 0.01). Neutrophil infiltration was mild and gastric mucosal atrophy was rare. No relationship was found between virulence factors and histopathological changes.
Open liver resection and hydatid cyst surgery cases were included. There were 24 cases, with 13 males and 11 females. The age range was from 4 to 80 years, with a mean of 48 years (SD +/- 17.7). The number of leak sites that could be sutured were 0-4 (mean of 2.3 +/- 0.5). None had bile leak postoperatively.
Lifestyle trends associated with changes in hip circumference were (women/men): higher education level (+4.0 mm/+2.4 mm), fewer smokers (+0.4 mm/+0.9 mm), a slight increase in alcohol consumption (+0.4 mm/+0.3 mm), and more saturated fat from meat in women (-0.9 mm) and more fibre from grains in men (+0.6 mm). Average waist circumference was influenced by increased levels of physical activity (-2.2 mm/-4.6 mm), fewer female smokers (-0.3 mm), and a higher intake of saturated fatty acids from meat among men (+1.8 mm).
Seven per cent of the participants reported limitations in mobility, and 8% reported limitations in ADL. However, more than half of the participants had difficulties in performing one or more items in the performance tests. According to the MNA, 26% of the participants were undernourished and 62% were at risk of malnutrition. More undernourished participants than well-nourished participants reported limited mobility, impaired ADL and difficulties in the performance tests. A corresponding reduction in grip strength was observed in the undernourished group. Accordingly, higher MNA scores, indicating better nutritional status, were significantly associated with higher mobility index, higher ADL index, higher performance tests index, and higher scores in handgrip strength. These associations remained after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and health status differences.
Mean BMI as well as prevalence of overweight and obesity increased in the cohort; most among younger persons. In all groups but younger women, BMI increase was greatest in the lowest baseline BMI quartile. Low education was associated with increased BMI at baseline, but not with BMI change over time except among young women. Exercisers had lower BMI than non-exercising persons, and exercise pattern over time was also significantly associated with BMI change. The greatest BMI increase was found among exercise drop-outs, while those who had taken up exercise during the study period were the only group who did not show a significant BMI increase over the study period. Job strain showed inconsistent associations with BMI change.
In the experimental group post-test examination revealed that cardiorespiratory fitness had improved significantly as the number of minutes completed in 20SRT increased. A similar situation was observed in the case of sense of coherence. No such findings were observed in the control group, and in a post-test comparison both the average results in 20SRT and in sense of coherence were statistically (p50.05) lower than in the experimental group.
An additive random effects model was found to be superior to ordinary least squares, fixed effects, random coefficient and censored Tobit modelling approaches. From the 11 model specifications tested, the TTO3 model (main effects model, without an N3 factor) performed best and was used to generate a Danish set of health state preferences.
The study showed that fathers were more likely than mothers to report that children had been drinking or tasting alcohol at home. Parents who answered the questionnaire together also stated that their children had been served alcohol at home to a larger extent than mothers. Fathers, single parents and parents with older children were more likely to have non-restrictive attitudes towards adolescents and alcohol than mothers, parents living in a household with more than one adult, and parents with younger children. Factors such as age of the parents, employment status and numbers of children in the household were not associated with either parental attitudes or behaviour.
Of these men 21% (n = 179) were snuff users, 13% (n = 109) current smokers, and 65% (n = 546) were non-users. Of all snuff users 65% (n = 116) were former smokers, and 35% (n = 63) were exclusive snuff users (current users who never smoked). Among non-users 65% (n = 357) were never users and 35% (n = 189) had quit smoking without nicotine substitution. These men were characterized by abdominal obesity; OR 1.84 (1.08-3.12) (p = 0.002) (WHR 41.0) and OR 1.71 (1.08-2.72) (p = 0.022) (waist circumference 4102 cm). One can/week use of snuff among ex-smokers was associated with a 1.21 cm wider (0.05-2.36) (p = 0.041) waist circumference and 0.01 (0.00-0.02) units higher (p = 0.021) WHR. There were statistically significant associations between former smoking without current nicotine substitute and both general and abdominal obesity. No similar association with abdominal obesity was seen among exclusive snuff users.
The word ;;effectiveness'' occurred in the planning, organization and evaluation of service activities and in the definitions and justifications for the goal states of research and development work. Although objectives were justified by effectiveness, the occurrence and use of the term were not grounded on proven effectiveness but rather represented an ideal being pursued. Use of the word ;;effectiveness'' increased from 2001 to 2006, particularly in the political-administrative decision-making of large hospital districts. This article gives useful information regarding the benefits of effectiveness in political-administrative decision-making.
Norwegian hospital doctors had significantly higher life satisfaction (mean 5.31 vs. 5.15) and job satisfaction (mean 5.09 vs. 4.55) than their German colleagues. Item by item, doctors in Norway were significantly more content with seven aspects of their work: "Freedom to choose your own methods of working'' (mean 5.00 vs. 4.72), "opportunities to use your skills'' (mean 5.49 vs. 5.01), "physical working conditions'' (mean 4.62 vs. 4.08), "recognition you get for good achievements'' (mean 4.83 vs. 4.26), "overall job situation'' (mean 5.57 vs. 4.64), "work hours'' (mean 4.39 vs. 3.39), "ate of pay'' (mean 4.70 vs. 3.70). General life satisfaction and age, but not gender, were positively associated with job satisfaction in both countries.
In a random sample from the general Danish population, the mean EQ-5D index score ranged between 0.93 for 20-29 year-olds and 0.83 for 70-79 year-olds. Men had a significantly higher score than women in all age groups. Longer education was associated with higher EQ-5D index score in most age groups.
There were 172,000 lung cancer deaths among men in the EU in 2002. If all EU countries had the LCMR of men in Sweden, there would have been 92,000 (54%) fewer deaths. In contrast, the LCMR among Swedish women was the sixth highest in the EU; at the Swedish rate, deaths among EU women would have increased by 14,500 (26%). These LCMR patterns were in place for most of the last 50 years, and LCMRs among Swedish men can be correlated with snus and cigarette consumption.
Overall, no pronounced difference in mortality rate was found in the population between geographical areas. For men, mortality rates differed only between geographical residence in the time intervals 1991-95 and 1996-2000 for the age groups 45-59 years and 60-74 years, respectively, with outside SUF area, inland having the lowest rate. For women, there were no differences between geographical areas except for the age group 60-74 years in the time period 1991-95, where SUF coast had the highest mortality rate. For the SUF area, men had the lowest probabilities for surviving the age of 74 years and women had among the highest. No geographical difference was found in infant mortality. During the time period 1991-2006, the outside SUF area, inland had an average infant mortality rate of 1.8/1000 per year, and for SUF coast it was 6.2/1000 per year. This difference was, however, not significant (p = 0.08).
Men and women who had an in-patient episode for IHD had lower age-standardized employment rates than the general population. Following hospital admission, the likelihood of patients with IHD leaving employment increased annually, and by 2001 their adjusted odds were almost four times greater (odds ratio 3.95, 95% confidence interval 3.23-4.83) than for the general population. The impact of IHD on employment was more severe with decreasing social class and patients employed in low-skilled manual occupations were significantly more likely to lose employment than professional workers with the same diagnosis. Within each social class patients had significantly higher odds of leaving employment than the general population.
Successful oral antibiotic bowel preparation requires effective mechanical preparation. The progressive shift of preoperative preparation to the outpatient setting has led to a reduction in the use of oral antibiotics. Such preparation, however, continues to be effective although in current surgical practice is often augmented with perioperative, parenteral antimicrobials.
Among the patients with Ck infection, there were three pancreas recipients with intra-abdominal infection, one liver recipient with cholangitis, one lung recipient with pleural empyema, one patient with pleural empyema after esophageal perforation, and one case of pneumonia in a patient with a ventricular assist device. Treatment consisted of caspofungin (n = 3), voriconazole (n = 1), or a combination of the two (n = 2) together with surgery (n = 3) or pigtail catheter drainage (n = 3). One patient underwent drainage without antifungal treatment, and one patient did not have drainage. The infection was controlled in all cases. The patient with the assist device died from multiple organ dysfunction, the lung recipient died after four months from graft failure, and one pancreas graft was lost. Four patients (57%) harbored the same Ck strain.
During a four-year period, 637 SMG-positive samples from 475 patients, including 45 positive blood cultures from 25 patients (7.1%), were identified. In one pediatric patient, the SMG was a contaminant, so 24 patients (5.1%) with 44 positive blood cultures (6.9%) were available for further evaluation. The study group consisted of 17 male and seven female patients with a median age of 56 years and a median hospital stay of 23 days (range 8-83 days). In 21 patients, monomicrobial SMG blood stream infection was found, whereas in three patients, polymicrobial infection was diagnosed (coagulase-negative staphylococci in two, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis in one). The source of the organism in the blood was intra-abdominal infection in six cases, soft tissue infection in another six cases, and cardiovascular and nervous system infection in three cases each. In the remaining cases, miscellaneous sources were identified. In 14 infected patients (58.3%), surgical interventions were performed before SMG bacteremia was diagnosed. All patients received antibiotic treatment with a median duration of 11.5 d (range 6-25 d). Five patients died, but no death was related directly to SMG infection.
Application of gelatin matrix resulted in more cfu/g of tissue and an 87% infection rate, with fewer cfu/g of tissue and a 14% and 24% infection rate in the control and MPH groups, respectively.
Of 455 cardiovascular and 1,034 orthopedic surgery patients, 415 (55.6% of the cardiovascular patients and 15.7% of the orthopedic patients) were given ABT. The overall rate of PI during hospitalization was 5.8%. The relative risk of PI was 3.6-fold greater after ABT (50 patients; 12.1%) than in patients not having ABT (36 patients; 3.4%; 95% confidence interval 2.4, 5.4; p = 0.001). Postoperative infections appeared both during hospitalization (n = 86) and within four weeks after discharge (n = 81).
Silver has been used for at least six millennia to prevent microbial infections. It has been effective against almost all organisms tested and has been used to treat numerous infections and noninfectious conditions, sometimes with striking success. Silver also has played an important role in the development of radiology and in improving wound healing.
Little or no evidence supports the use of silver on or in implanted devices, long-term transcutaneous devices, or topical dressings. Short-term transcutaneous devices (e.g., implantation for 2-10 days) may be afforded protection from infection.
The true incidence of neutropenic enterocolitis is unknown, but may be 5% or more among adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid malignant tumors. The incidence is reported to be slightly lower in children. Estimates are made complex by recent recognition that neutropenia of any cause may be associated with enterocolitis; reports of non-chemotherapy drug-associated cases are increasing. Mortality rates are reported currently to be between 30% to 50%. The exact pathogenesis is also unknown, and may contribute to the varied nomenclature in use. Gut mucosal ulcerations may result from direct drug-related cytotoxicity, or from neutropenia itself. Microbial invasion of the bowel wall proceeds unimpeded. Pathological changes include inflammation and edema, presumably followed by ulceration, transmural necrosis, and perforation. The classic clinical presentation consists of fever, abdominal pain, and neutropenia, but diagnosis is often hindered by subtle or non-specific clinical findings, making computed tomography the linchpin of diagnosis. The wide spectrum of clinical presentation requires an individualized approach to therapy. Medical management, including administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, may be appropriate for patients who do not have gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonitis, or intestinal perforation. Surgical management is generally reserved for patients who fall into any of the exceptional categories, and consists usually of bowel resection and stoma creation.
The practical and statistical issues faced by STAMPEDE in implementing MAMS methodology are discussed and contrasted with those for traditional trials. These issues include the choice of intermediate and final outcome measures, sample size calculations and the impact of varying the assumptions, the process for moving between trial stages, stopping accrual to each trial arm and overall, and issues around perceived trial complexity.
The overall prevalence of absence both unilaterally and bilaterally in the two sexes was 6.7%. In males, unilateral absence was 5.4%. The distribution on the right and left were 2.4% and 3.0% respectively. The bilateral absence was 1.5%. In females, unilateral absence was 6.0%. The distribution on the right and left were 2.6% and 3.4% respectively. Bilaterally, it was 0.4%. In one subject unilaterally, PL was observed to have differentiated from flexor carpi radialis.
84 eyes met the study criteria. Follow-up time from surgery was 93 to 147 months (median 127 months). The average axial length was 28.72 mm (sd 1.37). Two eyes developed post-operative RRD; the incidence was 2.4% and the rate one RRD per 441.6 person-years. The results of 15 other studies on the incidence of RRD after cataract extraction in high myopia were pooled and combined with our estimate.
Nineteen (F = 16) patients were found to have non-epithelial breast malignancies between April 1994 and August 2007. Mean age was 61.6 years (range 25-86). 17 patients (89.5%) presented with a palpable lump, mastalgia or skin change, while 2 (10.5%) patients' tumours were detected through screening. The histological types of non-epithelial malignancies were as follows: lymphoma (n = 8; M = 1 and F = 7, mean age: 68.5 range 52-86), sarcoma (n = 5; M = 1 and F = 4, mean age 56.4 range 29-69), malignant melanoma (n = 3; M = 1 and F = 2, mean age 54.3 range 25-70), multiple myeloma (n = 1; F, 71), metastatic renal cell carcinoma (n = 1; F, 63) and metastatic carcinoid tumour (n = 1; F, 52). The mean follow-up was 1541 days (32-4589 days). Nine patients were alive at the end of follow-up. Only 1 of 11 deaths was not directly related to the malignancy. The average time from surgery to death was 798.5 days (range 32-3248 days).
There were 214 men and 5 women. Patients ranged from 18 to 87 years of age (mean 54 years). Seventy two percent of postal questionnaires were returned. Following telephone calls the overall response rate was 80%. The mean follow up period was 60 months (range: 9 - 132 months). Immediate complications were similar in both groups. The recurrence rates were 1.1% for Lichtenstein repair and 6.3% for Kugel patch (p= 0.09). None of the patients in the Lichtenstein group and 1.6% of patients in Kugel patch group complained of severe chronic pain in inguinal region.
The mean patient age was 64.2 years, with a mean prebiopsy PSA level of 8.5 ng/mL. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 97 patients (44.7%). The study population had undergone an average of 1.8 +/- 1.0 biopsies before TTMB. PSAV did not predict for prostate cancer diagnosis (P = .84), Gleason score (P = .78), the percentage of positive cores (P = .37), or tumor location.
DCs transduced with survivin gene could induce survivin-specific CTLs against various urologic malignancies such as bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer cells. This cytotoxic activity could be blocked by anti-CD8 and anti-major histocompatibility complex class I antibodies. We also found that this cytotoxic activity was specific for the survivin protein and human leukocyte antigen haplotype.
Testosterone (0.1-300 microM) produced relaxation in human corpus cavernosum (maximum relaxation 65.4% +/- 3.3% of KCl-induced contraction) that reached a maximum at a concentration of 300 microM. Testosterone-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated by glibenclamide, but it was not affected by the other K(+) channel inhibitors (tetraethylammonium, barium chloride, or 4-aminopyridine).
U. urealyticum was detected from &gt; or =1 site in 81 women (52.9%), and M. hominis was detected in 5 patients (3.3%), always in association with U. urealyticum. At follow-up, 77 patients (95.1%) initially positive for Mycoplasma had negative cultures; the cultures of 4 (4.9%) remained positive for U. urealyticum and became negative after the second therapeutic regimen. A significant improvement in all symptoms was observed in women with positive cultures for Mycoplasma after therapy.
A total of 304 (88.4%) patients had negative surgical margins in the radical cystectomy specimen, and 40 (11.6%) had positive surgical margins. On univariate analysis, positive surgical margins conferred a significant risk of poorer clinical outcomes. The 5-year overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rate was 9% and 18% for patients with positive margins compared with 48% and 65% for patients with negative margins, respectively. The multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant independent risk of decreased recurrence-free survival, DSS, and OS for patients with positive surgical margins. The corresponding hazard ratios were 2.29 (95% confidence interval 1.54-3.41, P &lt; .001), 1.71 (95% confidence interval 1.15-2.56, P &lt; .009), and 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.23-2.34, P &lt; .001). Despite these findings, patients with positive margins and node-negative disease experienced improved DSS and recurrence-free survival (P = .001 P and = .009, respectively) if &gt;15 lymph nodes were removed during surgery.
At day 28 of the trial, the Amlodipine plus terazosin group demonstrated comparable efficacy in lowering the total International Prostate Symptom Score and significant improvement in the presence of overactive bladder compared with the terazosin group (P &lt; .05) and significant improvement in quality of life compared with the Amlodipine group (P &lt; .05). The Amlodipine plus terazosin group also achieved the greatest blood pressure control compared with either the terazosin group (P &lt; .01) or Amlodipine group (P &lt; .05). All 3 treatment regimens were well tolerated by the study patients.
Gefitinib alone did not significantly reduce cell viability in any of the examined cell lines. Although in each line, the phosphorylation of EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited by 0.1 muM gefitinib, the phosphorylation of Akt was constitutive and was not inhibited by even 10 muM gefitinib. In 786-O cells, the phosphorylation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt was inhibited by gefitinib used in combination with either LY294002 or the knockdown of Akt expression, and the viability of 786-O cells was suppressed significantly by gefitinib used in combination with LY294002 (P &lt; .0001) or Akt small interfering RNA (P = .0044).
All PDE-5 inhibitors tested (0.001-10 micromol/L) relaxed phenylephrine-precontracted HCC with similar values of potency in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the maximal relaxations induced by tadalafil (83% +/- 4%) were significantly lower compared with sildenafil (107% +/- 5%) and vardenafil (111% +/- 3%). The NO synthesis inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (100 micromol/L) caused significant rightward shifts in the concentration-response curves for sildenafil (4.0-fold), vardenafil (4.6-fold), and tadalafil (3.2-fold) in HCC tissue. The guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (10 micromol/L) also produced similar rightward shifts for these PDE-5 inhibitors. The cavernosal relaxations evoked by either acetylcholine or the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate were markedly potentiated by sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil (0.1 micromol/L each). All PDE-5 inhibitors significantly increased the duration of electrical field stimulation-induced relaxations (8 Hz).
A total of 10,180 personnel were demobilized and 6153 surveys were received during a 9-month period, for a survey response rate of 60%. Of the personnel returning survey, 1% reported urolithiasis during their deployment. The personnel who reported urolithiasis were slightly older than those who did not (32.6 vs 29 years old, P &lt; .00038). The odds of reporting urolithiasis during deployment were 30.9 times greater for personnel with a history of stone disease and 2.4 times greater for those with a family history of stone disease. No difference was found in the rates of urolithiasis with regard to sex or race. Also, no strong evidence for an association between the rates of reported urolithiasis and seasonal variations in temperature in Southwest Asia was found.
Drawings, engravings, and sculptures displaying humans are relatively scarce, and &lt;100 examples of male genitals are specifically represented. Some depict a circumcised penis and other represent urologic disorders such as phimosis, paraphimosis, discharge, priapism, or a scrotal mass. In addition, a small number of phalluses carved in horn, bone, or stone, with varying morphology, has survived to the present and also reveals a sustained cult for male erection and foreskin retraction not limited to a particular topographical territory. The very few noncoital human or humanoid figures with marked erection appear in a context of serious danger or death. Therefore, erection could be understood as a phenomenon related to the shamanic transit between life and death.
Speculum examination was possible in all but 1 patient and was easy in 78% of the patients. Median vaginal length was 7 cm. A regular digital vaginal examination was possible in 44% of the patients, the vagina was rather mobile and with limited scar tissue on average. In 48% of the patients, the prostate was palpable. In 94% of the patients, the prostate was visible on transvaginal ultrasound. Mean prostate volume was 14 mL, calcifications were present in 33%, and none had cysts. Capsule of the prostate was well delineated in 74% and seminal vesicles were visualized in 80%. All examinations were very well tolerated and nearly painless.
The temperature of the ventral penile skin was 20 degrees C and 36 degrees C in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The rate of urethral stricture was 21.3% in group 1 and 6.3% in group 2 at the end of 6 months of follow-up (P = .002).
We identified 914 infants hospitalized at our institution from January 1996 to December 2007, with an ICD-9-coded diagnosis of UTI. Of these 914 infants, 258 were subsequently given a urologic diagnosis. However, only 130 of these patients had well-documented UTI (14.2% of 914 children). Of this cohort, 55.4% were boys. The most common diagnoses were hydronephrosis (37.7%), vesicoureteral reflux (69.2%), and obstructive uropathy (23.1%).
At 3 months to 6 years of follow-up (mean 36.2 months), 0.6% and 0.3% of patients had developed a measurable PSA level or biochemical recurrence, respectively. The single patient with biochemical recurrence responded to salvage radiotherapy, strongly suggesting a malignant etiology for the recurrence.
In the 92 complications identified, 59 (64%), 21 (23%), and 12 (13%) failures of endoscopic staplers, titanium clips, and locking clips had occurred, respectively. The most common mechanisms of stapler failure were missing/malformed staple lines (51%) and failure to release (25%). The most common titanium clip failures resulted from scissoring or malformation (52%), jamming (19%), and dislodgement (14%). Clip dislodgement was most common with the locking clip, either postoperatively in 7 (58%) or intraoperatively in 3 (25%). Intraoperative conversions were required for 21 (36%), 1 (5%), and 2 (17%) for staplers, titanium clips, and locking clips, respectively. The estimated overall failure rate was 3.0% for staplers, 4.9% for titanium clips, and 1.7% for locking clips.
The incidence of obesity was greater in group 2 than in group 1, and this difference was statistically significant among male patients with SF. The urinary pH and total urine volume were lower and the excretion of uric acid was greater in group 2 than in group 1. The incidence of metabolic abnormalities such as low urine volume was more common in group 2 than in group 1. The incidence of hyperuricosuria was increased in male patients with SF in group 2 compared with that in the men in group 1. However, no significant differences were found in the incidence of hyperuricosuria in the female patients with SF between groups 1 and 2.
In the 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database, the sex distribution among pediatric patients with stone formation varied significantly by age. In the first decade of age, a male predominance was found that had shifted to a female predominance in the second decade. Overall, however, girls in the pediatric population were more commonly affected by stones than were boys.
The mean primary tumor size was similar in both groups; however, 67% of the RNIVCT embolization group vs 48% of the nonembolization group had retrohepatic (level III) or supradiaphragmatic (level IV) thrombus extension (P = .032). The RNIVCT embolization patients had a greater median number of perioperative units transfused (8 vs 4; P = .001), a longer operative time (390 vs 313 minutes; P &lt; .001), more postoperative complications (43% vs 29%; P &lt; .001), a longer intensive care unit stay (2 vs 0.5 days), and increased perioperative mortality (13% vs 3%; P = .017). No differences were found in intraoperative complications or length of hospitalization. Multivariate analysis showed a fivefold greater risk of perioperative death (adjusted odds ratio 5.5; P = .029) and a trend toward increased blood transfusion (regression coefficient 3.9; P = .08) with preoperative embolization.
The 24 children, aged 2-14 years (mean 7) underwent 53 ESWL sessions. Of the 24 children, 10 had stones located in the left kidney and 14 had stones located in the right kidney. The stone size was 25-35 mm (average 31). The average number of shock waves was 3489 per session. All children underwent lithotripsy with a gradual incremental energy increase from 14 to 20 kV. The overall stone-free rate was 83.3%. Four patients had clinically insignificant fragments and were followed up for the possibility of stone regrowth, microscopic hematuria, and urinary tract infection. Complications affected 25% of patients.
Overall, 333 men attended the program. Of the 328 men, 123 (37.5%) met our definition of ED; 30 (9%) were using a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and 93 (28%) had an SHIM score of 17 or less. Univariate analysis suggested a significant difference in the prevalence of ED between African-American men and non-African-American men, with 25% and 41%, respectively, found to have a SHIM score of 17 or less (P &lt; .01); however, this difference was not significant once we controlled for age (P &gt; .05). Among our participants, 33% lacked a primary care physician. Of these, 22% had a SHIM score of 17 or less.
The average preoperative PSA values were significantly different between the TURP, HoLRP, and OP groups. Only 1 patient had incidental CaP in the HoLRP group. No differences were present between the preoperative PSA values for patients with histologic BPH and those with incidental CaP undergoing a watchful waiting strategy (P &gt; .05). However, the postoperative PSA values were increased in the patients with CaP (watchful waiting compared with the patient with BPH only (2.4 vs 1.7 ng/mL TURP and 4.1 vs 1.1 ng/mL OP). Similarly, patients with incidental CaP had a significantly elevated postoperative mean PSA velocity compared with patients without CaP (0.38 vs 0.06 ng/mL/y TURP and 0.47 vs -0.13 ng/mL/y OP; P &lt; .05).
Of the 62,833 respondents to the 2006 U.S. National Health and Wellness Survey, 13,957 case-control pairs were matched. The presence of lower urinary tract symptoms, including OAB/UI symptoms, was significantly associated with increased resource use (emergency room visits, odds ratio -1.57, 95% confidence interval -1.47-1.68; hospitalizations, odds ratio -1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.43-1.69; medical provider visits, odds ratio -1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.41-1.63), 8.03% greater overall work productivity loss (P &lt; .001), 12.88% greater activity impairment (P &lt; .001), and decreased health- related quality of life (mental scores, 4.07 points lower [P &lt; .001]; physical scores, 4.14 points lower [P &lt; .001]).
Of the 1724 men with a regular sexual partner included in the present study (mean age 57.74 years), 263 (15.3%) reported alpha-blocker use. alpha-Blocker use was associated with a decreased risk of sexual dysfunction across all domains for men &gt; or =50 years old (age-adjusted hazard ratio 0.53-0.69). A decreased risk of erectile dysfunction and low libido remained significant only among those using alpha-blockers who also experienced an improvement in LUTS (P = .01).
From 2003 to 2008, 21 renal units (15 patients) with previous urinary diversion surgery underwent attempted retrograde ureteral access. The indications for retrograde access included treatment of nephrolithiasis in 5, ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture in 9, upper tract filling defects in 3, positive cytology findings in 1, and known upper tract malignancy in 3. We made 28 retrograde access attempts. Of these, 21 (75%) were successful. The success rate for each type of urinary diversion was 90% (9/10) for orthotopic neobladders, 73% (11/15) for ileal conduits, and 33% (1/3) for Indiana pouches. All 6 attempts to access the renal units for ureteroscopic management of suspected upper tract malignancy were successful. The access attempts were less successful in 5 of 10 patients (50%) with anastomotic stricture disease. No complications were reported.
The mean operative time was 59 +/- 7 minutes and 40 +/- 9 minutes (P = .015) and the mean hospital stay was 3.7 +/- 0.24 days and 4.4 +/- 0.46 days (P = .09) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The mean blood loss during surgery was 279 +/- 155 mL and 219 +/- 139 mL (P = .04) and the mean hemoglobin decrease was 2.3 +/- 1.4 g/dL and 1.6 +/- 1.5g/dL (P = .04) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The mean weight of the prostate was not significantly different statistically between the 2 groups at 63 +/- 23 g and 64 +/- 19 g in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = .8). The urethrocystoscopy examination at 3 months postoperatively revealed bladder neck contractures in 6.41% of the patients in group 1 and 3.85% in group 2.
NAC had significant improving effects on the volume, motility, and viscosity of semen. After NAC treatment, the serum total antioxidant capacity was greater and the total peroxide and oxidative stress index were lower in the NAC-treated group compared with the control group. These beneficial effects resulted from reduced reactive oxygen species in the serum and reduced viscosity of the semen. No significant differences were found in the number or morphology of the sperm between the 2 groups.
Pain during the LIA + SCB procedure (mean 1.7 +/- 1.6) was significantly less than the pain during LIA (mean 3.3 +/- 2.3; P &lt; .01). No statistically significant difference was found between the levels of pain experienced during LIA + SCB and no-needle jet anesthesia (P &gt;&gt; .01 and P &gt;&gt; .05, respectively). Intraoperative pain after LIA + SCB (mean 0.64 +/- 1.2) was significantly less than the intraoperative pain after LIA (mean 2.7 +/- 2.6; P &lt;&lt;&lt; .01). Also, the intraoperative pain after LIA + SCB was significantly less than the intraoperative pain after no-needle jet anesthesia (mean 2.13 +/- 2.0; P &lt;&lt;&lt; .01).
Metabolic syndrome, defined using a modified version of the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, was marginally associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in African-American men (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-3.01), but not in white men (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.64-1.62). After stratifying the patients by stage at diagnosis, African-American men with organ-confined disease were more likely to have a history of metabolic syndrome than were the controls (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.02-3.23), but no association was observed among those with advanced-stage disease (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.31-2.77). When evaluating the specific features of the metabolic syndrome, obesity was inversely related to prostate cancer among white men (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.80) but unrelated to risk among African-American men (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.70-1.89).
The clinical characteristics were not significantly different statistically, except for flank pain (14% vs 43%), renal cavitation (14% vs 44%), urolithiasis (0% vs 25%), and ureteral stricture formation (7% vs 39%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Anti-TB medication was given to 7 patients (30%) in group 2 despite the lack of a confirmed diagnosis. The outcome in terms of complications and renal function loss was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
The mean operative time in our series was 210 minutes, without any intraoperative or early postoperative complications. In 1 patient, a slight ureteral stricture was detected that resolved with reinsertion of a double-J stent. Histopathologic examination of the resected ureteral segments revealed sclerosis and muscular hypertrophy. All patients remained symptom free during the 1 year of follow-up.
Of the 1339 patients, 28 (2.1%) had acute bacterial prostatitis detected after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Acute prostatitis occurred after the first biopsy in 15 patients (1.3%) and after repeat biopsy in 13 (6.8%). The patients had developed infective symptoms a mean of 3 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Of the 28 patients, 17 (61%) had positive urine and/or blood cultures, including E. coli in 14. Of the 14 patients, 6 had acute prostatitis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. Bacteria isolated from urine were tested for drug susceptibility to a wide range of antibiotics. All patients with ESBL-producing E. coli were treated with imipenem. The bacteria detected in these urine cultures were resistant to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, sulbactam/ampicillin, and cefazolin. Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against ESBL-producing E. coli. ESBL-producing isolates had a significant reduction in activity for most antimicrobial agents, including fluoroquinolones and amikacin.
All flaps survived in their entirety. Wound infection occurred in 1 patient, and secondary healing was achieved with local wound care. The mean follow-up was 5 months. The vaginal depth remained stable, without evidence of orifice constriction.
NOTES transvaginal nephrectomy was successfully completed, with all the operative steps performed transvaginally. Dense pelvic adhesions from a prior hysterectomy necessitated the use of a 5-mm umbilical port during vaginal port placement and for retraction of the ascending colon during division of the renal hilum. No intraoperative complications occurred. Operative time was 307 minutes, with 124 minutes dedicated to vaginal port placement and 183 minutes dedicated to adhesiolysis and nephrectomy. The duration of hospitalization was 23 hours. The visual analog pain scale score was 1 of 10 on postoperative day 2.
Our methods of fragment amplification and sequencing confirmed that only 5 sequences inferred from pol region as subclade F1 also holds true for the genome as a whole and, thus, estimated the true prevalence at 0.56%. The results also showed a single phylogenetic cluster of the Brazilian subclade F1 along with non-Brazilian South American isolates in both subgenomic and the full-length genomes analysis with an overall intrasubtype nucleotide divergence of 6.9%. The nucleotide differences within the South American and Central African F1 strains, in the C2-C3 env, were 8.5% and 12.3%, respectively.
Patients showed a skeptical attitude toward xenotransplantation both when it was evaluated together with the human donor (P &lt; 0.01) or when it was evaluated separately (P &lt; 0.01). Differently, when asked to evaluate each donor separately healthy adults and students showed similar affective reactions toward the two alternatives (human organ and xenograft).
We first observed that the depletion of NK1.1 cells does not significantly interfere with graft survival in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. We used NKT cell deficient B6 mice to test the hypothesis that NKT cells are involved in islet and skin xenograft survival in our model. These mice bear a null mutation in the gene for the Jalpha18 component of the T-cell receptor. The component is uniquely associated with NKT cells. We found no difference in islet xenograft survival between Jalpha18(null) and wild type B6 mice. In contrast, median skin graft survival appeared shorter in Jalpha18(null) recipients. These data imply a role for Jalpha18(+) NKT cells in skin xenograft survival in treated mice. In order to confirm this inference, we tested skin xenograft survival in B6 CD1(null) mice because NKT cells are CD1 restricted. Results of these trials demonstrate that the absence of CD1(+) cells adversely affects rat skin graft survival. An additional assay in beta2M(null) mice demonstrated a requirement for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in the graft host, and we demonstrate that CD1 is the requisite MHC component. We further demonstrated that, unlike reports for allograft survival, skin xenograft survival does not require perforin-secreting NK cells.
We found that specific probes for all three candidate approaches successfully identified human cells in mixtures containing human and mouse genomes. However, probes for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease element or STRs for HLA regions were less effective for low numbers of transplanted human stem/progenitor cells in mice than human sex-determining region on Y-chromosome. None of the approaches could identify transplanted human cells constituting less than one percent of the total cell mass. This required localization of transplanted cells in tissue sections with human-specific in situ hybridization probes.
Elevated fasting blood glucose, pathologic IVGTT, destruction of 95% of beta-cell mass, and glycosylated hemoglobin (&gt;13%) were assessed in diabetic monkeys. The serum glucagon levels and glucagon cell mass correlated significantly with diabetes time course of diabetes (R = 0.940, p = 0.005; R = 0.663, p = 0.019, respectively). A mean increase of 89% in glucagon cell mass was observed for primates suffering from diabetes &gt;53 days. No response of glucagon secretion was observed for diabetic animals during IVGTT, because no increase of serum insulin levels followed glucose loading. Blood glucose levels dropped after pig islet xenografts in diabetic primates. This reduction was maintained by an insulin level &gt;20 microU/ml over the period of time of xenograft function (porcine C-peptide &gt;0.1 ng/ml). A total restoration of native primate glucagon sensitivity to insulin was found after pig islets xenotransplantation as revealed by a reduction of 80% of the glucagon level. When graft dysfunction (&gt;24 h post-transplantation), the insulin level dropped and glucagon levels rose again (&gt;50 pg/ml).
The anti-gag and -pol shRNAs, effectively knocked down expression of the PERV model-genes, and also endogenous PERV within cells in vitro. PERV knockdown was achieved whether the shRNA was expressed under the control of a RNA pol III, or a pol II promoter. Three litters of cloned pigs were produced. The shRNA construct was expressed by all the transgenic cloned animals, and within all the tissues of transgenic animals tested. PERV expression at the mRNA and PERV particulate levels in the pigs was virtually undetectable, compared with the infectious levels expressed by the positive control PK15 cell line in vitro. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting, with an anti-PERV-envelope antibody, did not detect PERV in pig tissues or cells whether activated or not, as compared to the positive control on PK15 cells.
Residual stress was retained in the adult-excised porcine trachea. The force of radial pedestal was detected as 10 N, when the diameter of a 50-mm trachea was compressed to 50%. The bursting strength decreased from 180 mmHg of pharyngeal portion to 110 mmHg in tracheal carina. When the trachea flexed forward or either right or left by 50 degrees , tension reached 0.296 to 0.131 N and 0.254 to 0.150 N, respectively. The curve of stress-straining measured, according to computer data and results, suggested that tension was maintained at a low level at 50% strain.
Alleles of MBL genes were detected in 10.8% of 415 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 66.7% of 12 P. putida isolates from 18 of 24 hospitals/laboratory. Among the 14 IMP-1-like and 39 VIM-2-like MBLs, emergence of IMP-6 was detected for the first time.
In this study, 34.4% of boys and 32.1% of girls showed dissatisfaction with their weight, whereas 26.2% of boys and 30.2% of girls showed dissatisfaction with their height. The obese group showed higher weight dissatisfaction than the normal or underweight groups (p &lt; 0.001). The short stature group showed higher dissatisfaction in their height than the normal group (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in total CBCL problems score according to weight or height status. The underweight and obese groups had higher score for social problems than normal weight group (p &lt; 0.05 respectively). There were no significant differences in each CBCL problem score by height status. As a whole, the prevalence rate of a CBCL total problems score in the clinical range was 3 percent (12/405). These children showed no difference in terms of weight or height, compared with normal students. Among the factors related, only school performance was negatively correlated with the total problems score (p &lt; 0.01).
Among a total of 412 pregnant nonsmokers, the proportions of self-reported exposure to second-hand smoke and positive urinary cotinine level were 60.4% and 3.4%, respectively. Among those, 4.8% of the participants who reported exposure to second-hand smoke had cotinine levels of 40 ng/mL (the kappa value = 0.029, p = 0.049). Among those who reported living with smokers (n = 170), "smoking currently permitted in the whole house" (vs. not permitted at home) was associated with positive urinary cotinine in the univariable analysis. Furthermore, this variable showed a significant association with positive urinary cotinine in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis [Odds ratio (OR), 15.6; 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 2.1-115.4].
Pre- and post swim-up AI were 30.8 +/- 3.4 and 17.8 +/- 4.5 in group I, and 31.4 +/- 3.6 and 16.3 +/- 4.7 in group II (p &gt; 0.05) respectively. The significant improvement in morphology and motility after double wash swim-up procedure has been observed. However, double wash swim-up procedure could not eliminate head and especially acrosomal defects which would directly effect fertilization capacity in conventional IVF program. In group I, 85.3% of oocytes were fertilized, with a 48% pregnancy rate; in group II, 71.0% of oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate of 20%. Fertilization and pregnancy rates were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) between the two groups.
OVX induced in a reduction in lumbar BMD compared with the sham controls and the baseline, as a result of increased serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary levels of cross-lined N- and C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen. Furthermore, OVX induced reductions in trabecular volumetric BMD and trabecular bone mass compared with the sham controls, with increased bone formation rate at the lumbar vertebra, femoral neck, and distal radius.
The outcome changes of vision acuity (p &lt; 0.001), vision function-14 (p &lt; 0.001), and symptom score (p &lt; 0.006) were significantly different between four appropriateness ratings (crucial, appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate). There was a trend that the appropriate rating surgeries were related to the successful change of the vision function (2.29, p = 0.015) and satisfaction with vision (3.84, p = 0.014) in 12 month postoperative period.
OLF cells exhibited various appearances compared with the typical fibroblast-like morphology of non-OLF cells. Expressions of collagen type I and collagen type III were observed in OLF and non-OLF cells. OLF cells uniquely expressed osteocalcin, which is a marker for osteoblasts, and collagen type II which is a marker for chondrocytes, whereas they were negative in non-OLF cells.
Ipsilateral reflex closure was consistently recorded regardless of anesthetic levels. However, contralateral reflex responses disappeared as anesthetic levels were deepened. Additionally, late responses (R2) were detected in one animal at lower level of anesthesia.
The CDIs (CCI and CAI) were significant (p &lt; 0.05) in the diagnosis of pectus excavatum, regardless of age (p = 0.4033, p = 0.8113). The CWCI and CWAI were significant (p &lt; 0.05) and significantly affected by age (p &lt; 0.05). If we selected 1.82 as the cutoff of the CCI, the sensitivity and specificity were 99.4% and 98%, respectively. The following cutoffs and the sensitivity and specificity were obtained: 1.15 for the CAI gave 94.4% and 94.5%, 3.05 for the CWCI gave 92.1% and 92%, and 1 for the CWAI gave 62.4% and 65%, respectively. The CCI after repair improved from 2.83 +/- 0.84 to 1.84 +/- 0.33, while the CWCI improved from 4.49 +/- 1.61 to 2.57 +/- 0.44.
The SOD and GPx activity showed tendencies to increase in the oligonol-treated group compared to the normal control group. TNF-alpha expression was slightly reduced in the oligonol-treated group. Western blotting demonstrated that phosphorylation of IkappaBa in the oligonol-treated group was significantly lower than in the normal control group. The E2 + DHT-treated group revealed severe atrophy of acinar epithelial cells and infiltration of leukocytes and lymphocytes in the prostate, however, the oligonol-treated group showed overall reduction in inflammatory features.
In 2D proteomic analysis, an increase of HSP60 expression was detected in cervical cancer tissues and confirmed by Western blot analysis (p &lt; 0.05). However, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of HSP60 did not display any significant differences between cervical cancer and normal tissues.
IGF-I was shown to be negatively correlated with age (women r = -0.62, p &lt; 0.001; men r = -0.38, p &lt; 0.05), whereas there was no correlation between IGF-I and GH values. Women &gt; 50 years showed a significant reduction in IGF-I values than women &lt; or = 50 years (p &lt; 0.01). Women &gt; 50 years showed smaller IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratios (0.177998 +/- 0.039404) than men of same age group (0.228326 +/- 0.050979, p &lt; 0.01) and women &lt; or = 50 years (0.247667 +/- 0.069411, p &lt; 0.01). Age was shown to positively correlate with GH/IGF-I (r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.05) and GH/IGFBP-3 ratios (r = 0.40, p &lt; 0.05) in women.
Fentanyl (10(-6), 3 x 10(-6) M) attenuated phenylephrine-induced contraction in the rat aorta. 5-Methylurapidil and BMY 7378 produced a parallel rightward shift in the phenylephrine concentration-response curve. The pA(2) values for 5-methylurapidil and BMY 7378 were estimated to be 7.71 +/- 0.15 and 8.99 +/- 0.24, respectively. Fentanyl (10(-6) M) attenuated phenylephrine-induced contraction in rings pretreated with 10(-9) M 5-methylurapidil, but did not alter the rings when pretreated with 3 x 10(-9) M BMY 7378. Pretreatment of the rings with chloroethylclonidine showed a 72.9 +/- 2.3% reduction in phenylephrine-induced maximal contraction.
Phase contrast X-ray microtomography of inflated lung samples showed individual alveolar structure on 3-D reconstruction. Phase contrast microradiographs of thin lung samples showed microstructure of lung, such as alveoli and bronchioles, and were well correlated with optical microscopic images.
Of the 27 elements of medical professionalism examined, the most important core element was thought to be 'life-long learning skills'. The level of professionalism in Korean medical students was mostly assessed to be less than the 3.0 mean score given by the professors. Medical students tended to rate themselves higher than did the professors for their level of medical professionalism.
After surgery, short-term ABG of 99 ears was (15.7+/-8.7) dB, matched-pairs t test with the numbers of before surgery, t=22.79, P&lt;0.01. The results of 45 ears (45.5%) with ABG&lt;10 dB or air conduction improved more than 30 dB were regarded as excellence. The air conduction of 88 ears (88.9%) improved more than 15 dB was regarded as utility. With 82 ears (82.8%) followed-up more than 1 year, the average ABG was (11.7+/-6.8) dB, matched-pairs t test with the numbers of before surgery, t=23.37, P&lt;0.01, compared with the short-term visit result [(15.3+/-9.2) dB, 82 ears], t=4.82, P&lt;0.01, both of which were considered statistically extremely significant. Among them, 50 ears (61.0%) have the excellent effect while 74 ears with (90.2%) ABG&lt;20 dB. The average bone conduction auditory threshold in 2 kHz was (34.5+/-15.0) dB before surgery, matched-pairs t test with short-term visit result (33.4+/-15.9) dB, t=1.96, P=0.026 14, with long-term visit result (32.7+/-15.2) dB, t=3.24, P=0.000 87, all of which had the significant difference, manifest that the Cohort's notch had been improved after the surgery. The data of bone conduction auditory threshold of 4 kHz with long-term following-up result matched-pairs t test with that of surgery before, t=0.76 (P&gt;0.05), which showed the change of the bone conduction had no statistics difference. There were 55 ears had the persistent tinnitus before surgery, in which 42 ears (76.4%) with no the tinnitus, 13 ears with same to that of preoperative, and 3 ears (3.0%) with remaining tinnitus after surgery but who had not it preoperation and all disappeared after 2 - 3 days. There were 12 ears (12.1%) with light dizzy after surgery, but their live could deal with himself and the average dizzy lasted 2.3 days.
Of the five patients with recurrent trigeminal neuralgia primarily, two underwent microvascular decompression (MVD); the remaining three firstly received the II and III branches partial sensory rhizotomy and, subsequently, the pain reoccurred in the I branch distribution area. The remnant sensor fibre was resected in the reoperation by which the sufferings were controlled completely in four of these patients during 2 to 11 years of follow-up. In five patients with hemifacial spasm underwent re-exploration, there appeared obvious fibrosis, conglutination, and the formation of new vessels around the facial nerve, with which the result of reoperation for this disorder was unsatisfied. In four glossopharyngeal neuralgia patients, reanastomosis of the glossopharyngeal nerve were found in two patients, adhesion between the glossopharyngeal nerve and the vagus nerve was found in one patient, but occurred in none of the another one. In the revision surgery, the regeneration of nerve fibre and two adjacent branches of vagus nerve fibre were resected, with no occurrence during 2 to 5 years of follow-up. The pathological changes found in revision were severe adhesion between cerebellum, meninges, terylene slim and structures around. Also, the formation of new vessels, cerebellum malacia, and bleeding could be found in the procedures.
The diseases of the patients included middle ear cholesteatoma in 25 ears and chronic suppurative otitis media in 38 ears. The surgical techniques involved three kinds: overlay tympanoplasty, overlay tympanoplasty with canal wall up mastoidectomy and overlay tympanoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy. In middle ear cholesteatoma and suppurative otitis media patients, the case received the three techniques are 4, 17, 4 ears and 19, 18, 1 ears respectively. All patients gained stage I incision cure. Followed up for 0.5 to 3.5 years respectively, the external auditory canal was wide and tympanic membrane gained a good shape. The hearing in all case kept intact or increased while hearing decrease did not occur. Complications were free in patients with punctual visit.
Unilateral ear of 26 patients was successfully operated. Among them, 5 cases were left ears and the remaining was right ears. All implant devices worked normally after 1 month. Had been followed up from 13 months to 4.3 years, 19 patients with OME were healed and the remaining was turning better. No evidence showed phenomenon of the eardrum perforation and acute attack of OME.
Of all 66 PC-BPPV cases, the four positions of PRM were found in 24 cases presented upward torsional nystagmus at the second or third position, 21 cases presented negative nystagmus except the first position, 7 cases presented intensity horizontal nystagmus during PRM and 14 cases presented downward nystagmus at the second or third position during PRM. Of all 66 cases, 78.8% of them were accord with canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis while the other may be related with otolith organ or nerve disease.
The maxillary sinus was the most common site of origin and account for 80% of all patients. Five-year and ten-year overall survival rate were 76.9% and 61.6% respectively. Five-year and ten-year disease-free survival rate were 44.2% and 23.0%. Five-year local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate were 45.0% and 23.0%, respectively. The most common site of distant metastasis was lung. Presence of distant metastasis correlated with decreased 5-year survival (chi2=7.26, P=0.007). The distant metastasis rate of preoperative treatment (18.2%) seemed lower than that of postoperative treatment (38.9%), but there was no significant difference in the two groups (chi2=1.37, P=0.24). The combined therapy mainly composed of surgery was adopted to treat the local recurrence. Five-year survival rate after development of local recurrence was 60.0%.
FEES with all consistencies revealed premature leakage in 48.1%, pooling in 75.0%, penetration in 69.2%, and aspiration in 55.8%, silent aspiration in 28.8% of patients. VF revealed above items in 44.2%, 63.5%, 57.7%, 46.2%, 21.2%, respectively. The FEES was then measured against the VF for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. FEES showed higher sensibility and negative coincidence rate of penetration (90.0%, 81.3%), aspiration (87.5%, 87.0%) and silent aspiration (90.9%, 97.3%). According to the severity, the dysphagia in patients was classified into no penetration, penetration, aspiration and silent aspiration. A weighted Kappa value of 0.713 signified "substantial" agreement between the two tests.
Among the 63 cases, 99 operations were accomplished in total, excluding tracheotomy and the closure operation for the fistula. Forty patients had experienced one operation (63.5%), 15 cases (23.8%) had 2 operations, 5 cases had 3 operations, 2 cases had 4 operations, and one case had 6 operations. Fifteen initially estimated as laryngotracheal stenosis with intact framework had supporting laryngoscopic surgery, 11 cases decannulated successfully after single operation. Primary laryngotracheal split and plasticity with T tube implantation were accomplished in 36 cases, with 20 cases decannulated. Among 10 cases experienced laryngotracheal split, skin graft in laryngotracheal cavity with T tube implantation, 7 decannulated. Among 6 cases of laryngotracheal split, pedicled hyoid flap transfer for reconstruction of the laryngotracheal framework defect, 4 cases decannulated. Tracheal and cricotracheal resection and end-end anastomosis were performed in 9 cases, 7 cases decannulated after single procedure. Two cases of subglottic stenosis with tracheoesophageal fistula were repaired with laryngotracheal plasticity in single procedure successfully. Fifty seven patients were decannulated after different procedures with variable hoarseness, within 6 months to 5 years follow-up. Six cases failed in decannulation. The decannulation rate was 90.5%.
SLNs were identified in 41 of 45 patients with 51 necks, SLNs had occult metastases in 13 cases, 15 necks with SLN-positive of these 13 cases, there was one false negative case, they were found in non-SLNs of neck specimens. Each neck side was considered a single case. SLN identification rate was 92.7%, sensitivity was 93.7%, false-negative rate was 6.3%, and accuracy was 98.0%. In 11 (73.3%) of these SLN-positive necks, the SLN with the highest counts contained tumor; harvesting the first-three nodes with the highest radioactive counts, which could all patients with occult metastatic disease.
Fifty two (86.7%)cases developed speech with voice and swallow rehabilitation, but 1 case of them suffered water drip from his tracheoesophageal shunt when drinking. The other 8 (11.3%) cases developed swallow rehabilitation but failed in speech rehabilitation for pharyngeal fistula (4 cases, in which 1 had pre-operative radiation therapy), tracheoesophageal shunt obstruction (2 cases), dyspnea with unknown reason (1 cases), no desire to speech (1 cases). Furthermore, all the 20 cases who were involved in post-operative radiative therapy restore their speech and swallow capability finally.
All the cases of chylous leakage happened 2nd to 5th days after the operation. Among the 39 cases, 7 were high flow (drainage&gt;or=500 ml/d) chylous leakage, the amount of drainage reached as high as 1440 ml per day. The time of chylous leakage closure was 3 approximately 12 days, and the mean time was 7 days. No one experienced re-operation, wound hydrops or wound infection.
The behavior science scores, concentration of eotaxin in nasal lavage, IgE in blood serum and concentration of CO in plasma of sensitized group were higher than those of control (P&lt;0.01), and the expression of HO-1 in nasal mucosa was also higher than control [(7.61+/-2.80)x10(-3) vs (2.32+/-1.14)x10(-3), P&lt;0.05]. All these items were higher when treated with Hemin and lower when treated with ZnPP (P&lt;0.05). The concentration of H2S in plasma was lower than control with significant differences [(14.80+/-1.60) micromol/L vs (18.90+/-1.00) micromol/L, P&lt;0.01], the expression of CSE was also lower than control (P&lt;0.05), and both of them were lower with Hemin induced and higher with ZnPP (P&lt;0.05). The expression of CBS was very low and had no significant differences between groups (P&gt;0.05), so it indicated that the CSE was the key enzyme for endogenous H2S product in nasal mucosa. Moreover the concentration of H2S was negatively correlated with CO (r=-0.702, P&lt;0.001).
Ang-1/Ang-2 protein expression ratio were significantly lower in OSCC than that in adjacent noncancerous oral tissues and normal oral mucosa (t were -5.42 and -6.234, all P&lt;0.01). There were significantly different Ang-1/Ang-2 protein expression ratio in different tumor' lymph node metastasis status and MVD groups and VMI groups, respectively (t were 3.421, -3.221, 3.824, all P&lt;0.01). The patients with low Ang-1/Ang-2 protein expression ratio and high VEGF protein expression were found to have a significantly higher MVD when compared to others (t were 2.055, 2.345, 2.985, all P&lt;0.05). Ang-1/Ang-2 protein expression ratio had a tendency to be a prognostic factor (chi2=3.383, P=0.066).
The tumor weight was (352+/-38) mg, (683+/-53) mg and (675+/-45) mg in SRL, FK506 and control group respectively. The tumor weight was significantly decreased in SRL group (P &lt; 0.01), and there was no difference between FK506 group and control group. The expression of VEGF and PCNA protein was remarkably down-regulated in SRL group compared to control group (P &lt; 0.05), and it was not significantly different between FK506 group and control group (P &gt; 0.05). Compared to the control group, MVD was significanly decreased in SRL group, and the apoptosis index of tumor cell was significantly higher in SRL group (P &lt; 0.01).
The portal vein catheterization was successful in all the patients. The stents were successfully implanted by transhepatic portal vein approach, and portal vein stenosis was re-opened. There was no abdominal hemorrhage in all the patients, but there were symptoms of abdominalgia, fever, nausea, vomiting and flatulence of varying degrees after interventional operation, and these symptoms were relieved by symptomatic treatment in one week. All patients in group A completed the treatment. I-II degree gastrointestinal tract reactions occurred in 3 cases, I-II degree myelosuppression occurred in 2 cases, and they were all completely relieved after treatment. The stent patency rate at 4, 6 and 12 months was 90%, 70%, 30% in group A; and 50%, 25% , 16.7% in group B (P &lt; 0.05). The survival rate at 3, 6 and 12 months was 100%, 80% , 30% in group A and 91.7%, 41.7%, 16.7% in group B (P &lt; 0.05).
The OPN mRNA and proteins levels were decreased by 75% and 80% in OPN siRNA treated cells. Colony formation and migratory capability were reduced in OPN siRNA treated cells (P &lt; 0.05).
Patients with HCV were associated with older age, lower mean preoperative platelet counts and albumin levels, higher mean prothrombin time, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin levels. Tumors in patients with HCV are multinodular and less differentiated, and were associated with a higher incidence of vascular invasion and cirrhosis. During the follow-up, the HCV group showed a higher incidence of intrahepatic recurrence and multiple recurrent lesions than the other patients.
Of the 32 patients in preventive group, the amount of HBV DNA was detected in the 1rst, 3rd, 6th and 12th month after nucleos(t)ide analogues treatment. After chemotherapy or immunosuppressant treatment, only 9.4% (3/32) of them suffered from HBV reactivation, as indicated by positive HBV DNA in the serum and abnormal liver function. Ot the 77 patients in control group without nucleos(t)ide analogues treatment before chemotherapy or immunosuppression therapy, 58.4% (45/77) shown HBV reactivation, 4 patients in the control group died of liver failure, and one liver failure patient recieved liver transplantation.
Subjects with both BCP and precore mutations had significantly higher HBV DNA levels than those without mutations [(4.9+/-1.4) vs (4.1+/-1.1) log(10)copies/ml, t = 2.308, P &lt; 0.05]. A higher proportion of patients with histological activity index (HAI) &gt; or = to 4 was found in patients with both mutations (32.1% vs 16.7%) than in patients without mutation, however, the proportion of patients with histological activity index (HAI) &gt; or = to 3 in patients with mutations was not significantly different from that in patients without mutations (14.3% vs. 12.5%, x(2)=0.000, P &gt; 0.05). In patients without precore or BCP mutations, there was a strong positive correlation between viral load and liver inflammation as well as fibrosis (precore: r=0.626, 0.592, P &lt; 0.01; BCP: r=0.730, 0.641, P &lt; 0.01). In patients without both mutations, HBV DNA has shown a high accuracy for predecting fibrosis (F &gt; or = 3) (AUC = 0.905, 95% CI: 0.771-1.039, P &lt; 0.05) with the cutoff value of 4.5 log(10) copies/ml (sensitivity = 1.000, specificity = 0.778, PPV = 42.9%, NPV = 100.0%). Results of both genotypes and mutations were successfully obtained in 40 samples with HBV DNA is &gt; or = to 10(4) copies/ml. The higher viral load was observed in the patients with genotype B than genotype C (5.1 vs 4.3 log(10)copies/ml, t = 2.059, P &lt; 0.05), but no difference was seen of liver pathologic changes between these two genotypes.
ALT normalization rates at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th month of the treatment group (69.5%, 85.9%, 90.5%, 82.7%) were higher than those in the control group (50.3%, 65.4%, 78.4%, 69.7%; P &lt; 0.01). HBeAg seroconversion rate, rate of HBV DNA undetectable, and YMDD mutation rate at he 12th and18th month are 77.7%, 57.7%, 25.5%, 6.8%; 86.8%, 74.1%, 33.2%, 8.6% in the treatment group, and 54.6%, 36.8%, 13.0%, 14.6%; 69.2%, 37.3%, 19.5%, 20.5% in the control group (P &lt; 0.01, or P &lt; 0.05).
Of 56 cases, 39 cases were mild hepatitis, 10 were moderate hepatitis, and 7 were severe hepatitis. The morphology of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was similar to that of fibroblasts in the tissues of the patients with chronic hepatitis B. Collagenous fibers were deposited around the hepatic stellate cells. Electron-dense materials were deposited between sinusoidal endothelial cell and hepatic stellate cell. The size and amount of fenestraes of sinusoidal endothelial cells were reduced in 53 of 56 cases. The consecutive or inconsecutive membrane-like materials were observed along sinusoidal endothelial cells in 20 cases. Collagen fibers were observed in the space of Disse in 15 cases. Even in the patients with normal hepatic functions, red blood cells aggregation and microthrombi could be observed in the liver tissues.
HE staining indicated that collagen fibers were reduced in the TGFbeta3 group. Masson staining shown that the collagen fibers were distributed around the blood vessel, in the portal area and disse space. Compared to the model group (13.2%+/-2.2%) and negative control group (12.3%+/-1.5%), the collagen fibers in liver tissues of TGFbeta3 group (7.7%+/-1.5%) were significantly decreased (q = 9.456, P &lt; 0.01; q = 8.217, P &lt; 0.01). Histochemistry indicated that the collagen fibers of liver tissues of TGFbeta3 group (0.185+/-0.033) were significantly higher than those in the model group (0.252+/-0.042) and the negative control group (0.230+/-0.029), (q = 6.228, P &lt; 0.01; q = 4.346, P &lt; 0.01).
Danshensu inhibited the proliferation of HSCs in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 0.0625 to 0.25 mmol/L, Danshensu significantly repressed the proliferation of HSC induced by IL-1beta (P &lt; 0.05). Synthesis and secretion of Type I collagen was significantly decreased 24 hours after 0.25 mmol/L Danshensu treatment (P &lt; 0.01). The phosphorylation of JNK induced by IL-1beta was significantly inhibited by Danshensu treatment (P &lt; 0.05), however, the expression of JNK was not regulated by Danshensu.
Among the 43 off-springs, 3 were positive for tail tissue PEG10 gene examination, PEG10 was successfully expressed in the liver of the randomly selected transgenic mouse. H22 tumor grew faster in all the transgenic mice than in wild type mice. The average size and weight of tumors between the transgenic mice and wild type mice were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05). Most tumors in the transgenic mice invaded the surrounding tissues and showed liver metastasis, PEG10 protein was expressed in liver. In contrast, nearly all the tumors in wild type mice were capsulized and PEG10 was not expressed in liver.
Birth weight less than 1,000 g was associated with a strongly increased risk of hepatoblastoma (odds risk, OR = 26.0, 95% confidence interval, CI: 14.0 to 65.7). After adjustment of birth weight, a moderately increased risk of hepatoblastoma was found for older maternal age ( &gt; 35 years vs. 20 to 34 years: OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 0.9 to 5.9), maternal smoking (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1 to 4.2) and higher maternal pregnancy body mass index (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 6.7).
The expression of ICAM-1 protein in the tensile stress group (1.16+/-0.07) or the compressive stress group (1.05+/-0.02) were significantly higher than that of the control group (0.78+/-0.07, F=3.31, P&lt;0.05), and the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA in the tensile stress group (1.42+/-0.05) or the compressive stress group (1.27+/-0.05) were also significantly higher than that of the control group (0.13+/-0.04, F=23.1, P&lt;0.01). After pretreated with PD98059 for 60 min, the expression of ICAM-1 protein in the tensile stress group (1.62+/-0.10) was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.50+/-0.03, q=3.75, P&lt;0.05), while there was no significant difference between the compressive stress group (0.60+/-0.03, q=0.32, P&gt;0.05) and the control group. At the transcription level, the expression of ICAM-1 in the tensile stress group (1.57+/-0.03) was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.35+/-0.29, q=3.51, P&lt;0.05), while there was no significant difference between the compressive stress group (0.46+/-0.03, q=0.32, P&gt;0.05) and the control group.
The Pdimax in the 18 h CMV group and the 24 h CMV group [(8.98+/-0.55, 6.12+/-0.53) cm H2O, 1 cm H2O=0.098 kPa] was significantly reduced (F=82.35, P&lt;0.01) compared with the control group [(14.92+/-0.16) cm H2O]. The Fc and the H/L decreased significantly. At the stimulation frequency of 100 Hz, the diaphragm muscle force in the 18 h CMV group and 24 h CMV group [(84.11+/-0.43) N, (52.65+/-0.64) N, respectively] decreased compare with the control [(98.13+/-0.50) N, F=15.02, P&lt;0.01]. The proportion of MHC2A decreased in the 24 h group compared with control. The ultrastructural changes of the diaphragm was observed in the 24 h CMV group, such as disrupted myofibrils, increased numbers of lipid vacuoles in the sarcoplasm, and abnormally small mitochondria containing focal membrane disruptions.
There was no statistical difference in the blood gas before the use of non-invasive ventilator, 2 h and 1 d after the use of non-invasive ventilator, and before discharge, PaCO2 [(36+/-10), (42+/-11), (41+/-10), (42+/-11) mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa)], PaO2 [(84+/-11), (81+/-12), (87+/-14), (86+/-12) mm Hg], SaO2 [(96.7+/-1.3)%, (96.5+/-0.8)%, (96.8+/-1.2)%, (96.5+/-1.0)%] respectively, (F=1.21, 0.59, 0.97, 0.41, respectively, all P&gt;0.05). All patients had no complaint of uncomfortable use, no intolerance to ventilators, and no ventilator breakdown. Fifteen patients were alive at the end of the follow-up (July 31, 2008). The mean time of using non-invasive ventilator was 39 months (range 4 to 66 months).
Immunohistochemistry and FQ-PCR showed that COX-2 (2.8+/-0.8) and TLR4 (2.1+/-0.7) were detected in the respiratory tract of the normal control rats. In Group L, the expression of COX-2 (6.5+/-2.8) and TLR4 (44.9+/-11.3) was increased in the main bronchus and bronchioles, compared to the normal controls (t=3.003, 10.480, both P&lt;0.01). In Group Zb, the expression of COX-2 (5.0+/-2.0) and TLR4 (16.2+/-3.8) were decreased as compared to Group L, but only the level of TLR4 showed statistical difference (t=7.030, P&lt;0.001).
The patient was a 60-year-old male. The primary manifestations were subcutaneous nodules. The reason for his hospitalization was pleural effusion. Orbital tumor was present. Computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen reveal systemic lymphadenopathy. Lymphoma was proved by pathological study.
APE was identified in 169 of the 570 cases. Kappa analysis for the 3 scoring systems revealed a low level of agreement: 0.269-0.374, P&lt;0.05. The result of the Geneva score was consistent with that of the revised Geneva score, between them there was an excellent correlation. The positive predictive values of Wells, Geneva, revised Geneva scores for APE were 83.8%, 53.3%, and 61.3% respectively, while the negative predictive values were 85.0%, 80.6%, and 80.0%, respectively. ROC analysis showed that the area under curve (AUC) of Wells, Geneva and revised Geneva score for APE was 0.823 (95% CI: 0.710-0.976), 0.677 (95% CI: 0.646-0.990), and 0.661 (95% CI: 0.631-0.983), respectively. The Wells score showed the best discriminatory ability as compared to the other 2 scores.
The most accurate (70.6%) cutoff value was HRCT score of 20%. In 83 IIP patients 51 cases were treated with corticosteroid. These patients were divided into 2 groups by the HRCT score: HRCT score&gt;or=20% group (n=25) and HRCT score&lt;20% group (n=26). The mortality in hospital was 40.0% in HRCT score&gt;or=20% group and 3.8% in HRCT score&lt;20% group, chi2=9.848, P&lt;0.01. The percentage of effective treatment with corticosteroid was 8.0% in HRCT score&gt;or=20% group and 50.0% in HRCT score&lt;20% group, chi2=10.829, P&lt;0.01. The duration of hospitalization was 3.0 (1.0-6.5) and 1.2 (0.7-2.0) months in HRCT score&gt;or=20% group and &lt;20% group, z=-2.758, P&lt;0.01. The course of IIP before using corticosteroid was 24.0 (4.0-48.0) and 2.0 (1.0-12.0) months in HRCT score&gt;or=20% group and &lt;20% group, z=-2.900, P&lt;0.01. Pathologic pattern was identified in 15 cases in the 2 groups: 4 UIP cases in group HRCT score&gt;or=20%; 1 AIP case, 1 UIP case and 9 NSIP cases in group HRCT score&lt;20%.
CSE induced ECV-304 cell apoptosis and COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis rate of ECV-304 cells with 5.0% CSE was the highest (5.40+/-0.39)%. CSE- induced COX-2 expression reached the highest level with 5.0% CSE (206.1+/-15.5), the differences being significant (F=90.03, 159.94, all P&lt;0.05). Furthermore CSE induced both apoptosis rate and COX-2 expression time-dependently, with the apoptosis rate achieving the peak after 24 h (8.87+/-0.41)%, while COX-2 expression reached the highest level at 9 h. The selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib inhibited COX-2 protein expression partially and augmented cell apoptosis induced by CSE.

2002 specimens, 1243 specimens of secretion (62.1%), 600 blood specimens (30.0%), 102 specimens of pus or secretion of respiratory tract (5.1%), 45 specimens from catheter (2.2%), and 12 urine specimens (0.5%). Pathogens were found in 725 cases. The top five pathogenic bacteria isolated within 1 month after the quake were Acinetobacter baumannii (16.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (16.7%), Escherichia coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Candida tropicalis (8.3%), quite different from the pathogen spectrum of the common in-patients within one month before the quake: Escherichia coli (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%), Candida glabrata (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%). The isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus after the earthquake was significantly lower, and the isolation rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were all significantly higher than those from the common surgical patients before the quake (all P &lt; 0.05). There were not significant differences in the isolation rates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Acinetobacter baumannii before and after the quake.
Five different patterns (A-E) were found among the 11 MRSA strains. The 5 strains isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake included subtype A (n = 1), subtype B (n = 2), subtype C (n = 1), and subtype E (n = 1). And the 6 stains isolated from the patient that come from non-earthquake-stricken areas included A (n = 3), subtype B (n = 1), subtype C (n = 1), and subtype D (n = 1).
Ninety-six stains were isolated, 79.86% of them were from the infected wound secretion and 58.33% were from three department of orthopedics. The bacteria with high isolation rates included Acinetobacter spp. (20 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (17 strains), and Staphylococcus spp. (13 strains). The isolated Gram negative bacteria showed lower resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam.
(1) The behavioral results showed that the reaction time to the unrelated character stimuli in the ADHD children was (1252 +/- 256) ms, significantly longer than that in the normal control [(1131 +/- 194) ms, P &lt; 0.05].

The omentin mRNA level in omental adipose tissue of the NGR-NW group was (1.52 +/- 0.32), significantly higher than that in subcutaneous adipose tissue [(0.019 +/- 0.006), P &lt; 0.01]. The omentin mRNA level of the males was (1.46 +/- 0.31), not statistically different from that of the female [(1.58 +/- 0.29), P = 0.416]. The omentin mRNA level of the NGR-OW/OB group was (1.18 +/- 0.29), significantly lower than that of the NGR-NW group [(1.52 +/- 0.32), P &lt; 0.05], and the omentin mRNA level of the T2DM-OW/OB group was (0.98 +/- 0.37), both significantly lower than those of the other 2 groups (both P &lt; 0.05). Partial correlation analysis showed that the omentin mRNA was negatively correlated with HOMA-IR, body weight, WHR, triglyceride, BMI, and fasting insulin, and positively correlated to serum omentin level and HDL-C. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that serum omentin level, HOMA-IR, and body weight were independent variables of omentin.
The prevalence of MS increased along with age. The MS prevalence rates of the subjects with FPG &gt; or = 5.6 mmol/L in the age groups 25 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54, and &gt; or = 55 were 23.5%, 37.2%, 45.7%, and 53.0% respectively, all significantly higher than those of the subjects with the FPG &lt; 5.6 mmol/L (2.2%, 4.7%, 7.8%, and 9.5% respectively, all P &lt; 0.01).

Patients were followed up for 3 - 60 months. The total effective rate of the 155 patients was 44.5%. The effective rate of the patients with light perception or better vision was 87.5%, much higher than that of the patients without light perception (29.6%). Eyesight was improved, mostly occurring 1 - 5 days after operation and lasting for 1 - 3 months, in 69 patients. Residual vision degree after trauma (OR = 0.04) and the interval between injury and surgery (OR = 4.62) were significant prognostic factors of the general effect (P &lt; 0.01), and the gradual or immediate visual loss history (OR = 0.22) and the interval between injury and surgery (OR = 6.34) were significant to the outcomes of the patients with no light perception (P &lt; 0.05). Sex, age, duration of coma after trauma, pre- and post-operative duration of steroid treatment, operators, fracture site of optic canal, and nerve sheath incision were not correlated to the outcomes of patients (all P &gt; 0.05). Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and postoperative transient visual loss occurred in one and the other two cases, respectively, but these conditions were resolved successfully.

There were not significant differences in the TbetaR-I and TbetaR-II levels in the HSC culture fluid treated by 50 mg/L BMP-7. 96 h after the treatment of 50 mg/L BMP-7 the Smad2/3 immunofluorescent strength in the HSC and hepatocytes decreased remarkably, and the TGF-beta1 level in the HSC decreased to the level 88% as high as that before treatment.
PCR showed 1131 bp fragment in the T47D-tk genome, but not in the T47D genome. The numbers of growing T47D cells on days 3, and 7 were (10.00 +/- 1.30) x 10(3) and (19.25 +/- 0.66) x 10(3) respectively, not significantly different from those of the T47D-tk cells [(10.25 +/- 0.90) x 10(3) and (19.00 +/- 1.80) x 10(3) respectively, both P &gt; 0.05]. The time needed for tumor formation after the inoculation of T47D cells was (9.67 +/- 0.33) d, not significantly different from that of the T47D-tk cells [(9.83 +/- 0.48) d, P &gt; 0.05]. The tumor size 19 days after inoculation of the T47D cells was (72.17 +/- 25.88) mm(3), not significantly different from that of the T47D-tk cells [(70.66 +/- 22.16) mm(3), P &gt; 0.05].
Sixty-seven of the 253 CI recipients (26.5%) were found to have GJB2 mutations. One novel mutation, GJB2 235delC/598G &gt; A, was identified. The detection rates of GJB2 mutations in the CI recipients were significantly higher than those among the controls (all P &lt; 0.05). The postoperative outcomes of CI in both the GJB2 gene mutation positive and negative groups were very good, however, without significant differences among these 2 groups (all P &gt; 0.05).
12 articles on the first question were selected, including one RCT, five cohort studies, six case-control studies. Six RCTs on the second question were selected. Because of clinical heterogeneity among the researches thus retrieved, meta-analysis was not conducted, and qualitative analysis showed that initial LD dose, LD dose per kilogram body weight, accumulated LD dose, and accumulated LD equivalent dose might be independent factors associated with motor complications. The time from disease onset to initiation of LD was not correlated with motor complications. DA as initial treatment was associated with later occurrence of dyskinesias (CALM-PD: HR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25 - 0.56, P &lt; 0.001; PELMOPET: HR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.29 - 0.80, P &lt; 0.001; Ropinirole 056: HR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 - 0.8, P = 0.007; REAL-PET: HR = 8.28, 95% CI: 2.46 - 27.93, P &lt; 0.001). The relationship between LD treatment duration and motor complications could not be concluded from present evidence.
There was no significant differences in the latency of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) between the anesthesia status TOF(4) and anesthesia status TOF(2) in FF, APB, and ADM (all P &gt; 0.05). The amplitude of CMAP deceased gradually as the degree of neuromuscular blockade increased in FF, APB, and ADM (all P &lt; 0.05). CMAP could not be recorded when the value of TOF was 0 (P &lt; 0.01).
Anesthesia took effect about 4 minutes after injection in these 4 groups without significant differences among then (all P &gt; 0.05). The good analgesic effect rates of Groups A, B, and C were all 100%, all significantly higher than that of Group D (87.5%, P = 0.027). The block maintenance times of Groups A, B, and C were (377 +/- 111) min, (369 +/- 135) min, and (351 +/- 112) min respectively, all significantly longer than that of Group D [(296 +/- 101) min, P = 0.024]. No anesthesia-related complication was found in these 4 groups.
Multivariate logistic regression showed that the preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) and clarity of cornea were independent risk factors for final outcome (OR(IOP) = 1.408, P = 0.047, and OR(CLA) = 1.691, P = 0.019). Cox regression showed that clarity of cornea was the factor related to the surgery success time (OR(CLA) = 1.632, P = 0.008).
(1) Compared with baseline levels, the levels of Hb, Hct, SF, and TSAT significantly increased 2 weeks after treatment in the intravenous iron sucrose group, and 4 weeks after treatment in the oral medication group (all P &lt; 0.05).

(5) The mean EPO doses 6, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment of the intravenous iron sucrose group were significantly lower than that before treatment and those of the oral medication group (all P &lt; 0.05). (6) The Hb, Hct, SF, and TSAT levels maintained stable during the period 6, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment in the intravenous iron sucrose group despite the decrease in dose and frequency. (7) The Hb, Hct, SF, and TSAT levels were significantly higher in the intravenous PD subgroup than in the intravenous HD subgroup. (8) No adverse event was found in the intravenous iron sucrose group, and adverse gastrointestinal effects occurred in 12 patients of the oral medication group. (9) After 12 weeks, the cost of EPO + intravenous iron sucrose was significantly higher than that of EPO + ferrous succinate.
The common clinical symptoms of these 8 patients included abdominal distention and ascites. Pre-operationally, 6 cases were diagnosed as with ovarian cancer, I case as with malignant mesothelioma, and I as with peritoneal carcinoma. The misdiagnosis rate was 87.5%. Post-operational pathological examination showed 7 cases of serous papillary adenocarcinoma and one case of mucinous adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry showed the positive rates of the different biological markers as follows: pan-CK (8/8), CK7 (8/8), CK20 (1/8), CA125 (7/8), CEA (7/8), EMA (8/8), vimentin (1/8), calretinin (1/8), and P53 (8/8).
The mRNA expression index of MyoD of the MD patients was (0.267 +/- 0.114), significantly lower than that of the healthy controls [(0.788 +/- 0.136), P = 0.001].
The serum MIF, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels of the DM, DPN, and DPNP groups were all significantly higher than those of the control group (P &lt; 0. 001, P &lt; 0.05). The serum MIF and TNF-alpha levels of the DPN and DPNP groups were all significantly higher than those of the DM group (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.001), while there were not significant differences in the serum MIF and TNF-alpha levels between the DPN and DPNP groups (both P &gt; 0.05). There was not significant difference in the serum IL-6 level among the DM, DPN, and DPNP groups as well (all P &gt; 0.05). The correlation analysis show that the levels of MIF, TNF-alpha and IL-6 each other were positively correlated (r = 0.337, P &lt; 0.01; r = 0.216, P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.281, P &lt; 0.05).
Twenty-six of the 55 specimens (47.3%) were positive in CaG, and 23 of the 35 tumors with the Gleason score &gt;or= 7 was 66%, significantly higher than those of the lower-grade tumors (all P &lt; 0.01). Most of the high-grade tumors showed small cluster pattern, and most of the low-grade tumors showed solitary scattered pattern. The numbers of NED cells in the stage III and IV tumors were 67% and 71.4% respectively, both significantly higher than that of the stage II tumors (25%, both P &lt; 0.05), There was no correlation between the NE positive cell rate and preoperative PSA value (P &gt; 0.05). Thirty cases progressed to a hormone-independent status within 18 (5 - 79) months (Group A), and the rest 25 cases remained not progressing within 31 (17 - 85) months (Group B). The NED rate of Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (P &lt; 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that NE positivity, Gleason &gt;or= 7, stage IV, and bone metastasis were influential factors of clinical progression. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that NED and pre-operational PSA value were independent prognostic factors of bone metastasis.
Out of the 5 patients receiving allografting, 3 gained bone union with an external fixator index of (2.22 +/- 0.84) months/cm, 2 developed nonunion and subsequently gained union after receiving cancellous bone autografting, and no infection recurrence all of the 5 patients were found. Out of the 14 patients (15 sites) undergoing autografting, 2 patients (2 sites, 13.3%) developed nonunion due to recurrent infection resulting in absorption of autograft, subsequently received debridement and autografting once again, and gained bone union and infection eradication; 12 patients (13 sites, 86.7%) gained bone union with an external fixator index: of (1.96 +/- 0.74) months/cm. Re-fracture occurred in 3 patients (4 sites) and was cured by using cast immobilization (1 case), external fixator (1 case), or internal fixation (1 case).
An anti-sense cDNA library was constructed containing 2 x 10(6) independent clones with an insert efficiency of more than 90%; DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis suggested that the No.27 survival clone was zinc transporter LIV1 showing a strong resistance against trichostatin A-induced apoptosis during functional screening.
The tumor volume of the SKMES1(PEDFexp) group was (0.10 +/- 0.05) cm(3), significantly smaller than that of the control group [(0.17 +/- 0.07) cm(3), P = 0.016], and the mass of the SKME(SPEDFexp) group was (0.008 +/- 0.004) mg, significantly smaller than that of the control group too [(0.024 +/- 0.009) mg, P = 0.006].

The mRNA and protein expression levels of Jagged1 and Jagged2 in the 1, 25 (OH)(2)D(3)-treated DCs were (0.376 +/- 0.029) and (0.786 +/- 0.034), and (0.564 +/- 0.018) and (0.632 +/- 0.026) respectively, all significantly higher than those of the control group [(0.146 +/- 0.032) and (0.124 +/- 0.025), and (0.267 +/- 0.012) and (0.098 +/- 0.012) respectively, all P &lt; 0.01)]. The percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in the CD4+ T cells cultured with 1, 25 (OH)(2)D(3)-treated DCs was (22.49% +/- 0.56%), significantly higher than that of the a PBS control group [(6.67% +/- 0.60%), P &lt; 0.01]. The percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in CD4+ T cells after cultured with 1, 25 (OH)(2)D(3)-treated DC blocked by polyclonal antibody of Jagged2 was (6.56% +/- 1.89%), significantly lower than that of the un-blocked control group [(20.37% +/- 1.64%), P &lt; 0.01]. The levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-gamma, and eosinophil count in the BALF of the 1, 25 (OH)(2)D(3)-treated DC group were (33 +/- 5) pg/ml, (134 +/- 23) pg/ml, (91 +/- 11) pg/ml, and undetectable (&lt; 12.5 pg/ml), and (236 +/- 29) x 10(3)/ml, all significantly lower than those of the PBS-DC group [(55 +/- 7) pg/ml, (332 +/- 49) pg/ml, (152 +/- 19) pg/ml, and (23 +/- 6) pg/ml, and (588 +/- 56) x 10(3)/ml, all P &lt; 0.01]. The percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in the spleens of the 1, 25 (OH)(2)D(3)-treated DC group was (14.69% +/- 1.14%), significantly higher than that of the PBS-treated DC group [(2.38% +/- 0.14%, P &lt; 0.01).
The IFN-gamma level in the culture fluid of the T-bet gene modified DCs was (15.24 +/- 4.75) ng/ml, significantly higher than that of the LacZ gene modified DCs and control DCs [(3.08 +/- 0.61) and (2.35 +/- 0.41) ng/ml respectively, both P &lt; 0.01]. The IFN-gamma in mice blood plasma of T-bet groups in abrogating and reversing trial were (130.2 +/- 10.5) and (145.7 +/- 16.7) pg/ml respectively, both significantly higher than those of the abrogating and reversing trial normal control groups [(25.0 +/- 6.5) and (24.6 +/- 5.9) pg/ml respectively], asthmatic model control groups [(20.7 +/- 4.5) and (16.5 +/- 7.0) pg/ml respectively] and LacZ groups [(17.6 +/- 7.0) and (24.2 +/- 9.0) pg/ml respectively] (all P &lt; 0.01). However, the IL-4 levels in mice blood plasma of T-bet groups were both significantly lower than those of asthmatic model control groups and LacZ groups (all P &lt; 0.01). The airway inflammation of T-bet groups were remarkable milder than those of the model control groups and LacZ groups.
All patients had the symptom of asthma. As in other case series, the lung, peripheral nervous system, and skin were the most commonly involved organs. During the active stage of the disease, most of the patients exhibited peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum total IgE level. Two patients were treated with pulse treatment of methylprednisolone followed by prednisone with tapering dose and cyclophosphamide, nine patients were treated with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and the others were treated with corticosteroids alone. Several patients were treated with the following drugs in combination: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, ciclosporin, common Threewingnut root, and intravenous injection of IgG. Symptom relief was seen in all patients after treatment. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Seven patients showed sustained remission, of which 3 had discontinued the medication, 3 were treated with low-dose corticosteroids and immunity inhibitors, and 1 continued to be treated with low-dose corticosteroids. Six patients suffered from relapse 1.7 times due to withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment or tapering of corticosteroid dose and they regained remission once more after increasing the corticosteroid dose and combination of cyclophosphamide. Four of these 6 patients were treated with corticosteroids of low or medium dose as maintenance doses, and the other 2 with medium-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. One patient committed suicide because of family dissension 1 year after treatment.
Among 360 asthmatic patients, 325 (90.3%) enjoyed various kinds of social insurance. During the past year, 12.2% (44/360) of them were in hospital because of asthma exacerbation, 25.6% (92/360) of them had visited emergency department because of asthma exacerbation; the percentage of adults with lost workdays caused by asthma was 29.6% (65/220), and the percentage of children with lost school days was 26.9% (7/26); 87.8% (316/360) of the respondents had undergone a lung-function test, 29.2% (105/360) had ever used peak flow meter; 68.6% (247/360) of these patients had been used inhaled corticosteroids regularly for a long time, and 30.6% (110/360) of them achieved asthma control.
Sphk1 protein was localized primarily in the nuclei of the fibroblasts, and Sphk2 protein was detected both in the cytoplasm and nuclei in the 3 groups. The mRNA and protein levels of Sphk1 in the keloid group were (0.0608 +/- 0.0190) and (0.8308 +/- 0.1093) respectively, both significantly higher than those of the normal skin group [(0.0383 +/- 0.0147) and (0.6800 +/- 0.1126) respectively, both P &lt; 0.05], but significantly lower than those of the keloid fibroblasts with TGF-beta1 group [(0.0790 +/- 0.0280), P &lt; 0.05, and (1.4267 +/- 0.1938), P &lt; 0.01]. There was no significant differences in the Sphk2 mRNA and protein levels among these 3 groups (all P &gt; 0.05).
Twenty of the 47 patients showed abnormal images by chest HRCT and 17 of the 20 patients were suspected to be with aGVHD-induced lung injury. The HRCT images were characterized by diffused interstitial infiltrate in 5 cases, diffused interstitial and alveolar infiltrate in 7 cases, and diffused interstitial and segmental lobar alveolar infiltrate in 5 cases. Nine cases had bilateral pleural effusion and hydropericardium, including 4 cases accompanied by myocardial hypertrophy. The levels of serum IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha of the patients with lung injury were (6.9 +/- 1.8) microg/L and (400 +/- 102) microg/L respectively, both not significantly different from those of the patients without lung injury [(6.3 +/- 1.2) microg/L and (428 +/- 83) microg/L respectively, P = 0.202, 0.306]. The histopathology of the lung tissue was characterized by disorganization, epithelial cell damage, interstitial fibroplasia, and interstitial T lymphocyte or macrophage infiltrate. The effective rate of treatment for aGVHD-induced lung injury was positively correlated with that for aGVHD (r = 0.771, P = 0.01). Eleven of the 24 patients who survived more than 6 months had abnormal pulmonary function, including 7 out of the 9 patients with aGVHD-induced lung injury and 4 out the 15 patients without aGVHD-induced lung injury. There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal pulmonary function between the patients with and without lung injury (P = 0.033).
The expression of CD2AP in the MCRCC specimens was stronger than that in the CCRCC that was in turn stronger than that than that in the simple renal cyst (SRC) specimens. The epithelium lining the cysts in MCRCC was strongly positive in CD2AP compared to other parts. CCRCC showed a weak expression of CD2AP, while CD2AP was negative in the SRC specimens. The staining intensity and location of expression were completely identical for nephrin and CD2AP among the three types of tissue specimens.
The aneuploidy rates of chromosomes 7 and 17 were 48.5% (32/66) and 50.0% (33/66) respectively, and the co-aneuploidy rate of chromosomes 7 and 17 was 25.8% (17/66). In the patients with G(2/3) superficial bladder cancer, the aneuploidy rate of chromosomes 17 of those with recurrence was 64.3%, significantly higher than that of patients without recurrence (22.2%, P &lt; 0.05). However, there were not significant differences in the aneuploidy rates of chromosomes 7 and 17 in the pT(a) and pT(1) superficial bladder cancer patients with or without recurrence (all P &gt; 0.05), however, the co-aneuploidy rate of chromosomes 7 and 17 of the patients with recurrence was 47.8%, significantly higher than that of the patients without recurrence (12.5%, P &lt; 0.05). Fourteen of the 42 patients with recurrence showed progression, i.e., with increased grade or stage (&gt;/= pT(2)). The aneuploidy rates of chromosomes 7 and 17 of these 14 patients were 78.6% and 92.9% respectively, both significantly higher than those of the 28 patients without progression (42.9% and 46.4% respectively, both P &lt; 0.05).
Operation was performed successful on all 7 patients. The mean operative time was 20 min, the mean estimated operative blood loss was 5 ml, and the mean hospital stay was 3 d. Follow-up was conduced for 28.3 months (8 months-10 years). All patients were free of symptoms after surgery, without recurrence and complications that needed further therapy. Two of the 3 patients with infertility succeeded in fertilization 1 year after surgery, and 1 patient with retrograde ejaculation underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection and succeeded in fertilization 6 months after operation.
Fluorescence microscopy showed that the transfection rate of siRNA was over 90%. MTT method showed that 24 h and 36 h after transfection the A value and survival rate of the SMMC7721 cells of the experimental group were both significantly higher than those of the control d normal groups (all P &lt; 0.05). Western blotting showed that the expression levels of DNMT3b and cyclin D1 of the experimental group decreased significantly compared with the control and the normal groups. MSP showed no obvious change of the state of methylation among the 3 groups.
(1) Under the pressures of 40, 60, and 80 mm Hg, the abdominal electrical activity frequencies of external oblique muscle responding to CRD in SD Group were (220 +/- 94), (313 +/- 162), and (493 +/- 279) times respectively, all significantly lower than those in YC Group [(506 +/- 223), (1053 +/- 548), and (1632 +/- 249) times respectively, all P &lt; 0.05], and those of Rim Group were (668 +/- 257), (1144 +/- 93), and (1653 +/- 153) times respectively, all significantly higher than those of SD Group (all P &lt; 0.05), but not significantly different from those of YC Group. (2) The RNA and protein expression levels of CB1 receptor in the thalamus, brain stem, and spinal cord of SD Group were all significantly higher than those of YC Group (all P &lt; 0.05), while the RNA and protein expression levels of FAAH and MGL in the thalamus and spinal cord of SD Group were all significantly lower than those of YC Group (all P &lt; 0.05).
Clinical examination must remain mandatory for staging and evaluation. Measurements of tumor volume should also be mandatory. Magnetic resonance imaging provides the most accurate imaging measure of tumor volume. Identification of lymph node (LN) metastasis needs to remain a high priority. Promising data in FDG-PET warrants multicenter validation. Validated prognostic markers include tumor volume, uterine corpus extension, cervical lymph-vascular space invasion, extent of LN metastasis, current tobacco smoking, hemoglobin levels at time of diagnosis, and HPV-16 associated cancer. No 'high-technology' biomarkers are ready for validation in multicenter trials.
Two patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one patients (mean age was 49.8 years) were followed from 192 to 543 days (median = 292 days). Thirteen patients had single track, eight had multiple tracks and 14 had a recurrent fistula. Success, defined by closure of all fistula tracks occurred in 71.4% (15/21). The success rate was 84.6% in patients with a single fistula track (11/13) compared with 50% in patients with multiple tracks (4/8) (P = 0.14, Fisher's exact test). Recurrent [10/14 (71.4%)] vs nonrecurrent fistulae [5/7 (71.4%)] had no bearing on the outcome (P = 1.0). Two patients experienced healing despite extrusion of the plug in the early postoperative period. The procedure was safe and well tolerated.
The values of the VAS ranged from zero to 97.8 mm (mean: 48.9 +/- 32.9 mm). The HAQ scores ranged from zero to 2.75 (average: 0.95 +/- 0.8). The average BMI was 22.4 +/- 3.9 kg / m2. The average deficit of mass was: 1.3 +/- 2.1 kg. Ten patients had high nutritional risk. 1 patient was malnourished and 15 were at high risk for malnutrition. The average peak torque to the muscle groups of elbows was 19.2 +/- 5 N / m to the flexor and 21.9 +/-6.6 N/m for the extensors, with an average deficit of 17% and 13% for the both groups.
All animals tolerated the ferrofluid application without any clinical irregularities; there were no signs of thrombosis or embolism. Histological analysis revealed an accumulation in the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney depending on the particle size; the serological examination did not show significant alterations of the blood parameters.
Independent-sample t tests revealed that both Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNL) total mean scores were higher among sport participants vs nonsport participants (P &lt; 0.05). Significant correlation between CIQ and RNL total scores was found for all participants (Pearson correlation coefficients, P &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the unadjusted odds ratio of a high CIQ mean score was 4.75 (95% CI 1.7, 13.5) among current sport participants. Similarly, the unadjusted odds ratio of a high RNL score was 7.00 (95% CI 2.3, 21.0) among current sport participants. Regression-adjusted odds ratios of high CIQ and high RNL scores were 1.36 (95% CI 0.09, 1.45) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.04, 0.55), respectively. The odds ratio for pre-SCI sport participation predicting post-SCI sport participation was 3.06 (95% CI 1.23, 7.65).
Surgical intervention was carried out in 25 participants (19 men, 6 women), having a total of 39 ulcers (13 Stage III, 23 Stage IV, 3 unstaged). Surgeries performed were debridement (3), split skin grafting (13), and flap mobilization and closure (23). Only 4 participants (16.6%) had initial complications: wound dehiscence (2) and delayed graft healing (2). Follow-up rate was 92.0% (23/25 patients), with a duration of 12 to 21 months (mean, 15.4 +/- 7.45 months), and only 4 participants (17.3%) had ulcer recurrence. The majority of participants (13 of 25; 56.5%) improved neurologically on ASIA grade and functional evaluation on Barthel Index, suggesting statistically significant improvement (P &lt; 0.005).
Changes in clinical and electrophysiologic measurements in the cold group were statistically significant compared with those of the tizanidine and patient control groups.
EPT measurements from left and right sides, obtained from the 2 time points and 2 testers, were found to be strongly associated, with the exception of left and right side measurements at the S2 dermatome. No significant differences in the mean EPT for tester or time period were found. The intra- and inter-rater reliability was good for all dermatomes tested. Mean EPT measurements fell within the range of a normative template at each of the 4 dermatomes tested.
The 1- and 2-factor solutions fit the structure of the items accounting for 41% to 51% of original item variance. Congruence between random samples was uniformly high for the 1-factor solution (r = 0.791-0.948) but variable for the 2-factor solution. Although congruence was high for the combined sample and men (r = 0.90-0.97 and 0.71-0.94, respectively), it was variable for women (r = 0.29-0.85).
With the exception of subjects younger than 6 years, agreement on repeated total PP, LT, and TM scores were good to excellent, as shown by ICC values of 0.92 or higher. Although agreement was high for the youngest age group for LT (ICC = 0.920), PP (ICC = 0.957), and TM (ICC = 0.971), all of the lower 95% CI values fell well below 0.66, indicating poor precision. All subgroups had good to high agreement for total PP, LT, and TM scores, as indicated by ICC values of 0.87 and higher. There were lower 95% CI (LCI) values for the 6- to 11-year-old group with incomplete paraplegia due to the low number of subjects in that subgroup (N=4). The LCI values were poor for PP for the subgroups with 6- to 11-year-olds with incomplete tetraplegia (LCI = 0.675) and the 12- to 15-year-old group with incomplete paraplegia (LCI = 0.707) and for TM for 16- to 21-year-old group with complete paraplegia (LCI = 0.706).
Latent variable structural equation modeling was used to identify underlying factors and their relationship with participant characteristics. Seven specific factors were identified by exploratory factor analysis and were cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis. They included: (a) healthy nutrition, (b) unhealthy nutrition, (c) fitness, (d) smoking, (e) alcohol use, (f) psychotropic prescription medications, and (g) SCI healthy activities. Two higher-order dimensions were also identified, including a risk dimension (b, d, e) and a protective dimension (a, c, g). Participant characteristics were associated with the domains. For instance, participants with the most severe injuries scored lower on smoking and alcohol but higher on psychotropic medications; age was positively correlated with healthy nutrition and negatively correlated with alcohol and tobacco use but also negatively correlated with fitness.
Intravenous administration of rolipram increased phrenic nerve output in uninjured control and left C2 spinal cord-hemisected rats. In addition, rolipram restored respiratory-related activity to the left phrenic nerve made quiescent by the hemisection. In both uninjured and hemisected rats, rolipram significantly enhanced phrenic inspiratory burst amplitude and burst area compared with predrug values. Also, rolipram concomitantly increased spinal and medullary cAMP.
A dose-dependent change in the Ashworth score and lower limb motor score was observed during titration of oral and ITB. Whereas the Hoffman (H)-reflex was abolished after the introduction of ITB, the flexion withdrawal reflex approximated a dose-dependent pattern. Changes in the motor score and EMG during voluntary muscle activation were proportionally smaller than the corresponding changes in clinical and neurophysiologic measures of spasticity. Neurophysiologic assessment largely paralleled clinical findings.
A 28-year-old man presented with back pain and retrograde ejaculations resulting in infertility. After microsurgical excision of large perineurial cysts, back pain resolved, but semen quality showed only marginal improvement. Later, the couple successfully conceived by intrauterine insemination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Tarlov cyst associated with retrograde ejaculation and infertility.
A young man presented with a history of several admissions to the emergency department with complaints of hypertensive attacks, palpitations, difficulty in breathing, headaches, and flushing. The attacks were attributed to a previously diagnosed anxiety disorder. Onset of numbness of the left leg numbness prompted a more thorough study, which showed evidence of MS. AD was suspected as the cause of his recurrent attacks of hypertension. Bladder distension was identified as the cause of AD, and his hypertensive attacks were controlled by management of neurogenic bladder.
Symptoms improved after treatment with furosemide, warfarin, ramipril, and continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea.
Only one tool, the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT), scored highly on primary care features, as it was designed to assess both structural and process features of primary care and is available in multiple user formats.
The optic disc and the automated perimetry in both relatives was normal reassessment of visual field at the patient show a normal appearance.
327 ophthalmologists have responded; 70% have more than 10 years of practice; 50% are each managing 100 to 500 glaucoma patients. 2/3 of participants are using the Goldmann aplanotonometer, 38% are assessing visual field in automated perimetry, 61% are examining the optic discs using an direct ophthalmoscope and 80% are currently performing gonioscopy. 55% are treating ocular hypertension under special circumstances, 93% are using initial monotherapy, 3/4 are using prostaglandin derivates as initial therapy and 79% are resorting to fixed combinations when the initial monotherapy has become inefficient. Most participants desire to use modern diagnostic methods and treatments in glaucoma, to continuously improve the education in glaucoma management and to collaborate efficiently with other healthcare partners.
We have collected data concerning 330 eyes (238 patients). The mean follow-up period was 13.85 +/- 11.03 months (limits 0.5-91 months). The mean visual acuity was 0.31 +/- 0.33 and did not alter significantly. The mean initial IOP was 27.25 +/- 13.64 mmHg (50% of eyes were already under treatment, receiving an average of 1.66 +/- 0.72 drugs). During the follow-up period 66.66% of eyes were subject to antiglaucoma surgery. The mean interval from diagnosis to surgery was 10.24 +/- 23.34 months. The final IOP was significantly decreased to 17.02 +/- 7.77 mmHg (68.96% of eyes were receiving topical antiglaucoma therapy, the mean number of drugs being 1.57 +/- 0.71). The C/D ratio increased from 0.76 +/- 0.26 to 0.81 +/- 0.24 (p = 0.01). In automated perimetry the mean deviation increased from 17.13 +/- 11.68 to 17.51 +/- 10.83 (the increase was not significant, p = 0.87). The pattern standard deviation increased from 5.92 +/- 3.83 to 6.16 +/- 3.19 (p = 0.63). A number of 75 patients (31.51%) had cardiovascular diseases, most frequently arterial hypertension (27.31%) and myocardial ischemia (9.66%).
The direct microscopy revealed ectothrix-type hair shaft infection forming a sheath of small-spores on the outside of eyebrows hairs and M. canis was identified on cultures of Sabouraud's dextrose in all cases. Systemic treatment was initiated with griseofulvin 1000 mg/day in two patients and with terbinafine 250 mg/day in four patients associated with topical antimycotics for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of treatment mycological cure was obtained in 100% of cases.
In the Ophthalmology Clinic in Targu-Mures we operated, during those 20 months, 106 patients with pterygium. Of these, 36 were operated using the limbo-conjunctival autografting, the rest using the Arlt technique. We noticed less relapse when the limbo-conjunctival autografting was used. In the Ophthalmology Clinic in Debrecen, during a 15 months period, there were 33 patients operated for pterygium. The largest number of relapses was noticed with the Arlt technique.
Major depression and alcohol or substance abuse 21 months after the parent's death were more common among bereaved youth than among comparison subjects. Offspring with parental suicide or accidental death had higher rates of depression than comparison subjects; those with parental suicide had higher rates of alcohol or substance abuse. Youth with parental suicide had a higher incidence of depression than those bereaved by sudden natural death. Bereavement and a past history of depression increased depression risk in the 9 months following the death, which increased depression risk between 9 and 21 months. Losing a mother, blaming others, low self-esteem, negative coping, and complicated grief were associated with depression in the second year.
Relative to the control group, subjects who received active training showed significant gains in global cognition, verbal working memory, and verbal learning and memory. They also showed reliable and significant improvement in auditory psychophysical performance; this improvement was significantly correlated with gains in verbal working memory and global cognition.
Approximately 2.5 years after onset of their index episode, 81.5% of the participants had fully recovered, but 1.5 years later 62.5% had a syndromal recurrence, particularly depression. One-third of the participants had one syndromal recurrence, and 30% had two or more. The polarity of the index episode predicted that of subsequent episodes. Participants were symptomatic during 60% of the follow-up period, particularly with subsyndromal symptoms of depression and mixed polarity, with numerous changes in mood polarity. Manic symptomatology, especially syndromal, was less frequent, and bipolar II was mainly manifested by depressive symptoms. Overall, 40% of the participants had syndromal or subsyndromal symptoms during 75% of the follow-up period, and 16% of the participants experienced psychotic symptoms during 17% the follow-up period. Twenty-five percent of youths with bipolar II converted to bipolar I, and 38% of those with bipolar disorder not otherwise specified converted to bipolar I or II. Early onset, diagnosis of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified, long illness duration, low socioeconomic status, and family history of mood disorders were associated with poorer outcomes.
Performance on the UPSA-B was essentially identical in the two samples (New York, mean score=13.84; Sweden, mean score=13.30), as were scores on the case manager ratings of everyday activities (New York, mean=49.0; Sweden, mean=48.8). The correlations between UPSA-B score, neuropsychological test performance, and case manager ratings did not differ across the two samples. The proportion of patients who had never had a close relationship and the rate of vocational disability were also nearly identical. However, while 80% of the Swedish patients were living independently, only 46% of the New York patients were.
Children with any history of institutional rearing had more psychiatric disorders than children without such a history (53.2% versus 22.0%). Children removed from institutions and placed in foster families were less likely to have internalizing disorders than children who continued with care as usual (22.0% versus 44.2%). Boys were more symptomatic than girls regardless of their caregiving environment and, unlike girls, had no reduction in total psychiatric symptoms following foster placement.
Findings revealed a significant increase in GCP II protein and a reduction in mGluR3 protein in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia subjects, with mGluR2 protein levels unchanged. Chronic antipsychotic treatment in rodents did not influence GCP II or mGluR3 levels.
The total scores of JPAC and C-ACT strongly correlated each other. Among 3 groups in JPAC the score of JPAC weakly correlated with %FEV1, FEV1/FVC and %MMF. In contrast there was no correlation between 2 groups C-ACT. FEV1/FVC and %MMF were significantly different among the groups identified by the JPAC, but not among those by the C-ACT. Neither of the total scores of JPAC nor C-ACT correlated with FENO.
17 patients (85%) showed no immediate allergic response to lidocaine, which could then be used for dental treatment. Three patients (15%) reacted positively to lidocaine: one had local erythema at the site of the skin prick, and two reacted to subcutaneous challenge.
Artemisinin and propofol depletion data in human liver microsomes were described by first order kinetic models. For bupropion and efavirenz, metabolite formation data were incorporated in the model. Rate constants varied considerably for all substrates. There was a high degree of correlation of rate constants between substrates (r&gt; or =0.87, p&lt;0.001).
33/50 cases of vascular calcification were identified by radiographic film. Calcifications of the abdominal aorta and peripheral muscular arteries were seen in 90.9 and 36.4%. Patients with moderate to severe calcification were older, more likely to be male, had lower diastolic blood pressure and fetuin-A levels, and a higher incidence of diabetes than those with mild calcification. Logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes and plasma fetuin-A were independent risk factors for vascular calcification.
The site of catheter insertion was internal jugular (n = 2,133), subclavian (n = 79) and femoral (n = 17). Duration of catheter use was as follows: 30-90 days (n = 1,607) and &gt;90 days (n = 1,054); 226 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 197 catheters. Microorganisms responsible were mainly Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall incidence of bacteremic episodes was 0.514/1,000 catheter days. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, site of catheter implantation, duration of catheter use, Wright-Khan comorbidity index and previous history of CRB were significant risk factors associated with bacteremia in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that a previous history of a bacteremic episode (odds ratio, OR = 2.70, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.56-4.68), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.65-3.39), duration of catheter use &gt;90 days (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.35-2.55) and hypertension (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.08-2.04) were still significant factors associated with bacteremia.
Serum myeloperoxidase and hsCRP levels in the UD group were significantly decreased at 6 months compared with the CD group. Multivariate analysis showed that decreases in non-HDL-cholesterol and ApoB at 6 months were independently correlated with changes in myeloperoxidase.
Total bilirubin was identified as the most accurate predictor of the short-term prognosis of 46 recipients (optimal cut-off point: 13.3 mg/dl). Eleven patients received 14 plasma exchange sessions. Elevation of total bilirubin was significantly suppressed after plasma exchange in the patients with total bilirubin below the median (24 mg/dl), whereas total bilirubin significantly increased even after plasma exchange in those with total bilirubin above the median.
The interstitial concentrations of MIP-1 alpha, MMP-9/NGAL and IL-8 were similar in patients and healthy subjects, while the corresponding concentration of MCP-1 was significantly higher in patients on HDF or high-flux HD as compared with healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.01).
Dialysate total iron was increased (+19%, p &lt; 0.01) during intravenous infusion of IS. Immediately after infusion the concentration of 8-OHdG was increased in plasma (+10%, p &lt; 0.01) and in dialysate (+5%, p &lt; 0.05). IS infusion caused a transient decrease in peritoneal permeability to protein (-42%, p &lt; 0.05) and glucose (-30%, p &lt; 0.01) and a reduction in dialysate cell count (-58%, p &lt; 0.05). During the exchange dialysate hyaluronan was increased by 27% (p &lt; 0.01). Spent dialysate, tested ex vivo on cultured MC, induced oxidative stress (+39%, p &lt; 0.01), slowed their proliferation (-20%, p &lt; 0.01), and stimulated MCP-1 synthesis (+46%, p &lt; 0.01). Iron content in MCs exposed to dialysate obtained after IS infusion was increased by 32% (p &lt; 0.01).
Seventy-four HD patients without ischemic heart disease (age 51.6 +/- 13.2 years; male:female ratio 36:38; diabetes 37.8%) were recruited. Post-HD ECW/TBW was positively correlated to log cTnT levels (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariate regression models, male sex (beta = 0.23, p = 0.03), diabetes mellitus (beta = 0.21, p = 0.04), log high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (beta = 0.21, p = 0.04) and post-HD ECW/TBW (beta = 0.37, p &lt; 0.01) were independent risk factors for elevated log cTnT levels.
Forty-two PD patients were enrolled. They had been on PD for at least 1 month and free of peritonitis for at least 1 month prior to the study. Patients with high or high average PET had higher dialysate IL-6 and VEGF-C. Dialysate IL-6 and VEGF-C correlated negatively with PET and UF.
CAD females showed an excess of ACP1 *A/*C and *B/*C genotypes and a deficiency of ACP1 *B/*B genotype compared to controls, while CAD males did not show significant differences. Among diabetic women the proportion of *C allele carriers was much greater in those with CAD than in those without CAD. This difference was much less evident in nondiabetic women.
Clinical follow-up was available in 100%. Angiographic follow-up was 87.3% in group A and 86% in group B (p = 0.922). There were significant differences in major adverse cardiac events at 1 (p = 0.014) and 2 years (p = 0.002) between group B (19.8%, 25.0%) and group A (9.1%, 10.4%), mainly due to increased target-vessel revascularization (16.7, 21.9% in group B vs. 6.1, 7.3% in group A, p = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). The double-stent technique was associated with worse outcomes at 1 year in group B compared to group A. Bifurcation lesions (HR 3.42, 95% CI 1.34-5.61, p = 0.001), diabetes (HR 2.68, 95% CI 2.01-12.11, p = 0.015), three-vessel disease (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.27-0.96, p = 0.001), incomplete revascularization (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.11-0.35, p = 0.001) and stent diameter (HR 5.05, 95% CI 2.71-10.01, p = 0.03) were the independent factors of major adverse cardiac events in the whole patient cohort.
All CHF groups showed significant rises of [5-HT](p) and [5-HT](pt). DD&amp;LVH and D&amp;SD individuals also had increased [5-HIAA](p). Levels of SAS blood biomarkers were also significantly changed. The correlation between SS and SAS was increased in CHF and corresponded with disease severity.
AR CF exhibited 2.9-fold greater c-Jun phosphorylation (p &lt; 0.01) and 1.5- to 2-fold greater ATF2 phosphorylation (p &lt; 0.05-0.01) than NL. JNK and p38MAPK inhibition reduced c-Jun and ATF2 phosphorylation to NL; ERK inhibition had no effect. FN mRNA expression was similar in pattern to kinase activities. Cyclic strain in NL CF increased c-Jun phosphorylation 2-fold versus unstrained controls (p &lt; 0.005). This was suppressed by inhibition of JNK but not p38MAPK.
4EBP-based peptides bound eIF4E, prevented eIF4E from binding eIF4G, and inhibited cap-dependent translation. GnRH agonist-4EBP fusion peptide was taken up by, and inhibited the growth of, GnRH receptor-expressing tumor cells, but not receptor-negative cells. Intraperitoneal tumor burden was significantly smaller in mice treated with fusion peptide than in mice treated with saline (P &lt; 0.001). Ascites was also reduced in peptide-treated mice. Significant cytotoxic effects to host tissues were not observed. On the other hand, treatment with GnRH agonist alone did not inhibit tumor growth or ascites.
The mean number of T cells infused was 4.26 x 10(10) (range, 1.59-5.0). At day 14 after transplant, the median CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts were 4,198, 1,545, and 2,858 cells/microL, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-15 levels increased early after transplant and IL-15 levels correlated significantly to day 14 T-cell counts. Robust vaccine-specific B- and T-cell responses were generated. T-cell infusions were well tolerated with no effect on hematopoietic recovery. Eight patients (16%) developed a T-cell "engraftment syndrome" characterized by diarrhea and fever that was clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from grade 1 to 3 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract (seven patients) and/or grade 1 to 2 cutaneous GVHD (four patients).
B16ova was resistant to direct oncolysis in vitro, and failed to support reovirus replication in vitro or in vivo. Nevertheless, reovirus purged lymph node and splenic metastases in C57BL/6 mice and generated antitumor immunity. In contrast, reovirus failed to reduce tumor burden in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing either B16ova or reovirus-sensitive B16tk metastases. In the human system, reovirus acted solely as an adjuvant when added to dendritic cells already loaded with Mel888, supporting priming of specific antitumor cytotoxic lymphocyte, in the absence of significant direct tumor oncolysis; UV-treated nonreplicating reovirus was similarly immunogenic.
Deletion of CTR1 reduced the uptake of Cu, DDP, and CBDCA and increased resistance to their cytotoxic effects by 2- to 3-fold. Knockdown of CTR2 increased uptake of Cu only in the CTR1(+/+) cells. In contrast, knockdown of CTR2 increased whole-cell DDP uptake and DNA platination in both CTR1(+/+) and CTR1(-/-) cells and proportionately enhanced cytotoxicity while producing no effect on vesicular accumulation or efflux. A significant correlation was found between CTR2 mRNA and protein levels and sensitivity to DDP in a panel of six ovarian carcinoma cell lines.
GAB2 amplifications were found in 9% of the cases and were associated with melanomas arising from acral and mucosal sites (P = 0.005). Increased copy numbers of the KIT locus were observed in 6% of the cases. The overall mutation frequencies for BRAF and NRAS were 43.5% and 14%, respectively, and were mutually exclusive. Among the acral and mucosal melanomas studied, the genetic alteration frequency was 26% for GAB2, 13% for KIT, 30% for BRAF, and 4% for NRAS. Importantly, the majority of GAB2 amplifications occurred independent from genetic events in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.
Under the multiplexing mode, the limit of detection of salivary IL-8 mRNA reaches to 3.9 fM and 7.4 pg/mL for IL-8 protein in saliva. Multiplex assay of these 2 biomarkers directly from 28 cancer and 28 matched control saliva samples shows significant difference between the two groups. From the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the EC sensor yields around 90% sensitivity and specificity for both IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 protein, which are very close to the data measured by traditional assays (ELISA and PCR) with the same group of saliva. Combined IL-8 mRNA and protein show better AUC compared with single biomarker.
The in vitro growth-inhibitory effects of NK012 were 198- to 532-fold more potent than those of CPT-11. A significant difference in the relative tumor volume on day 30 was found between NK012/CDDP and CPT-11/CDDP treatments (P = 0.0058). Inflammatory changes in the small intestinal mucosa were rare in all NK012-treated mice but were commonly observed in CPT-11-treated mice. Moreover, a large amount of CPT-11 was excreted into the feces and high CPT-11 concentration was detected in the small intestinal epithelium. On the other hand, a small amount of NK012 was found in the feces and NK012 was weakly and uniformly distributed in the mucosal interstitium.
Positive expressions of DBC1 and SIRT1 were seen in 62% (109 of 177) and in 73% (130 of 177) of patients, respectively. Expression of DBC1 was significantly correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.007), lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.001), tumor invasion (P = 0.001), venous invasion (P = 0.001), histologic types (P &lt; 0.001), p53 expression (P &lt; 0.001), and SIRT1 expression (P &lt; 0.001). SIRT1 expression was also significantly correlated with tumor stage (P &lt; 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.001), tumor invasion (P &lt; 0.001), histologic types (P &lt; 0.001), and p53 expression (P = 0.001). In addition, expression of DBC1 was significantly associated with shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival by univariate analysis (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). SIRT1 expression was also significantly associated with shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival by univariate analysis (P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor stage and expression of DBC1 were independent prognostic factors significantly associated with overall survival and relapse-free survival.
RS (n = 69) displayed a higher prevalence of stereotyped BCR (P &lt; 0.001) compared with nontransformed CLL. The actuarial risk of RS transformation was significantly higher in CLL carrying stereotyped BCR (P &lt; 0.001). Among BCR subsets most represented in CLL, subset 8 using IGHV4-39/IGHD6-13/IGHJ5 carried the highest risk of RS transformation [hazard ratio (HR), 24.50; P &lt; 0.001]. Multivariate analysis selected stereotyped BCR (HR, 3.33; P = 0.001) and IGHV4-39 usage (HR, 4.03; P = 0.004) as independent predictors of RS transformation. The combination of IGHV4-39 usage and stereotyped BCR in the same patient identified CLL with a very high risk of RS transformation (5-year risk, 68.7%). The risk carried by stereotyped BCR and IGHV4-39 usage was specific for RS transformation and had no effect on CLL progression without transformation.
Runx2 nuclear expression was found to be up-regulated in prostate cancer and its expression could be used as a predictor of metastasis in prostate cancer. Further mechanistic studies indicated that Runx2 accelerated prostate cancer aggressiveness through promotion of cadherin switching, invasion toward collagen I, and Akt activation. Subsequently, we found that FTY720 treatment down-regulated Runx2 expression and its transcriptional activity, as well as inhibited its regulated downstream events. More importantly, silencing Runx2 in PC-3 enhanced FTY720-induced anticancer effects as well as cell viability inhibition, whereas overexpressing Runx2 in 22Rv1 that expressed very low endogenous Runx2 protein conferred resistance in the same events.
Forty-seven of the 553 training group patients and 22 of 378 test group IgG patients developed MM after a median follow-up of 6.7 and 3.6 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that serum monoclonal component (MC) levels of &lt; or =1.5 g/dL, the absence of light-chain proteinuria and normal serum polyclonal immunoglobulin levels defined a prognostically favorable subset of patients, and could be used to stratify the patients into three groups at different 10-year risk of evolution (hazard ratio, 1.0, 5.04, 11.2; P &lt; 0.001). This scoring system was validated in the test sample. Thirty of the 352 IgA patients developed MM after a median follow-up of 4.8 years, and multivariate analysis showed that hemoglobin levels of &lt;12.5 g/dL and reduced serum polyclonal immunoglobulin correlated with progression. A pooled statistical analysis of all of the patients confirmed the validity of Mayo Clinic risk model showing that IgA class, serum MC levels, and light-chain proteinuria are the most important variables correlated with disease progression.
Primary tumor samples exhibited a variable degree of immunoreactivity for CD133/1, ranging from 1.3% to 62.6%, but stained negatively for other endothelial and stem cell-associated markers. Isolated CD133(+) cells expanded up to 4.6-fold in serum-replenished cultures and coexpressed the GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr MUC-1 glycoform, a well-characterized tumor-associated antigen. Dissociated bulk tumors formed sphere-like structures; cells grown as tumor spheres maintained CD133 expression and could be propagated for up to 12 weeks. CD133(+) cells purified from endometrioid adenocarcinomas were resistant to cisplatin-induced and paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity and expressed a peculiar gene signature consisting of high levels of matrix metalloproteases, interleukin-8, CD44, and CXCR4. When serially transplanted into NOD/SCID mice, CD133(+) cells were capable of initiating tumor formation and recapitulating the phenotype of the original tumor.
We found that ESO-specific CD4(+) T cell clones from patient C2 recognize peptide ESO(119-143) (core region 123-137) presented by HLA-DR52b (HLA-DRB3*0202), a MHC class II allele expressed by about half of Caucasians. Importantly, following vaccination, all patients expressing DR52b developed significant responses to the identified epitope, accounting for, on average, half of the total CD4(+) T cell responses to the 119-143 immunodominant region. In addition, analysis of ESO-specific DR52b-restricted CD4(+) T cells at the clonal level revealed significant conservation of T cell receptor usage among different individuals.
EphA2 expression was detected in &gt;90% of tumor samples. Expression of EphA2 was positively correlated with activated EGFR but not with EGFR mutations. EphA2 expression was increased in patients harboring K-Ras mutations. EphA2 expression was positively correlated with a history of smoking, and high EphA2 scores predicted poorer progression-free and overall survivals.
Seven eligible trials were identified for a total of 148 non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations. The overall response rate to gefitinib was 76.4% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 69.5-83.2]. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 9.7 months (95% CI, 8.2-11.1) and 24.3 months (95% CI, 19.8-28.2), respectively. Good performance status and chemotherapy-naïve status were significantly associated with a longer progression-free survival or overall survival. Of the 148 patients, 87 received gefitinib as a first-line therapy, whereas 61 received systemic chemotherapy before gefitinib treatment. The median progression-free survival after the start of first-line therapy was significantly longer in the gefitinib-first group than in the chemotherapy-first group (10.7 versus 6.0 months; P &lt; 0.001), whereas no significant difference in median overall survival was apparent between the two groups (27.7 versus 25.7 months; P = 0.782).
Forty-one patients were included. Dose-limiting toxicities during the C--&gt;T schedule were grade 4 thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia (MTD: carboplatin target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration versus time curve, 4 min mg/mL; topotecan, 0.5 mg/m(2)/d). Dose-limiting toxicities during the T--&gt;C schedule included grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever, and grade 4 nausea and vomiting (MTD: carboplatin target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration versus time curve, 6 min mg/mL; topotecan, 0.9 mg/m(2)/d). One complete response and five partial responses were observed. The clearance of and exposure to carboplatin and topotecan did not depend on the sequence of drug administration. No schedule-dependent effects were seen in Pt-DNA levels and DNA topoisomerase I catalytic activity in WBC and tumor tissue. However, myelotoxicity was clearly more evident in the C--&gt;T schedule.
Met distribution was significantly different between the metastatic group and the group with localized prostate cancer and people with no evidence of cancer (P &lt; 0.0001). The area under the curve for localized and metastatic disease was 0.90, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.84 to 0.95. Yeast two-hybrid technology, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and Human Interactome identified 89 proteins that interact with met, of which 40 have previously been associated with metastatic prostate cancer.
We show B-cell dysregulation in patients with advanced melanoma (n = 26) and other solid tumors (n = 13), marked by a relative and absolute loss of CD27+ (memory) B cells and associated with an aberrant systemic plasmacytosis. Functionally, B cells from patients with melanoma inefficiently up-regulated immunoregulatory molecules and weakly secreted cytokines in response to CD40 and toll-like receptor 9 agonists. Stimulated B cells from patients induced proliferation of alloreactive CD4+ T cells, but these T cells poorly secreted IFNgamma and interleukin-2. These effects were recapitulated by using purified normal donor CD27(neg) B cells in these same assays, linking the predominance of CD27(neg) B cells in patients with the observed functional hyporesponsiveness. Indeed, B-cell dysfunction in patients strongly correlated with the extent of loss of CD27+ B cells in peripheral blood.
TAM, characterized by the positive expression of CD45, F4/80, and CD11b, formed the major population of infiltrating tumor cells. TAM displayed high basal Arginase I activity, producing interleukin-10 (IL-10); they were resistant to iNOSII activity induction, therefore reversion to M1 phenotype, when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide/IFNgamma, indicating an M2 phentoype. In cultures of isolated TAM, TAM induced regulatory phenotype, characterized by IL-10 and Foxp3 expression, and inhibited proliferation of CD8 lymphocytes. In vivo, depletion of TAM inhibited tumor growth and stimulated the infiltration of tumors by HPV16 E7(49-57)-specific CD8 lymphocytes, whereas depletion of Gr1(+) tumor-associated cells had no effect.
Immune recognition of Hip1 increased in patients whose basal cell carcinoma lesions were treated with PDT. This increase in reactivity was significantly greater than reactivity observed in patients whose lesions were surgically removed. Patients with superficial lesions exhibited greater enhancement of reactivity compared with patients with nodular lesions. Immune reactivity following PDT was inversely correlated with treatment area and light dose.
We showed a strong tumor infiltration with immature DCs and a reduction in the number of mature DCs in lymphoid organs during melanoma progression. DCs from melanoma-bearing mice secreted significantly more interleukin 10 and less interleukin 12p70, and showed a decreased capacity to activate T cells compared with DCs from tumor-free animals. Observed DC dysfunction was linked to considerable activation of p38 MAPK. Inhibition of its activity in spleen DCs from tumor-bearing mice led to normalization of their cytokine secretion pattern and T-cell stimulation capacity.
Twelve patients were treated, with mean age of 63 years (range, 32-77). Two of six patients at the first dose level had DLTs (grade 4 neutropenia). The dose was reduced to 1,600 MBq/m(2), and CA4P escalated to 54 mg/m(2). Again, two of six patients had DLTs (neutropenia). Of ten assessable patients, three had stable disease and seven had progressive disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography confirmed tumor antibody uptake in all 10 patients. DCE-MRI confirmed falls in kinetic parameters (K(trans)/IAUGC(60)) in 9 of 12 patients. The change of both pharmacokinetic parameters reached a level expected to produce efficacy in one patient who had a minor response on computed tomography and a reduced serum tumor marker level.
Microarray analysis was done to screen for genes up-regulated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In RPMI8226 cells, 128 genes were up-regulated, whereas 83 genes were up-regulated in KMS12PE cells. Methylation of 22 genes with CpG islands in their 5' regions, including RASD1, was confirmed. Methylation of RASD1 was associated with its inactivation, which correlated with resistance to dexamethasone. Treating multiple myeloma cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored sensitivity to dexamethasone. Methylation of RASD1 was also detected in a subset of primary multiple myeloma specimens, and the levels of methylation were increased after repeated antitumor treatments. Gene signature analysis revealed various genes to be synergistically induced by treatment with a combination of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine plus dexamethasone.
Cyclin D1 overexpression was associated with a low cancer-specific mortality in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.006), and in both univariate Cox regression [unadjusted HR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-0.88; P = 0.0063] and multivariate analyses (adjusted HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84; P = 0.0048). Similar findings were observed for an overall mortality (adjusted HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.98; P = 0.036). Notably, the effect of cyclin D1 on survival might differ by MSI status (P(interaction) = 0.008). Compared with tumors that were both cyclin D1-negative and MSI-low/microsatellite stable, the presence of either cyclin D1 or MSI-high or both seemed to confer better clinical outcome (adjusted HR point estimates, 0.10-0.65).
Among 76 metastatic colorectal cancer patients, KRAS mutations in tumors and in peripheral blood were identified in 33 (43.4%) and 30 (39.5%) patients, respectively. The detection sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of membrane-arrays for CTCs with KRAS oncogene were 84.4%, 95.3%, and 90.8%, respectively, and indeed a highly significant correlation to KRAS mutations in tumors (P &lt; 0.0001) was observed. Forty-five (59.2%) patients responded to cetuximab plus chemotherapy, and 41 and 40 were wild-type KRAS in tumors and peripheral blood, respectively (both P &lt; 0.0001). Patients with tumors that harbor wild-type KRAS are more likely to have a better progression-free survival and overall survival when treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.0001). Likewise, patients with CTCs of wild-type KRAS in peripheral blood express a better progression-free survival and overall survival when treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.0001).
IT-101 and CPT had very high in vitro cytotoxicity against all lymphoma cell lines tested. As compared with CPT-11 and SN-38, IT-101 and CPT had longer release kinetics and significantly inhibit higher tumor DNA topo I catalytic activities. Furthermore, IT-101 showed significantly prolonged the survival of animals bearing s.c. and disseminated human xenografts when compared with CPT-11 at its maximum tolerated dose in mice.
The combined analyses in one phase II trial lead to smaller expected sample sizes when the drug is broadly inactive, and to greater statistical power if there is modest activity across multiple strata as compared with conducting several smaller phase II studies. In addition, by retaining the stratum-specific tests, the design allows the identification of subgroups for which the agents are most active.
In rats bearing large GBMs (day 9), the combination of Ad-Flt3L with Ad-FasL did not improve survival over FasL alone, whereas Ad-Flt3L combined with Ad-TK+GCV led to 70% long-term survival. Expression of FasL and TRAIL caused severe neuropathology, which was not encountered when we used Ad-TK+/-Ad-Flt3L. In vitro, all treatments elicited release of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) from dying tumor cells. In vivo, the highest levels of circulating HMGB1 were observed after treatment with Ad-TK+GCV+Ad-Flt3L; HMGB1 was necessary for the therapeutic efficacy of AdTK+GCV+Ad-Flt3L because its blockade with glycyrrhizin completely blocked tumor regression. We also showed the killing efficacy of Ad-TK+GCV in human GBM cell lines and GBM primary cultures, which also elicited release of HMGB1.
HPLC analysis showed that maximum uptake and release of both drugs had occurred by approximately 60 minutes, with the slopes tending to flatten after this point. The retention time on the HPLC column was 8.08 minutes for timolol maleate and 2.16 minutes for brimonidine tartrate after incubation for one hour, with no changes after seven hours. Patient data showed that use of the lenses maintained IOP at levels equivalent to those obtained with previous treatment. No ocular toxicity was observed.
At the sixth month of treatment, CT measurements were significantly changed in both groups, compared to baseline. In the CsA treatment group, the mean CCT before and after six months of treatment were 517.4 +/- 36.2 and 546.5 +/- 32.4 microm, respectively (p &lt; 0.001); yielding an average CCT increase of 29.1 +/- 8.0 microm (5.62 per cent) from baseline. In the control group, corresponding figures were 520.2 +/- 34.2 and 526.0 +/- 35.4 microm, respectively (p &lt; 0.01), with an average increase of 5.8 +/- 3.1 microm (1.11 per cent).
Genetic analyses provided direct confirmation of compound heterozygosity. The compound heterozygote showed Schmidt's sign, consistent with an extreme skew in her L : M cone ratio and usually associated with protan carrier status.
Three new elements of competency have been added to the standards. Twenty-three new performance criteria with associated indicators have been added. Some performance criteria from the earlier document have been combined. Substantial alterations were made to the presentation of indicators throughout the document. The updated entry-level (universal) and therapeutic competency standards were adopted on behalf of the profession by the National Council of Optometrists Association Australia in November 2008.
A total of 2,838 patients were entered into the registry, of whom 2,224 had reached 12 months of follow-up. Mean age was 54.7 years. A total of 2,363 patients (83.3%) were female. A significant improvement was seen in obstructive defecation and symptom severity scores and quality of life between baseline and 12 months (obstructed defecation score: 15.8 vs. 5.8, respectively, P &lt; 0.001; symptom severity score: 15.1 vs. 3.6, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Complications were reported in 36.0% and included defecatory urgency (20.0%), bleeding (5.0%), septic events (4.4%), staple line complications (3.5%), and incontinence (1.8%). One case of rectal necrosis and one case of rectovaginal fistula were reported.
Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery was performed in 58 (56.3%) patients, and pure laparoscopic surgery in 45 (43.7%) patients. Mean follow-up time was 42.1 months. The conversion rate was 2.9%. All specimen margins were negative. The anastomotic leak rate was 7.8% (n = 8). There was no 30-day mortality. Local recurrence rate was 5% at five years. Overall survival was 91% and disease-free survival was 73.1% at five years.
En bloc lateral pelvic wall dissection and vascular resection with pelvic exenteration was performed in 36 patients of 107 exenterations. All patients underwent surgery with curative intent. Negative margins were achieved in 19 patients (53%). Ten patients (28%) developed recurrence at the site of resection compared with 26 patients (72%) who remained disease free at the site of surgery. Sixteen patients (46%) are disease-free with the average disease-free interval of 30 months. Twenty-five patients (69%) are alive with a mean follow-up of 19 months. No mortalities occurred in this cohort of patients.
Thirteen patients (87%) progressed to permanent stimulation. Median fecal incontinence episodes per two weeks decreased from 15 (range, 1-53) to 3 (range, 0-16; P = 0.01). Median soiling episodes were reduced from 10 (range, 1-14) to 6 (range, 0-14; P = 0.009). Median Cleveland Clinic scores decreased from 12 (range, 9-18) to 9 (range, 4-14; P = 0.0005). The ability to defer defecation was improved significantly (P = 0.05). There were no relationships between sphincter defect scores and outcome measures after sacral nerve stimulation (r = 0.001-0.10; P = 0.28-0.94).
Ten patients were included in the study. All patients were discharged within 23 hours from the commencement of surgery. There were no complications and no readmissions to the hospital. All patients were satisfied with the service; all ten would request to follow the same pathway again if required, and all would recommend it to other patients.
Disease-free survival rates were: lymph node ratio 1, 75.5%; lymph node ratio 2, 74.2%; lymph node ratio 3, 73.2%; and lymph node ratio 4, 40.1%. Similar differences were observed for cancer-specific and overall survival rates. Cases with lymph node ratio &gt;or=0.25 had higher hazard ratios than cases with lymph node ratio &lt;0.25 in terms of disease-free survival (2.8, P &lt; 0.001), cancer-specific survival (3.1, P = 0.0001), and overall survival (2.2, P = 0.0001). The hazard ratio of cases with up to three positive nodes and lymph node ratios &gt;or=0.25 was higher than that of cases with up to three positive nodes and lymph node ratios &lt;0.25 in terms of disease-free survival (3.1, P = 0.003), cancer-specific survival (3.5, P = 0.002), and overall survival (2.4, P = 0.02). Similar differences were found for cases with more than three positive nodes. Lymph node ratio, but not number of positive nodes, had independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. No interaction between these two variables was found.
One hundred seventy patients received a questionnaire, and 121 (71%) responded. Of the responders, 33 (27.3%) patients suffered from severe postoperative complications. The median follow-up was 36 months. In the univariate analysis, patients with severe postoperative complications had a lower score on physical functioning (73 vs. 85, P = 0.031) and higher scores on pain (17 vs. 0, P = 0.025) and fatigue (33 vs. 22, P = 0.036). Stoma construction (n = 51) was associated with a higher global health status (83 vs. 75, P = 0.019), and these patients reported fewer gastrointestinal problems (P = 0.001).
Four hundred and seventy-five polyposis patients with a previous colectomy were included. Cumulative risks of secondary proctectomy 20 years after primary colectomy were 10%, 39%, and 61% in the attenuated, intermediate, and severe genotype groups, respectively (P &lt; 0.05, groups compared separately). Cumulative risks of rectal cancer after primary colectomy were 3.7%, 9.3%, and 8.3%, respectively, in the three groups (P &gt; 0.05, groups compared separately).
The analysis comprised 1,081 patients with colon cancer and 710 patients with rectal cancer. Stage distribution was as follows: Stage I, 480 patients; Stage II, 785 patients; Stage III, 472 patients; and Stage IV, 54 patients. The "cause-specific" failure rate, the "relative" failure rate, and the cumulative incidence in the presence of competing risks at five years (95% CI) for all patients were 21.1 (range, 19.0-23.4) %, 22.5 (range, 19.6-25.2) %, and 19.0 (range, 17.0-20.9) %, respectively.
There were 623 patients in the younger group (mean age, 62.6 years) and 275 in the older group (mean age, 81.5 years). The in-hospital mortality rate was 1% in the younger group compared with 4.2% in the older (P = 0.002). The overall five-year survival was 68.7% and 57.3% in the younger and older groups, respectively, whereas colorectal cancer-specific five-year survival was not significantly different (74.0% vs. 74.7%). There were significant differences between the two groups with respect to cancer location, American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, stage, proportion detected by screening, length of stay, and use of chemotherapy.
There was a mean of 6.5 lymph nodes per patient and 12 positive nodes of the 201 recovered (6%). Ninety-five percent of all lymph nodes were &lt;5 mm, whereas 50% of positive lymph nodes were &lt;3 mm. Metastatic lymph nodes were significantly greater in size (5.0 vs. 2.5mm; P = 0.02). Lymph nodes &gt;4.5 mm had a greater risk of harboring metastases (P = 0.009).
Twenty-three pelvic pouches failed (8%), and six continent ileostomies (10%) were excised (difference not significant). Estimated failure rates at 20 years were 11.4% (CI, +/-4.8) for ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and 11.6% (CI, +/-8,2) for continent ileostomy (P = 0.8). Sixty-five patients who had received an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (21%) and 21 of those who had a continent ileostomy (30%) had one or more salvage procedures. Estimated salvage rates at 20 years were 31% vs. 38%, respectively (P = 0.06). The crude success rates of functioning ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and continent ileostomy were 92.8% and 90.5%, respectively.
Six of eight patients (75%) healed after gracilis muscle transposition alone. The other two patients required a second gracilis. These two patients failed with another recurrence and one of them underwent laparotomy with successful omental interposition. Thus, after a median follow-up of 28 (range, 4-55) months, the per-gracilis muscle transposition healing rate was 60% (6/10) and the overall healing success rate after gracilis muscle transposition and other procedures was 88% (7/8). For patients with Crohn's disease, four of five (80%) presented no recurrent rectovaginal fistula. Seven of eight patients underwent ileostomy closure after gracilis, but two required subsequent stomas, one for a late recurrence. Overall, five of eight patients are stoma-free. Despite healing, postoperative quality of life and sexual activity remained significantly altered.
There were 887 major colorectal procedures assessed. Independent risk factors for mortality were American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status Grades III to V, age, high comorbidity count, and low surgeon case volume. For major morbidity, risk factors were American Society of Anesthesiologists' Grades III to V, urgent operation, and operation to excise the rectum. Overall, mortality was 4.51%, and major morbidity was 19.6%. The estimated risk of mortality was stratified by risk factor profile from 0.12% (95% CI, 0.02-0.93) to 42.4% (95% CI, 23.5-63.9). The risk of major morbidity was stratified from 7.22% (95% CI, 4.82-10.7) to 49.2% (95% CI, 34.2-64.4). Model discrimination was favorable to the existing risk adjustment models applied to our cohort. The Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (including Portsmouth and ColoRectal modifications), and Association of ColoProctology of Great Britain and Ireland Colorectal Cancer models (mortality: area under receiver operating characteristic (AU ROC) curves 0.87 compare 0.70-0.81, major morbidity: 0.69 compare 0.66)).
p53 mutations were observed in 39.7% of proximal, 51.0% of distal, and 46.6% of rectal tumors; Ki-ras mutations were observed in 36.0% of proximal, 26.9% of distal, and 30.5% of rectal tumors. Although 40.9% of proximal tumors were considered CpG island methylator phenotype positive (having two or more of five markers methylated), only 12.9% of distal and 11.9% of rectal tumors were CpG island methylator phenotype positive. Likewise, microsatellite instability was observed in 23.7% of proximal and only 3.8% of distal and 2.0% of rectal tumors. More than 50% of distal colon or rectal tumors had only one acquired mutation, whereas only 35.1% of proximal tumors had one mutation. The most common single mutation for colon and rectal tumors was p53 followed by Ki-ras mutations.
The mean follow-up period was 90.5 months. Overall, 15 (2.2%) of the 697 patients had positive results. Four characteristics were identified as risk factors for exfoliation of cancer cells into the peritoneal cavity: 1) depth of invasion, 2) regional lymph nodes, 3) lymphatic invasion, and 4) venous invasion. In univariate analyses of all 697 patients and the subgroup of 374 patients with pT3 or T4 tumors, patients with positive cytology findings had significantly worse disease-free and cancer-specific survival than patients with negative cytology findings (P &lt; 0.001). On multivariate analysis, peritoneal cytology remained an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival in all patients and in patients with pT3 or pT4 tumors. Only peritoneal cytology was a significant prognostic factor for peritoneal recurrence (P &lt; 0.0001).
Anal pressure data were consistent with rhythmic pressure contractions. Succinylcholine significantly reduced both pressure and electromyography signals. Electromyography amplitude and frequency decreased after nerve transection but not after sphincterotomy. The histology showed that the rat anal anatomy has muscular components that compare with human anatomy. The sphincterotomy group showed injury to the anal sphincters and the sphincter anatomy of the nerve transection group appeared similar to the control group. The anal pressure wave appears to be created by synergistic activity of both striated and smooth muscle of the anal sphincter.
The mean soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 level in patients was significantly higher than that in control subjects. Elevated serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was significantly associated with clinicopathologic parameters such as tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis. In Cox multivariate analysis, distant metastasis and elevated serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 level were independent risk factors predicting poor prognosis. The prognosis for Stage 2 patients positive for soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was comparable to that for Stage 3 patients. In addition, the serum level of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 level was correlated negatively with the cancer tissue level.
Adenomas were detected in 19.3% of experienced physician-only procedures and in 14.9% of procedures with trainee participation. Advanced adenomas were detected in 8.6% of experienced physicians' procedures vs. 4.9% of trainee procedures. Polyp detection was nearly identical in both groups (32% for experienced physicians; 33% for trainees). Trainee participation delayed the procedure by a mean of seven minutes.
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and reported 213 patients with acute complicated diverticulitis managed by laparoscopic lavage. None of these studies were randomized. The patients' mean age was 59 years and most patients had Hinchey Grade 3 disease. All patients were treated with antibiotics and laparoscopic lavage. Conversion to laparotomy was made in six (3%) patients and the mean hospital stay was nine days. Ten percent of the patients had complications. During the mean follow-up of 38 months, 38% of the patients underwent elective sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis.
Specific IgE-antibodies to extracts of common ragweed pollen were present in 10 - 17 % of the tested sera depending on the year of investigation.
CI users demonstrated substantially poorer BKB-SIN scores than NH listeners, as expected; however, their ANL scores were similar to those for NH listeners. BKB-SIN scores and ANL scores were not systematically related to one another. Each measure accounted for more than one third of the variance in CI users' aided APHAB Global scores; together, the two measures accounted for 72% of that variance.
Thresholds elicited with pulsed, warbled, and pulsed-warbled tones did not significantly differ.
Disarticulating the ossicular chain resulted in the appearance of a deep notch in ER in each specimen ranging in center frequency from 561 to 841 Hz. The average reduction in ER was 31% at a frequency of 630 Hz. Laser Doppler vibrometry measurements confirmed the effect of the disarticulation and then repair using ionomeric cement. The low-frequency notch in ER was eliminated following repair of the ossicular chain. There was a small decrease in average high-frequency ER for both the cut and repaired conditions. A simple series impedance model of the middle ear was used to model the change in ER based on changes in middle ear impedance. The primary finding of the modeling was that the low-frequency notch in ER in the disarticulated ear occurs at the resonance frequency at which the reactance goes through zero consistent with the data.
A significant effect of viewing condition was observed for all programs. Participants exhibited significantly better speech recognition scores in conditions with CC than those without CC (p &lt; 0.01). Use of personal HAs did not significantly improve recognition of televised speech compared with the unaided condition. The condition effect was similar across the three different programs. Most of the participants (73%) regularly wore their HAs while watching television; very few of them (13%) had ever used CC.
Our calculations indicate that for a range of proposed benefit and cost estimates, the monetary benefits of both one-step (DPOAE alone) and two-step (DPOAE followed by AABR) NHS programs outweigh programmatic costs. Our calculations indicate that BCR is robust in that it can be applied regardless of the values that are assigned to benefit and cost. Maximum BCR was identified and remained stable regardless of these values; however, it was recognized that the use of maximum BCR could result in reduced test sensitivity and may not be optimal for use in UNHS programs. The inclusion of secondary AABR screening increases BCR but does not alter the DPOAE criterion level at which maximum BCR occurs. The model of middle ear effusion reduces overall DPOAE level, subsequently lowering the DPOAE criterion level at which maximum BCR was obtained
On the speech-in-babble task, benefit of listening with two ears compared with one was greater when going from 3 to 6 mo of experience. This was evident when the target speech and interfering speech were spatially separated, but not when they were presented from the same location. At 3 mo postactivation of bilateral hearing, 82% of subjects demonstrated bilateral benefit when right/left discrimination was evaluated. In contrast, 47% of subjects showed a bilateral benefit when sound localization was evaluated, suggesting that directional hearing might emerge in a two-step process beginning with discrimination and converging on more fine-grained localization. The bilateral speech intelligibility scores were positively correlated with sound localization abilities, so that listeners who were better able to hear speech in babble were generally better able to identify source locations.
For cochlear implant subjects, pitch direction discrimination just-noticeable differences ranged from 1 to 8.0 semitones (Mean = 3.0, SD = 2.3). Melody and timbre recognition ranged from 0 to 94.4% correct (mean = 25.1, SD = 22.2) and 20.8 to 87.5% (mean = 45.3, SD = 16.2), respectively. Each subtest significantly correlated at least moderately with both Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) word recognition scores and spondee recognition thresholds in steady state noise and two-talker babble. Intraclass coefficients demonstrating test-retest correlations for pitch, melody, and timbre were 0.85, 0.92, and 0.69, respectively. Normal-hearing volunteers had a mean pitch direction discrimination threshold of 1.0 semitone, the smallest interval tested, and mean melody and timbre recognition scores of 87.5 and 94.2%, respectively.
Unlike workers who have occupational hearing loss, the professionals in this investigation seem not to experience an inordinate degree of stigmatization in their workplaces, although most believe that hearing loss has negatively affected their job performance. Some of the participants believe that they have lost their "competitive edge," and some believe that they have been denied promotions because of hearing loss. However, most report that they have overcome their hearing-related difficulties by various means, and many have developed a determination and stamina to remain active in the workforce. The majority of the participants seemed to be unfamiliar with the Americans with Disability Act, Public Law 101-336. The overriding theme to emerge is that professionals desire to maintain their competency to perform their jobs and will do what they have to do to "get the job done."
Results showed high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.98) and good construct validity (correlations between the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire and other test measures, including the Speech, Spatial, and Other Qualities, were significant). A preliminary factor analysis revealed scores loaded on three factors, representing the following conditions: localization, speech in noise and music in quiet, and speech in quiet, explaining 64.9, 13.0, and 5.3% of the variance, respectively. Most of the questionnaire items (12/24) loaded onto the first factor that represents the subscale related to source localization. Mean scores on the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire were higher for subjects with bilateral cochlear implants than for subjects with a unilateral cochlear implant, consistent with other research and supporting construct validity.
Incidental findings revealed that musicians had longer P1 latencies for pure tones and smaller P1 amplitudes for harmonic tones than nonmusicians. There were no P1 group differences for speech stimuli. Musicians compared with nonmusicians had shorter MMN latencies for all deviances (harmonic tones, pure tones, and speech). Musicians had shorter P3a latencies to harmonic tones and speech but not to pure tones. MMN and P3a amplitude were modulated by deviant frequency but not by group membership.
The annual mean concentration of the metals from the two cities was generally characterized by the lowest Cd (1.7-9.1 ng m(-3)) and largest Pb (51-341 ng m(-3)). The relative ordering of metal concentration levels from both cities was consistently found as: Pb &gt; Mn &gt; Ni &gt; Cr &gt; Cd. An evaluation of the absolute concentration levels showed that the values derived for both cities generally fell in an intermediate range between highly polluted (e.g., major Chinese cities) and moderately clean urban environments (Japanese or US sites).
Sorption of acetochlor was expressed as the distribution coefficient (K (d)). K (d) values slightly decreased as the initial acetochlor concentration increased. These values indicated that acetochlor was moderately sorbed by soils and sediments. Highly significant correlations between the K (d) values and the organic carbon content were observed at both initial concentrations. However, sorption of acetochlor was most closely correlated to the humic acid carbon, and less to the fulvic acid carbon. The total organic carbon content was found to also significantly influence acetochlor desorption.
The chemical analysis of the toluene extracts indicated slow degradation rates and the CALUX assay indicated high levels of AhR agonists in the same extracts. Compared to day 0, the bioavailable fractions showed no decrease in AhR agonist activity during the treatment but rather an up-going trend, which was supported by increasing levels of PAHs and an increased effect in the Comet bioassay after 274 days. The bio-TEQs calculated using the CALUX assay were higher than the TEQs calculated from chemical analysis in both extracts, indicating that there are additional toxic PAHs in both extracts that are not included in the chemically derived TEQ.
Cetirizine, acrivastine and fexofenadine were detected in both influent and effluent wastewater samples at concentration levels ranging from about 80 to 220 ng/L, while loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine could not be detected in any samples. During sewage treatment, the concentration of the antihistamines dropped by an average of 16-36%. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of antihistamines were observed in samples collected during the season of most intensive plant pollen production, i.e. in May. In the river water samples, the relative pattern of occurrence of cetirizine, acrivastine and fexofenadine was similar to that in the wastewater samples; although the concentration of the compounds was substantially lower (4-11 ng/L). The highest concentrations of the studied drugs were observed near the discharging point of the sewage treatment plant.
The MMI surface map shows high values in strongly industrialized and urbanized regions as well as at sites of high altitude, lying, for example in the Massif Central and the French Alps. Accordingly, the CHAID decision tree consequently shows the altitude to be the statistically most significant influencing factor of the MMI followed by the sampled moss species. As for the MMI map, the surface map for Cu mirrors urban agglomerations, as high values can be found in the areas of Greater Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The CHAID tree for Cu revealed the sampled moss species and the ratio of urban land uses within 5 km of the sampling sites to be the main influencing factors.
There are two main results. Firstly, it was worked out that the epistemic cultures involved in the GMO-debate use rather distinct strategies to define non-knowledge and to classify evidence. There are three types of constructing evidence, which correspond to different types of epistemic cultures. Secondly, the findings imply that the intensity of the conflicts in risk policy fields like the GMO-debate is due to a lack of knowledge politics. Usually, knowledge politics is restricted to the design of institutional procedures to compile knowledge provided by experts. The institutional setting of risk analysis and risk management is based on the premise of strict separation between knowledge and power. However, inadmissible mixing-up of knowledge and power is observable.
Treatment with HYP resulted in the formation of AOX. The percentage conversion of HYP to AOX was up to 11%. Most important identified DBPs in viticulture are chloroform, dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetaldehyde. In addition, the formation of carbon tetrachloride (CT), 1,1,1-trichloropropanone, 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and 2-chloro-/2,4-dichlorophenylacetic acid was investigated. It was demonstrated that reaction temperature, concentration of HYP and type of organic matter have important influence on the formation of chlorinated DBPs.
Each of the non-estrogenic chemicals reduced the apparent estrogenicity of both single estrogens and their mixtures if applied at high, toxic concentrations. Besides this common pattern, a highly substance- and concentration-dependent impact of the non-estrogenic toxicants was observable. The activity of 17ss-estradiol was still reduced in the presence of only low or non-toxic concentrations of 2,4-dinitroaniline and cycloheximide, which was not the case for mercury and DMSO. A clear synergistic modulation, i.e. an enhanced estrogenic activity, was induced by the presence of slightly toxic concentrations of LAS-12. The joint estrogenic activity of the mixture of estrogens was affected by toxic masking and synergistic modulation in direct proportion to the single estrogens, which allowed for an adequate adaptation of concentration addition and thus unaffected predictability of the joint estrogenicity in the presence of non-estrogenic confounders.
Due to the fact that urbanization has become a global process shaping the earth and that the urban systems are globally cross-linked among each other, a new geoscientific sphere has to be introduced: the astysphere. This sphere comprises the parts of the earth influenced by urban systems. Accepting urbanization as global ongoing process forming the astysphere comprehensively copes with the growing importance of urbanization on the creation of present geologic formations.
Vascular inflow was reestablished and the limb was salvaged.
The study included 15 patients. Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed by coronary angiography and ventriculography. Cardiac MRI was performed within 24 h of admission. Endomyocardial biopsies were taken during the acute phase and after recovery. The content of fibrosis was determined by immunohistochemical staining of collagen-1. In the acute phase, cardiac MRI revealed LGE in five patients. This was completely reversed at follow-up [14, inter-quartile range (IQR) 11-14.5 days]. All patients showed a significant increase of collagen-1 compared with control tissue. Moreover, the amount of collagen-1 was significantly higher in LGE positive patients (LGE positive: 18.84, IQR 13.82-19.75 AU/microm(2); LGE negative: 7.57, IQR 5.41-9.19 AU/microm(2), P = 0.001). The presence of LGE was not associated with poorer left ventricular function.
We measured left heart dimensions of 25 healthy twin pairs with a 1.5T MR scanner, analysed with the mass, Medis Software. We performed heritability analysis and tests for genetic influences shared between cardiac structures. We found that CMR-based heritability estimates (h(2) = 84%) substantially exceeded estimates based on echocardiography. We also found significant genetic influence on papillary muscle mass (h(2) = 82%). Bivariate analysis of papillary and LV muscle mass revealed significant genetic influences shared by both phenotypes (genetic correlation 0.59) and suggested an additional genetic component specific to papillary muscle. We observed correlations between body mass index, surface area, and systolic blood pressure with cardiac dimensions, even in this small study. Environmental influences were relevant as well, indicating reciprocal influences on papillary vs. LV muscle mass.
Prevalence and depth of coronary artery bridges (CBs) were assessed in 255 hearts, including 115 with HCM (median age 29, range 5-90; 75% male), and 140 controls. Coronary artery bridges were more common in HCM (47/115; 41%) than in patients who died of a variety of non-HCM-related causes (21/100; 21%; P = 0.002), or in patients with congenital aortic stenosis and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (5/40; 12%; P = 0.001). Among the HCM hearts, CBs were present in 33 of 77 patients (43%) with sudden death, in 10 of 27 (37%) with heart failure death (or heart transplantation), and in 4 of 11 (36%) with other modes of death (P = 0.826). Deeply embedded CBs (&gt; or =2 mm) occurred with similar frequency in HCM patients with sudden (21 of 77; 27%) or heart failure death (5 of 27; 13%; P = 0.191). In sudden death patients, the presence of CB was unrelated to gender (33% in women and 45% in men, P = 0.406) and age (41% &lt;18 years vs. 44% &gt; or =18 years; P = 0.827).
Perioperative ECGs, creatinine kinase MB fraction, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were assessed in 545 primary CABG patients. None of the ECG criteria for myocardial injury predicted mortality or HLOS. However, post-operative day (POD) 1 cTnI levels independently predicted 5-year mortality (hazard ratio = 1.42; 95% CI 1.14-1.76 for each 10 microg/L increase; P = 0.009), while adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and perioperative risk factors. Moreover, cTnI was the only biomarker that significantly improved the prediction of 5-year mortality estimated by the logistic Euroscore (P = 0.02). Furthermore, the predictive value of cTnI for 5-year mortality was replicated in a separately collected cohort of 1031 CABG patients using cardiac troponin T.
PREAMI included 1252 post-AMI patients (age 73 +/- 6 years, LV ejection fraction 59.1 +/- 7.7%) receiving optimal therapy after AMI, randomized to perindopril 8 mg/day (n = 631) or placebo (n = 621); n = 896 had complete echo-Doppler data. Outcome measures were clinical [death, heart failure (HF)] and standard echo-Doppler parameters. Pre-discharge LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) was similar: 81.1 +/- 23.1 (perindopril) and 79.6 +/- 22.7 mL (placebo). At 6 months and 1 year, LVEDV remained unchanged with perindopril (81.2 +/- 24.4 and 81.8 +/- 26.8 mL, respectively), but increased with placebo (83.0 +/- 25.3 and 83.6 +/- 25.7 mL, respectively, both P &lt; 0.001 vs. baseline). Perindopril reduced cardiac sphericity vs. placebo (P = 0.015 at 6 months; P = 0.020 at 1 year). Classification regression tree analysis showed treatment as the most important predictor of remodelling. Multiple pre-discharge echocardiographic variables predicted the death/HF endpoint, independently of treatment (P &lt; or = 0.05).
All hearts were exposed to 30 min regional ischaemia followed by 120-(isolated hearts) or 180-(in situ hearts) min reperfusion. BAY-58 (1-50 nM) infused for 60 min starting 5 min before reperfusion significantly reduced infarction from 33.0 +/- 3.2% in control isolated rabbit hearts to 9.5-12.7% (P &lt; 0.05). In a more clinically relevant in situ rabbit model, infarct size was similarly reduced with a loading dose of 53.6 microg/kg followed by a 60 min infusion of 1.25 microg/kg/min (41.1 +/- 3.1% infarction in control hearts to 16.0 +/- 4.4% in treated hearts, P &lt; 0.05). BAY-58 similarly decreased infarction in the isolated rat heart, and protection was abolished by co-treatment with a protein kinase G (PKG) antagonist, or a mitochondrial K(ATP) channel antagonist. Conversely, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester-hydrochloride, a NO-synthase inhibitor, failed to block BAY-58's ability to decrease infarction, consistent with the latter's putative NO-independent activation of PKG. Finally, BAY-58 increased myocardial cGMP content in reperfused hearts while cAMP was unchanged.
The EVEREST trial randomized 4133 patients hospitalized for worsening HF and low ejection fraction (&lt; or =40%) to tolvaptan, a vasopressin antagonist, or placebo. Following discharge, BW was assessed at 1, 4, and 8 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. A time-dependent Cox proportional Hazard model explored the relationship between change in BW at 60, 120, and 180 days from discharge and the risks of HF hospitalization, cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. For subjects re-hospitalized for heart failure at 60, 120, and 180 days after discharge, mean BW increase prior to the event was 1.96, 2.07, and 1.97 kg, respectively, compared with 0.74, 0.90, and 1.04 kg in patients without re-hospitalization (P &lt; 0.001 all groups). A similar pattern was observed with CV hospitalization. However, increases in BW were not predictive of all-cause mortality.
The T111I variant was genotyped in case-control studies of CHD nested within the Diet, Cancer, and Health study with 998 cases, Nurses' Health Study with 241 cases, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study with 262 cases. The minor allele frequency in the combined pool of controls was 0.29. The T111I variant was not associated with HDL-C or any other lipid and lipoprotein measures. Compared with wildtype homozygotes, the pooled estimate for risk of CHD was 0.95 (0.85-1.06) per T111I allele.
Personal exposures to PM(10), PM(2.5), and PM(0.25) was measured over 24 h in 39 patients (36 males, 3 females; mean age 60.3 years) with prior myocardial infarction (&gt;6 months). Simultaneously, a 24 h ECG was recorded and then analysed for HRV and ventricular arrhythmias. Breath condensate and blood samples also were collected at the end of monitoring to measure several indexes of inflammation. Negative correlation was found between HRV and exposure to PM(0.25) in a group of patients not taking beta-blockers. More severe ventricular arrhythmias were observed at the highest concentrations of PM(10) and PM(2.5). Indexes of inflammation in either breath condensate or blood did not correlate with PM exposures.
We screened the promoter region of human calmodulin III gene (CALM3) and identified a new -34T&gt;A polymorphism with a T-allele frequency of 0.70. The distribution of CALM3 genotypes differed in 180 unrelated FHC patients carrying a known FHC mutation compared with 134 controls, with higher TT-genotype frequency (0.73 vs. 0.51) and lower frequencies of AT- (0.24 vs. 0.37) and AA genotypes (0.03 vs. 0.11; P = 0.0005). To study whether the -34T&gt;A polymorphism could play a modifier role, patients' relatives including both affected and healthy carriers were added. Affected carriers had a 0.56 times higher odds of carrying a T allele than healthy carriers (P = 0.053). We then investigated whether the -34T&gt;A polymorphism affects the promoter activity using luciferase reporter vectors containing either CALM3-T or CALM3-A promoters. The activity of CALM3-T was lower than CALM3-A in HEK293 cells (1.00 +/- 0.19 vs. 2.31 +/- 0.13, P = 0.00001) and in cardiomyocytes (0.96 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.33 +/- 0.08, P = 0.00727).
The CAPTIM study included 840 patients managed in a pre-hospital setting within 6 h of an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized to either a primary angioplasty (n = 421) or a pre-hospital fibrinolysis (rt-PA) with immediate transfer to a centre with interventional facilities (n = 419). Long-term follow-up was obtained in blinded fashion from 795 patients (94.6%). Using an intent-to-treat analysis, all-cause mortality at 5 years was 9.7% in the pre-hospital fibrinolysis group when compared with 12.6% in the primary angioplasty group [HR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.50-1.14); P = 0.18]. For patients included within 2 h, 5 year mortality was 5.8% in the pre-hospital fibrinolysis group when compared with 11.1% in the primary angioplasty group [HR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25-0.97); P = 0.04], whereas it was, respectively, 14.5 and 14.4% in patients included after 2 h [HR 1.02, (95% CI 0.59-1.75), P = 0.92].
In 454 patients undergoing PCI, acetylcholine (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) was infused in a coronary segment without significant CAD. Changes in coronary diameter were measured and an intravascular ultrasound examination (IVUS) was performed. On top of statin therapy, patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to placebo or nifedipine GITS 30-60 mg/day and followed for 18-24 months. Blood pressure was lower on nifedipine than on placebo by 5.8/2.1 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001) as was total and LDL cholesterol (4.8 mg/dL; P = 0.495), while HDL was higher (3.6 mg/dL; P = 0.026). In the most constricting segment, nifedipine reduced vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (14.0% vs. placebo 7.7%; P &lt; 0.0088). The percentage change in plaque volume with nifedipine and placebo, respectively, was 1.0 and 1.9%, ns.
Apical two- and four-chamber views (A2C and A4C) and real-time 3D datasets (Toshiba Artida 4D System) obtained in 43 patients with a wide range of LV size and function were analysed to measure LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (ESV and EDV) using 2D and 3D-STE techniques. Short-axis CMR images (Siemens 1.5T scanner) acquired on the same day were analysed to obtain ESV and EDV reference values using the method of disks approximation. Reproducibility of both STE techniques was assessed using repeated measurements. While 2D-STE correlated well with CMR (r: 0.72-0.88), it underestimated LV volumes with relatively large biases (10-30 mL) and wide limits of agreement (SD: 36-51 mL), with A2C-derived measurements being worse than A4C values. The 3D-STE measurements showed higher correlation with CMR (0.87-0.92), and importantly smaller biases (1-16 mL) and narrower limits of agreement (SD: 28-37 mL). In addition, 3D-STE showed lower inter- and intra-observer variability (11-14% and 12-13%), than 2D-STE (16-17% and 12-16%, respectively).
Since 1996, all patients with ischaemic heart disease, receiving ICD therapy for secondary prevention of sudden death, were included in the current study. Patients were evaluated at implantation and during long-term follow-up. A total of 456 patients were included in the analysis and followed for 54 +/- 35 months. During follow-up, 100 (22%) patients died and ICD therapy was noted in 216 (47%) patients, of which 138 (30%) for fast, potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Multivariate analysis revealed a history of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF), ventricular tachycardia as presenting arrhythmia, and wide QRS and poor left ventricular ejection fraction as independent predictors of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The strongest predictor was AF with a hazard ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.3-3.2). On the basis of the available clinical data, it was not possible to identify a group which exhibited no risk on recurrence of potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Intelligibility, articulation, and nasal resonance were best predicted by vowel space and /k/. Within patients, /k/ and /x/ differentiated tumor site and stage. Various objective speech parameters were related to speech problems as reported by patients.
The C1R-CD1d cell line was highly susceptible to specific CD1d-restricted T cell cytotoxicity in the presence alpha-GalCer in vitro. After adoptive transfer of CD1d-restricted T cells and alpha-GalCer to mice engrafted with both C1R-CD1c and C1R-CD1d, a reduction in tumor growth was observed only in CD1d(+) masses. In addition, CD1d-restricted T-cell treatment plus alpha-GalCer eradicated small C1R-CD1d(+) nodules. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that infiltrating NKT cells were mainly observed in CD1d nodules.
Of 452 acute leukemia patients, 21 cases (4.6%) were diagnosed as biphenotypic acute leukemia. Among them, 14 (66.7%) were B lymphoid and myeloid, 5 (23.8%) were T lymphoid and myeloid, one (4.8%) was T/B lymphoid and one (4.8%) was trilineage differentiation. When compared with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia showed significantly higher incidence of CD34 antigen expression, unfavorable karyotypes, and extramedullary infiltration (p&lt;0.05). In this cohort of patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia, t(9;22) was the most common abnormality in chromosome structure. The median disease-free survival and overall survival in biphenotypic acute leukemia patients was five months and ten months, respectively, significantly shorter than those in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (p&lt;0.05).
Acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with significantly higher numbers of natural killer cells and donor-derived effector CD4 T cells (CD45RO(+) CD27(-)) early (day 30) after transplantation (p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively). This association was evident before the emergence of clinical pathology in six out of seven patients. Although numbers of regulatory CD4 T cells (CD25(high) Foxp3(+)) were similar at day 30 in all patients, a significant deficit in those who developed acute graft-versus-host disease was apparent relative to effector CD4 T cells (median of 41 effectors per regulatory cell compared to 12 to 1 for patients without graft-versus-host disease) (p=0.03). By day 180, a functional regulatory CD4 T-cell population had expanded significantly in patients who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease, reversing the imbalance (median of 3 effectors per regulatory cell compared to 9.6 to 1 for patients without graft-versus-host disease) (p=0.018) suggesting no overt absence of immune regulation in the late onset form of the disease.
Patients with essential thrombocythemia had significantly higher numbers of circulating annexin V-positive microparticles than controls (median 4500 vs. 2500x10(6) events/L; p=0.039), including significantly higher numbers of microparticles positive for the platelet marker CD61 (p=0.043), the endothelial markers CD62E (p=0.009) and CD144 (p=0.021), and for tissue factor (p=0.036). CD62E was co-expressed with the platelet marker CD41 on microparticles, suggesting a bilineage origin of such microparticles, which were observed only in patients with risk factors for thrombosis. Patients with essential thrombocythemia had higher plasma levels of mature von Willebrand factor (p=0.045) but similar propeptide levels compared to controls. In thrombin generation analyses, microparticle-rich plasma from patients with essential thrombocythemia had a shorter lag time (p=0.001) and higher peak height (p=0.038) than plasma from controls. Peak height correlated significantly with the total number of microparticles (R=0.634, p&lt;0.001).
We observed that naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells are resistant to the pro-apoptotic effect of bortezomib. Furthermore, we found that long-term culture of CD4(+) T cells in the presence of bortezomib promotes the emergence of a regulatory T-cell population that significantly inhibits proliferation, IFN-gamma production and CD40L expression among stimulated effector T cells.
Treatment with flavopiridol resulted in growth inhibition of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, along with accumulation of subG(1) cells and disappearance of S phase without cell cycle arrest. Consistent with flavopiridol activity, phosphorylation at cdk2, cdk4, cdk9 sites on RB and RNA polymerase II was inhibited. This correlated with induction of cell death through rapid mitochondrial damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and transcripts. Notably, flavopiridol was less active in ALK-positive cells, as apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations and later time points, and resistance to treatment was observed in cells maintaining NPM-ALK signaling. NPM-ALK inhibition affected proliferation but not survival of anaplastic large cell lym-phoma cells, whereas it resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis when combined with flavopiridol.
We demonstrated that phenoxodiol inhibited plasma membrane electron transport and cell proliferation (IC(50) 46 microM and 5.4 microM, respectively) and promoted apoptosis of rapidly proliferating human T cells but did not affect resting T cells. Phenoxodiol also induced apoptosis in T cells stimulated in HLA-mismatched allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. Conversely, non-proliferating T cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction remained viable and could be restimulated in a third party mixed lymphocyte reaction, in the absence of phenoxodiol. In addition, we demonstrated that leukemic blasts from patients with primary acute myeloid leukemia (n=22) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=8) were sensitive to phenoxodiol. The lymphocytic leukemic blasts were more sensitive than the myeloid leukemic blasts to 10 muM phenoxodiol exposure for 24h (viability of 23+/-4% and 64+/-5%, respectively, p=0.0002).
Dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia was diagnosed at presentation in 22 cases and at relapse or disease progression in 5 cases. At the time of diagnosis of dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia, extranodal involvement was found in 25 cases (93%) and central nervous system involvement occurred in 15 cases (56%). The median survival and 1-year survival rate of the 27 cases were only 6 months and 22%, respectively, after diagnosis of the dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia. Seven cases of triple-hit lymphoma/leukemia (dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia with 3q27/BCL6 translocation) were included; the median survival of these patients was only 4 months from the diagnosis of the dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia. The duration of survival of the patients with a triple-hit malignancy was shorter than that of the other 20 cases of dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia (p=0.02). The translocation partner of MYC subdivided the dual-hit cases into two groups; 14 cases of IGH and 13 cases of IGK/L. The MIB-1 index was investigated in 14 cases with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and was higher in the group with MYC-IGH translocation (n=7) than in the MYC-IGK/L group (n=7) (p=0.02). Overall survival was not different between the MYC-IGH translocation group (n=14) and the MYC-IGK or MYC-IGL translocation group (n=13).
Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin activity, with the pharmacological inhibitor rapamycin, dramatically reduced hematopoietic progenitor expansion, without altering levels of apoptosis or maturation. Moreover, analysis of distinct hematopoietic progenitor populations revealed that rapamycin treatment inhibited the expansion potential of committed CD34(+) lineage-positive progenitors, but did not affect early hematopoietic progenitors. Further examinations showed that these effects of rapamycin on progenitor expansion might involve differential regulation of protein kinase B and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling.
Fibrosis area was significantly correlated with fibrosis stage as assessed by the Metavir score (rho = 0.733, P &lt; 0.0001). The optimal cut-off value of fibrosis area was 1.6% for F &gt; or = 2, 3.1% for F &gt; or = 3, and 3.8-6.4% for F4. LS was significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (rho = 0.734, P &lt; 0.0001). The optimal cut-off value of LS was 7.1 kPa for F &gt; or = 2, 9.6 kPa for F &gt; or = 3 and 11.6-16.9 kPa for F4. Multiple linear regression analysis selected fibrosis area (P = 0.0002), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P = 0.0237), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GTP) (P = 0.0114), prothrombin time (P = 0.0114) and hyaluronic acid (P &lt; 0.0001) as factors correlating with LS.
The most significantly associated markers for HCV positivity were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Optimal limits of ALT and AST by receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis were 24 and 27 IU (male, 33 and 28 IU; female, 22 and 26 IU), respectively. However, one-quarter of HCV carriers were not found to be positive using the optimal limits of aminotransferases.
Higher HBV DNA levels, subgenotype B1/Bj, A1762T/G1764A, G1896A, G1899A and A2339G mutation were significantly more frequent (P &lt; 0.05), while hepatitis B e-antigen was less frequent in the FH-T patients than AHB. In multivariate analysis, G1896A mutation (odds ratio [OR], 13.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.75-66.64), serum HBV DNA more than 5.23 log copies/mL (OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.10-24.15) and total bilirubin more than 10.35 mg/mL (OR, 7.81; 95% CI, 1.77-34.51) were independently associated with a fulminant outcome by transient HBV infection. On the other hand, in comparison with the patients between FH-C and AE-C groups, there was no significant difference of virological factors associated with the development of FHB.
HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 and mixed genotypes were detected in 55.2, 13.7, 18.9, 0.9 and 11.3% of patients, respectively, in contrast to the fact that only genotypes 1 and 2 are detected in HCV mono-infected patients in Japan. This is compatible with the transmission of HCV through imported blood products contaminated by HCV. Sixteen of 297 HIV-HCV co-infected patients had advanced liver disease accompanied by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or hepatocellular carcinoma. The average age of such patients was 41.1 +/- 14.0 years, which was much younger than that of HCV mono-infected patients with the same complications. The progression speed of liver disease estimated from the changes in the levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, or platelet was slower in patients who achieved sustained virological response with interferon treatment than in those who did not receive it. The overall sustained virological response rate to interferon treatment was 43.3%.
Baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar. Both groups experienced a significant decrease of BMI with no difference between them. However, visceral fat decreased significantly more in the colestimide group (P = 0.046). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) showed a significantly greater decrease in the colestimide group compared with the control group (P = 0.042). In patients with moderate to severe histological steatosis, there were significant differences between the two groups regard to HbA(1c), transaminases, and hyaluronic acid (P = 0.018 for HbA(1c), P = 0.003 for AST, P = 0.042 for alanine aminotransferase, and P = 0.042 for hyaluronic acid). Steatosis significantly improved in patients in the colestimide group who had fatty liver on CT (P = 0.049). In the colestimide group, abdominal distension and/or constipation were seen, but mostly tolerable, no other clinical or laboratory adverse events associated with the use of this medicine were not observed.
The -1993C allele in the TBX21 promoter was significantly more common among chronic HBV carriers compared with recovered controls (chi(2) = 6.65, P = 0.01). In contrast, the frequency of TT haplotype at positions -1993/-1514, was significantly higher in recovered controls than chronic HBV carriers (P = 0.0027, odds ratio = 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.12). In HBV carriers, the TBX21 promoter polymorphisms were not linked to disease progression.
Twenty-five (13.8%) patients developed ischemic hepatitis. In-hospital mortality was 57% (103 patients). In the ischemic hepatitis group, mortality increased up to 84.0% (21 patients) compared with 52.6% (82 patients) in patients without ischemic hepatitis (control group) (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-14.4; P = 0.003). The development of ischemic hepatitis, age, maximum SOFA score and inadequate antibiotic therapy were independently associated with an increased risk of death. The odds of death increased by 247% in ischemic hepatitis (OR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.02-11.8; P = 0.047).
Cirrhotic monocytes spontaneously produced six proteins (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, RANTES and Gro), whereas normal monocytes produced only small amounts of IL-8 and RANTES. Analyses with the online gene set analysis toolkit WebGestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt) found enrichment for the six proteins in the human gene ontology subcategory (http://www.geneontology.org), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) and BioCarta pathways (http://www.biocarta.com/genes/index.asp) consistent with a proinflammatory phenotype of cirrhotic monocytes resulting from activated TLR signaling. Interestingly, LPS-elicited TLR engagement further increased the production of the six proteins and did not induce the secretion of any others, in particular the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. LPS-stimulated normal monocytes produced TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, RANTES, Gro and IL-10.
After 2-week feeding of MCD diet, hepatic steatosis was enhanced and plasma alanine aminotransferase elevated in KO mice than in WT mice. In KO mice liver, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances increased, glutathione levels decreased, and mRNA expression levels of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase-1) downregulated. Adenovirus-mediated adiponectin expression prevented these changes in KO mice. Moreover, Kupffer cell infiltration was enhanced and mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage markers (interleukin-10, arginase-1) were decreased in KO mice liver. In the in vitro study, adiponectin significantly increased catalase gene expression in Hepa 1-6 cells.
Rectal varices were detected by Doppler color flow imaging in all eleven patients before treatments. Blood flowvelocity in the rectal varices ranged from 5.7-11.6 cm/s (mean 8.6 cm/s). Rectal varices were observed in all patients by colonoscopy; enlarged, tortuous large varices with red color sign in nine and enlarged, tortuous large varices without red color in two. Seven days after EIS or PSE, CDU showed an extreme decrease in blood flow in all eleven rectal varices, compared to values before EIS or PSE.
Children with high- and low-normal BMI had similar age (8.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.7 years) and height (-2.0 +/- 0.1 vs. -2.2 +/- 0.2 SDS). However, children with high-normal BMI exhibited higher mean basal IGF-I (191 +/- 15 vs. 139 +/- 11 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.05), higher mean IGF-I levels 24 h after GH administration (261 +/- 22 vs. 164 +/- 14 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.05) and a higher IGF-I percent increase after GH administration (37 +/- 5 vs. 17 +/- 4%, p &lt; 0.05) compared with children with normal-low BMI.
The -1245 A allele was identified as a marker-allele for the well-known -841(CA)(n)/non-192 bp allele, both part of haplotype 2. The -1245 A allele was not associated with head circumference at birth, but was associated with a postnatal 0.3 SDS smaller head circumference at age 1-3. The -1245 A allele was also associated with a 1-week shorter gestational age which explained the association with a smaller absolute birth size. No associations were found with gestational age-adjusted birth size, height and weight SDS during postnatal life and with growth during GH treatment.
There was no association between the 4 common polymorphisms of HSD11B1 and type 2 diabetes. g.-19835G&gt;A and g.-19609A&gt;G showed modest associations with fasting plasma glucose and body mass index but the significance of these associations was lost after adjustment for multiple comparison. With regard to promoter polymorphisms in the HSD11B1 gene, a haplotype construct carrying both g.-19835A and g.-19609G showed significantly decreased promoter activity compared to other common haplotype constructs.
Type 1 diabetic patients had significantly low visfatin levels compared with controls (18.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 20.2 +/- 0.3 ng/ml; p &lt; 0.0001). Visfatin levels were comparable between patients with a short duration of diabetes (&lt;10 years) and patients with a long duration of diabetes (&gt;or=10 years) (18.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 18.2 +/- 2.0 ng/ml; p &gt; 0.05). There was a significant correlation between visfatin and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) even after the adjustment for age, sex, body mass index and duration of diabetes (r = -0.48, p = 0.005) in the patient group. Multivariate analysis showed that significant determinants of visfatin concentrations were HbA1c and duration of diabetes (r(2) = 0.27).
At baseline the SGA group displayed higher fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide serum levels and higher HOMA2-IR (p &lt; 0.01) than GHD patients despite similar low muscle mass and less fat mass. Both groups had low muscle mass for height, and mean changes in muscle, fat, insulin, C-peptide and HOMA2-IR during GH treatment were also similar. HOMA2-IR correlated positively with IGF-1 changes in both groups. In the SGA group, but not in the GHD group, the increase in fasting serum insulin, C-peptide and HOMA2-IR correlated negatively with increase in muscle mass (R(2) = 0.32, p &lt; 0.001) and decrease in fat mass (R(2) = 0.12, p = 0.034).
Mean nocturnal leptin area under the curve exhibited a significant increase (2.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 11.2 +/- 2.6 ng/ml h, p &lt; 0.05), whereas that for mean insulin showed a slight decrease, which did not reach statistical significance after administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex.
The F:M ratio in group A was 3.0, which is significantly (p &lt; 0.001) lower than that (10.3) found in group B patients. The F:M ratio of group A1 prepubertal children was lower (1.6) and significantly different from that of pubertal (6.7, p &lt; 0.01) and adult patients (10.3, p &lt; 0.0001). This phenomenon was more evident in hypothyroid as compared to euthyroid CAT.
The prepubertal and pubertal GHD-1 and GHD-2 children had low baseline IGF-I values but their peak IGF-I values during the IGF-I gen reached those of the controls. The percent increase of IGF-I during the test was greater in the GHD groups than in the controls; in the prepubertal groups: 516+/-58% in the GHD-1, 433+/-50% in the GHD-2, 106+/-12% in the NS, and 102+/-18% in the SS (p=0.001); in the pubertal groups: 191+/-28% in the GHD-1, 141+/-20% in the GHD-2, 48+/-8% in the NS, and 61+/-17% in the SS (p=0.003).
The plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in group HD Exer/before patients were higher than those in group HDbefore (20.39+/-5.82 and 1449.19+/-553.41 vs 17.68+/-5.36 and 1295.10+/-384.43 pg/ml, p=0.044 and p=0.067, respectively), while the plasma levels of TXB2 were lower in HD Exer/before patients compared to HDbefore(499.76+/-67.51 vs 608.01+/-80.23 pg/ml, p=0.041). The plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in group HD Exer/after patients were significantly higher compared to those in HDafter patients (23.01+/-5.70 and 1618.19+/-435.07 vs 16.57+/-4.97 and 1005.44+/-317.16 pg/ml, p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.040, respectively). However, significantly lower values in the plasma levels of TXB2 in HD Exer/after compared to HDafter patients (363.10+/-51.91 vs 439.75+/-62.34 pg/ml, p=0.030) were detected. As expected, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha values were lower in C than in the groups of patients with CKD.
Operative time, complication rates, hospital length of stay, Body Mass Index (BMI), % of Excess Weight Loss (EWL) and appetite were evaluated. There were six females and nine males, aged (mean+/-SD) 40.5+/-10.5 yrs and preoperative BMI 47.8+/-7.5 kg/m2. The operative time was 147.7+/-43.2 min. There was one conversion to open surgery and one gastric leak with haemorrhage that led to gastric tube stenosis, ultimately requiring revision surgery. All patients, except these two, were discharged on the 2nd postoperative day after an upper GI series and the initiation of a clear liquid diet. At the follow-up (7.5+/-4.4 months post operatively), the % EWL was 35.7+/-10.1. Eight patients who received regular postoperative dietician counselling at follow-up did better than the others who did not (% EWL 40.4+/-3.8 vs 30.2+/-4.1, respectively). All patients reported significant loss of appetite.
Patients in Asia (n = 4678), Latin America (n = 6090) and the Middle East and Africa (n = 4248) made a mean (SD) of 3.4 (6.9), 5.4 (6.7) and 2.5 (4.4) General Practitioner visits per year. The mean (SD) number of inpatient days amounted to 3.8 (18.1), 2.2 (13.9) and 2.6 (13.5) per year. Results of the regression analysis showed the major influence of diabetes-related complications and inadequate glycaemic control on resource use. The expected annual rate of hospitalisation of patients with macrovascular complications compared with those without was 4.7 times greater in Asia [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 4.7, 95% CI: 2.8-7.8, n = 2551], 5.4 times greater in Latin America (IRR = 5.4, 95% CI: 3.0-9.8, n = 3228) and 4.4 times greater in the Middle East and Africa (IRR = 4.4, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9, n = 2630).
Patients were classified based on initial OAD regimen: metformin (MET) (n = 22,203; 41.3%), sulphonylurea (SFU) (n = 18,439; 34.3%), thiazolidinedione (TZD) (n = 7663; 14.3%), SFU + MET (n = 5467; 10.2%) and TZD + MET (n = 2355; 4.2%). A total of 51.5% of patients had HbA(1c) testing during 90 days preceding OAD initiation through regimen completion. Approximately, 65% of MET and 58% of SFU patients had no titration of initial regimen. Patients demonstrating inadequate glucose control decreased from 68.5% at baseline to 46.9% within 90 days of regimen initiation. Multivariable logistic regression indicated several negative predictors of HbA(1c) testing, including SFU use, age 65+ years, moderate insurance copayment and preindex inpatient utilisation. Multivariable logistic regression of variables associated with reduced likelihood of up-titration included TZD, SFU + MET, or TZD + MET treatment, age 18-34 years, Medicare insurance and any preindex healthcare utilisation.
Hypertension, coronary heart disease and heart failure were more frequent in the RAS group. Cardioversion from AF was more successful in the RAS group than in the non-RAS group (%92 vs. %82, p = 0.026). The rate of ARAF was lower in RAS group compared with that in non-RAS group (17% vs. 31%, p = 0.026). In multivariate analysis, pretreatment with RAS blockers in addition to shock number and enlarged left atrium, independently predicted ARAF (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.75, p = 0.008). Independent predictors of cardioversion success were shock number and left atrial dilatation, but not use of RAS blocker.
Of the initial 232 patients who underwent MRI 72% were diagnosed with AD. 89% of AD patients had CVD findings reported on MRI. Moderate-to-severe CVD was present in 47% of patients. None of the AD patients satisfied a diagnosis of vascular dementia. There was no significant relationship observed between level of MRI CVD findings and scores on NPI (p = 0.57), GDS (p = 0.26) and BADL (p = 0.46). The level of CVD severity did not appear to influence frontal lobe and parkinsonian assessments (p = 0.60).
Atomoxetine was a cost-effective treatment across the whole ADHD population, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from pound 11,500 to pound 15,900 per QALY, compared with alternative pharmacotherapies, which are within UK and rest of Europe acceptability limits. Higher utility values achieved treating ADHD with atomoxetine, compensate for the relatively higher acquisition cost compared with stimulants.
Of the 909 enrollees, 355/471 (75.4%) of PPS+ patients and 363/438 (82.9%) of PPS- patients completed the study (p = 0.006). PPS+ patients improved less than PPS- patients on depression, pain and quality of life measures during the study (HAMD(17) p &lt; 0.001, CGI-S p &lt; 0.001, VAS p = 0.008 and EQ-5D p = 0.004). Fewer PPS+ patients (46.5%) achieved remission compared with PPS- patients (69.4%, p &lt; 0.001).
A total of 203 potentially relevant articles were identified. In all, 29 RCTs were further evaluated; 22 of them (75.8%) investigated the use of balneotherapy in rheumatological diseases and eight osteoarthritis, six fibromyalgia, four ankylosing spondylitis, four rheumatoid arthritis and three RCTs (10.3%) in other musculoskeletal system diseases (chronic low back pain). In addition, three relevant studies focused on psoriasis and one on Parkinson's disease. A total of 1720 patients with rheumatological and other musculoskeletal diseases were evaluated in these studies. Balneotherapy did result in more pain improvement (statistically different) in patients with rheumatological diseases and chronic low back pain in comparison to the control group in 17 (68%) of the 25 RCTs examined. In the remaining eight studies, pain was improved in the balneotherapy treatment arm, but this improvement was statistically not different than that of the comparator treatment arm(s). This beneficial effect lasted for different periods of time: 10 days in one study, 2 weeks in one study, 3 weeks in one study, 12 weeks in 2 studies, 3 months in 11 studies, 16-20 weeks in one study, 24 weeks in three studies, 6 months in three studies, 40 weeks in one study and 1 year in one study.
Olanzapine, oxazepam, lorazepam and mianserin had twice the average cognitive toxicity of other treatments. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) impaired cognition to a lesser extent than other pharmacological groupings. There was extensive intra-class variation: fluvoxamine (PIR = 0.08) possessed little detrimental cognitive activity, whereas sertraline (PIR = 5.33) caused impairment over five times the SSRI group average. Benzodiazepines caused noticeable cognitive impairment.
Methadone is used in opioid rotation and administered to patients with cancer pain not responsive to morphine or other strong opioids when intractable opioid adverse effects appear. Methadone is considered as the first strong opioid analgesic and in patients with renal impairment. Methadone possesses different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in comparison to other opioids. The advantages of methadone include multimode analgesic activity, high oral and rectal bioavailability, long lasting analgesia, lack of active metabolites, excretion mainly with faeces, low cost and a weak immunosuppressive effect. The disadvantages include long and changeable plasma half-life, high bound to serum proteins, metabolism through P450 system, numerous drug interactions, lack of clear equianalgesic dose ratio to other opioids, QT interval prolongation, local reactions when administered subcutaneously.
Patients with an ARS &gt;or= 3 had a lower eGFR (p = 0.012) and were receiving more non-anticholinergic drugs (p &lt; 0.001) than patients with an ARS &lt; 3. In addition to being prescribed more anticholinergic drugs, patients with ARS &gt;or= 3 were prescribed high doses of these drugs more often than patients with ARS &lt; 3 (41.3% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.034). A higher number of non-anticholinergic drugs (p &lt; 0.001), a lower serum albumin concentration (p = 0.014), and a lower eGFR (p = 0.012) were independently associated with a higher ARS.
Of 84 patients of AOSD, 59 (70.2%) were female, 25 (29.8%) were male. Arthralgia (96.4%), fever (95.2%), arthritis (69%), sore throat (65.5%) and typical rheumatoid rash (59.5%) were the most common findings. The mean value of laboratory findings were as follows; C-reactive protein level of 11.59 +/- 6.81 mg/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 89.05 +/- 31 mm/h, leukocyte count of 16,234.51 +/- 7785.2/microl. Leucocytosis was present in 69 patients (84.15%). Forty-eight patients had a WBC count &gt;or= 15,000/microl. Hypoalbuminaemia was present in 35 patients. Abnormal levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were observed in 30 patients, whereas abnormal levels of alkaline phosphatase in 16 patients. Thirty-seven patients had an ESR value of more than 100 mm/h. Thirty-two patients had a ferritin value of more than 1000 ng/dl.
Twenty-one patients (8%) had parents who were consanguineous, which was not more frequent compared with the general population (14%). The mean age of disease onset and the mean age at which RA was diagnosed were lower in patients with parental consanguinity, although the difference was not statistically significant. The other clinical and laboratory parameters were also not different between the two groups.
The inflammatory reaction reached a peak at 12 h for both the dermis and subcutaneous region, being graded as moderate and moderate to severe, respectively. There was an influx of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. A significant increase in the number of mast cells, as well as the presence of hyperemic vessels and apoptotic bodies, was observed. There was TUNEL staining in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, muscles, and in the cells of the inflammatory infiltrate. There was a significant decrease in the area occupied by collagen after 12 h.
There was an estimated average of 4,124,038 +/- 202,977 annual visits for dermatophytoses during the study period. Tinea unguium, tinea corporis, tinea pedis, tinea capitis, and tinea cruris represented 23.2%, 20.4%, 18.8%, 15.0%, and 8.4%, respectively, of such infections; 71.6% of tinea unguium visits occurred among those older than 45 years. Tinea capitis was significantly more common among the black than the white population (prevalence odds ratio = 12.4; 95% confidence interval, 9.9-15.7). Ineffective treatment of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris with polyenes, such as nystatin, commonly occurred.
Bcl-2 is useful for the detection of BCC with diffuse expression in nests of basaloid cells, but cannot distinguish between BCC with follicular differentiation and trichoblastoma, as both lesions show the same pattern with positive and negative areas. Conversely, CD10 expression can distinguish between trichoblastomas with peritumoral stromal staining and BCCs with epithelial staining. If both stromal and epithelial areas are stained, these cases are classified as BCC with follicular differentiation.
Six hundred and seventy-two cases of primary melanoma were recorded, with an incidence rate of 14.1 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. Differences related to gender (41.1% males and 58.9% females) and age (35% in the 50-70-year age group) were found. The trunk (30.7%) and lower limbs (25.94%) were the most frequent sites observed. The superficial spreading histiotype and thin melanoma (&lt; or = 1.00 mm) were more often recorded (44.8% and 62%, respectively).
All patients had a diagnosis of ID according to previously established criteria, despite being adults. HTLV-1 infection was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting assays, and polymerase chain reaction. The male to female ratio was 1 : 3 and the median age at diagnosis was 42 years. The cutaneous manifestations were erythematous, scaly, and crusted lesions in all patients, and ichthyosis in three of the four cases. Histopathologic study showed lymphocytic epidermotropism in two cases. The median proviral load was 281 copies/10,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Immunodeficiency was not observed in any case. The therapies used were antimicrobials, corticosteroids, and phototherapy.
Thirty-seven per cent of patients were cured within 15 days. The cure percentage reached 81% when 20 mg/kg/day was continued to 20 days. Twenty-five patients who failed to respond were subjected to a further course of glucantime injection. Sixteen responded by the 10th day of treatment, and the remaining nine were cured by completion of the second course, i.e. within 40 days. The drug was administered intramuscularly. The common side-effects noted were vertigo, headache, anorexia, temperature, and joint pain.
The patient was treated with aggressive hydration, allopurinol, and repeated hemodialysis. He gradually improved and his biochemical markers returned to normal.
The prevalence of MS, JMS, and diabetes was 6.4%, 5.5%, and 4.3%,13.2%, 11.5%, and 5.5%, 15.1%, 13.8%, and 5.1%, and 24.3%, 21.3%, and 8.5%, respectively through the quartiles of WBC in men (p&lt;0.0001, &lt;0.0001, and &lt;0.01, respectively in comparison between the lowest quartile of WBC and the highest quartile of WBC) and 2.2%, 0.4%, and 0.4%, 4.5%, 0.7%, and 1.1%, 9.3%, 1.9%, and 1.5%, and 12.3%, 4.8%, and 3.3%, respectively through the quartiles of WBC in women (p&lt;0.0001, &lt;0.01, and &lt;0.05, respectively in comparison between the lowest quartile of WBC and the highest quartile of WBC).
Neuroimaging findings were characterized by a T1-hyperintense unilateral lesion restricted to the striatum, contralateral to the symptomatic limbs. The biopsied striatum contained patchy necrotic tissue, severe thickening of all layers of arterioles, and marked narrowing of vessel lumens. Hyaline degeneration of the arteriolar walls, extravasation of erythrocytes, and prominent capillary proliferation were also notable, together with lymphocytic infiltration and macrophage invasion. In one patient, PET examination revealed decreased accumulation of FDG in the lesion. The MR spectrum for the diseased striatum revealed a decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio (1.35), normal Cho/Cr ratio (1.22), and a peak for myoinositol, while the spectrum on the contralateral site revealed a decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio (1.48), increase in Cho/Cr (1.32), but no peak for myoinositol.
PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo-enhanced CT scans showed progressive reductions in K(PS) from day 1 to 2 to 9 (from 2.55 to 1.27 to 0.69 microL min(-1) cm(-3), respectively, P &lt; 0.005 for each comparison of day 1-2 and day 2-9). No significant difference was seen in the K(PS) estimates derived from iohexol-enhanced CT scans obtained before or after treatment (276 vs. 223.8 microL min(-1) cm(-3), respectively, P = 0.54). The microvascular leak (K(PS)) was significantly larger for iohexol than for PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo-enhanced CT, P &lt; 0.05.
FA was significantly lower in areas II to IV of the CC in children as compared with adults (P &lt; 0.05). In area III, where callosal motor fibers cross the CC, FA differed significantly between children and adolescents (P &lt; 0.05). TMS parameters demonstrated significant age-related differences in duration and extent of iSP (P &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were detected regarding latency of iSP.
T1- and T2-weighted images before administration of treosulfan showed viable tumor tissue with small necrotic areas. At 24 hours after treosulfan injection, a significantly higher increase in ADC in the viable parts of the tumor could be observed in tumors of mice that had been injected with the higher dose of treosulfan compared with mice injected with the lower dose treosulfan, whereas no significant volumetric differences between the 2 different doses could be observed. Seventy-two hours after injection of treosulfan the ADC values in the viable parts of the tumor of mice treated with the high dose of treosulfan further increased and the tumor volume in the high-dose group was now significantly lower than in the low-dose group.
Global EF analysis showed a high correlation (r2 = 0.85; y = 0.94x + 4.85, P &lt; 0.001) between the Argus and CIM analyses. Sixteen-segment regional EF analysis showed p(a) averages &gt;0.60. Regional wall motion by short axis slices showed pa averages &gt;0.75, and combined analyses of all 3 reviewers' 16-segment regional data showed an overall total p(a) = 0.79 (sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 88%). Interobserver and intraobserver variability were low (p(a) &gt; 0.65) in this study.
DEBR showed better image quality than SBBR (P &lt; 0.05; median image quality DEBR: 1; SBBR - MC: 3; SBBR + MC: 2). Less vessel segmentation errors occurred in DEBR (P &lt; 0.05; median DEBR: 0; SBBR - MC: 5; SBBR + MC: 1). The number of nonremoved bones was not significantly different between DEBR and SBBR + MC, but significantly higher in SBBR - MC (median DEBR: 1; SBBR - MC: 2; SBBR + MC: 0). Time for generation of MIPs was lowest for SBBR - MC (P &lt; 0.05), but also DEBR was significantly faster than manually corrected SBBR (DEBR: 160 +/- 16 seconds; SBBR - MC: 95 +/- 12 seconds; SBBR + MC: 373 +/- 69 seconds). The plaque removal tool lead to an improvement of image quality of the MIPs and a better depiction of the residual lumen in 43%.
There was a clear protective effect of tea consumption in the pooled risk estimate [OR: 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.92)] with 2215 cases and 145578 controls. However, the homogeneity test was significant (p value of 0.008), denoting heterogeneity across the pooled studies. Pooled analysis applying the random effect model was OR: 0.81 with 95% confidence interval nearly overlapping unity (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.98). Tea consumers versus non-consumers in Chinese populations had pooled OR of 0.73 with 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.90 (470 cases and 623 controls). The p value of homogeneity test was 0.96, denoting homogeneity across the pooled 3 studies.
AA and DHA intakes were 57 +/- 35 mg/day and 37 +/- 63 mg/day, ranged between 1.2-180 mg/day and 0-350 mg/day and varied day to day at 0-380 mg/day and 0-991 mg/d, respectively. DHA intake was &lt;or=30 mg/day for 74% of the subjects.
FRAP and plasma thiol (SH) groups increased, while plasma MDA levels decreased in subjects receiving the cinnamon extract. Effects were larger after 12 than 6 weeks. There was also a positive correlation (r = 0.74; p = 0.014) between MDA and plasma glucose.
Mean age was 51.7 y for men and 47.0 y for women. Mean body mass index (BMI) values were 24.9 for men and 22.6 for women. Obesity rate was 4% and cardiovascular risk factors were low. Mean percent energy from fat was 37% (saturated fat 16%) and very few respondents met US dietary guidelines for fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Higher diet quality, as indexed by HEI scores, was associated with being older, married, better educated, physically active, and having never smoked. For men only, higher HEI scores were weakly associated with lower BMI and lower blood pressure. HEI was not associated with plasma lipid measures.
GI of MWF (83 +/- 7) was 12% lower than that of SWF (94 +/- 9) at 90 min but the effect was not significant. Insulinaemic index of MWF was significantly lower than that of SWF at 90 min (78 +/- 6 vs 98 +/- 8). Hunger feelings were lower following MWF consumption and were positively correlated (r = 0.98; P &lt; 0.05) with plasma ghrelin concentrations, for which there was no significant difference between SWF and MWF. Starch granules of SWF were fully gelatinised unlike those of MWF.
In this cohort (n = 207), the prevalence of iron deficiency was similar (p &gt; 0.05) between normal and overweight (BMI 25.0-30.0 kg/m(2)), and normal and overfat (BF &gt;or=30.0%) volunteers. There were no differences in individual iron status indicators, including sTfR, between overweight or overfat volunteers as compared to normal weight and normal fat peers. Logistic regression analyses indicated that overfat volunteers had a lower (p &lt; 0.05) risk of iron deficiency, whereas overweight individuals demonstrated no change in relative risk as compared to peers.
The addition of CLA to the diet led to significantly greater liver weight due to hyperplasia. No changes were observed in liver composition. CLA did not modify the expression or the activity of analysed oxidative enzymes. With regard to lipogenic enzymes, an increase in the expression and the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was found.
Women with anembryonic pregnancies had statistically significantly lower levels of folate and 10 elements including V, Ti, Li, Cd, Sr, Rb, P, Na, K, and B than did women experiencing normal pregnancies. However, they had higher homocysteine and Ge levels than did the controls.
The mean energy and nutrient intakes remained constant during study period. No significant differences were found in the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CRP between treatments. The scores of disease severity measurements were not significantly different between treatments, although quercetin supplementation had a tendency to reduce VAS.
Total energy intake was lower during intervention week than non-intervention week (P &lt; .01), including macronutrient contents (all P's &lt; .01), meal size (P &lt; .01), consumption of sugar (P &lt; .01), sugared sodas (P &lt; .01) and sodium (P &lt; .01). Steps/day were higher during intervention week than non-intervention week (P &lt; .01).
The most recent NHANES data demonstrated that a significant proportion of the American population did not meet recommendations for calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Less than 3% of the population consumed the recommended level or more of potassium. Only 30% of the US population 2 years of age and older obtained the recommended level of calcium or more and 55% consumed less than the EAR for magnesium. Recommending 3-4 servings from the dairy group for all people greater than 9 years of age may be necessary in order to ensure adequate intake of calcium and magnesium, assuming the current diet remains the same. More than 4 servings of dairy would be needed to meet the potassium recommendation at all ages.
After evaluating 969 potentially eligible published studies, the reviewers found that the authors of 41 studies had evaluated the effect of infant formula on enamel fluorosis risk. Authors of 14 of the 41 studies did not report their findings in their results. The authors of the remaining 27 published studies reported the findings of 19 observational studies; authors of 17 of these 19 studies reported ORs and, among these, infant formula consumption was associated with a higher prevalence of enamel fluorosis in the permanent dentition (summary OR 1.8, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.3). There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2) 66 percent) and evidence of publication bias (P = .002). A metaregression analysis indicated that the ORs associating infant formula with enamel fluorosis increased by 5 percent for each 0.1-part-per-million increase in the reported levels of fluoride in the water supply (OR 1.05, 95 percent CI 1.02-1.09).
Permanent maxillary right first molars with fluorosis consistently had lower levels of caries experience than did normal molars. Adjusted odds ratios for caries prevalence in molars with fluorosis were 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.89) in communities with nonfluoridated or suboptimally fluoridated water and 0.89 (95 percent CI, 0.74-1.06) in communities with water at or above optimal fluoridation levels.
After reviewing conditions that may lead to necrosis of the jawbones, the authors divided the causes of ONJ into the following conditions: systemic medication use; radiation; bacterial, viral and deep fungal infections; direct chemical toxicity; trauma; idiopathy; and other etiologies.
At 18 months, the retention rate for the IB group was statistically lower than those for the CS, IBB and CSB groups. Marginal discoloration occurred in all groups and was statistically worse in the IB group.
Among the Medicaid-enrolled children in 2002, 42 percent had had one or more dental visits during the year. At least 20 percent of the children with a dental visit in 2002 were treated by providers who billed Medicaid exclusively for diagnostic and preventive (DP) services. Children treated by DP care providers were less likely to receive restorative and/or surgical services than were children who were treated by dentists who provided a comprehensive mix of dental services. The logistic model showed that children who visited a DP-care provider were about 2.5 times less likely to receive restorative or surgical treatments than were children who visited comprehensive-care providers. Older children and African-American children were less likely to receive restorative and surgical treatments from both types of providers.
Eighty-five participants had MC1R gene variants (65 of the 67 red-haired participants and 20 of the 77 dark-haired participants) (P &lt; .001). Participants with MC1R gene variants reported significantly more dental care-related anxiety and fear of dental pain than did participants with no MC1R gene variants. They were more than twice as likely to avoid dental care as were the participants with no MC1R gene variants, even after the authors controlled for general trait anxiety and sex.
The study results show that lesion depths generally were greater after exposure of enamel to sour candies than they were after exposure of enamel to original-flavor candies, as well as for candies dissolved in water compared with those dissolved in artificial saliva. Lesion depths were negatively associated with the initial slurry pH and positively associated with titratable acidity.
Significant treatment-by-time interactions (P&lt;.05) were found for the Tinetti Mobility Score and its gait and balance subscores and for walking, bathing, and stair climbing.
In the youngest participants (&lt;65), SBP and DBP were not associated with cognitive function 11 years later. For persons aged 65 to 74, higher baseline SBP and DBP were related to worse cognitive function 11 years later. In contrast, in older age (&gt; or = 75), higher SBP and DBP seemed to be related to better cognitive function at the end of follow-up. This effect appeared strongest in the highest age group (aged 85).
During the first 16 hours corresponding to the usual waking day, both groups rated themselves as alert and had similar levels of vigilance and little evidence of sleepiness. As the wake episode continued, the older subjects were less impaired, showing faster reaction times, fewer performance lapses and attentional failures, and less frequent unintentional sleep episodes than the younger subjects.
A large proportion (46.7%) of 3,251 Medicaid beneficiaries living in nursing homes and taking cholinesterase inhibitors received anticholinergics concomitantly. Anticholinergics designated as Level 3, or having markedly anticholinergic adverse effects, accounted for most of the concomitant anticholinergic use. More than half (58.1%) of the individuals with concomitant anticholinergic use had 100 or more days of such use.
Although no between-group differences were noted for usual gait speed, rapid gait speed improved significantly more for the PAC group (1.56 +/- 0.41 m/s to 1.68 +/- 0.44 m/s) than with UC (1.57 +/- 0.40 m/sec to 1.59 +/- 0.42 m/sec, P=.04). Minutes of moderate/vigorous PA increased significantly in the PAC group (from 57.1 +/- 99.3 to 126.6 +/- 142.9 min/wk) but not in the UC group (from 60.2 +/- 116.1 to 69.6 +/- 116.1 min/wk, P&lt;.001). Changes in other functional/disability outcomes were small.
Agreement between self-report and chart data was high for diabetes mellitus (kappa=0.94) intermediate for asthma (kappa=0.66), and hypertension (kappa=0.54) and low for depression (kappa=0.4). Sensitivity and specificity were high for diabetes mellitus (0.99 and 0.96, respectively) and low for depression (0.74 and 0.72, respectively). Specificity for hypertension was lowest (0.67). Age, education, health literacy, and other patient characteristics did not have clear associations across conditions.
The review included 10 qualitative and 21 quantitative studies; 293 findings, 46 categories, and 11 themes emerged. The 11 HRQL themes were physical impact, social impact, psychological effect, PU symptoms, general health, and other impacts of PUs: healthcare professional-client relationships, need for versus effect of interventions, impact on others, financial impact, perceived etiology, and need for knowledge.
A small proportion of the sample (1.4%) reported nonprescription use of prescription pain relievers during the previous year. Combinations of acetaminophen and hydrocodone or propoxyphene were the most commonly used drugs. Use was associated with younger age (odds ratio (OR)=2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.31-4.36), American Indian and Alaska native (OR=8.78, 95% CI=2.50-30.85), and use of marijuana (OR=7.07, 95% CI=3.99-12.53). Fewer than 10% of nonprescription users were abusing these medications or dependent upon them.
Of 323 HCPs, 123 (38.1%) recalled making at least one medical decision; 232 decisions were made, concerning feeding problems (27.2%), infections (20.7%), pain (12.9%), dyspnea (8.2%), behavior problems (6.9%), hospitalizations (3.9%), cancer (3.0%), and other complications (17.2%). Mean DSI score +/- standard deviation was 78.4 +/- 19.5, indicating high overall satisfaction. NH provider involvement in shared decision-making was the area of least satisfaction. In adjusted analysis, greater decision-making satisfaction was associated with the resident living on a special care dementia unit (P=.002), greater resident comfort (P=.004), and the HCP not being the resident's child (P=.02).
Almost three-quarters (74.2%) of the cohort combined use of at least one prescription drug and one dietary supplement, with 32.5% using three or more prescription drugs and three or more supplements. The 15 most-prevalent prescription drugs exhibited substantial concomitant use with dietary supplements, ranging from 77.6% for diuretics to 93.6% for estrogen preparations. Although supplements were taken concomitantly with all classes of prescription drugs, the use of supplements was more likely in individuals using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, thyroid drugs, and estrogens. The use of drugs for diabetes mellitus was negatively associated with the use of supplements, with most of this attributed to low use in those taking multivitamins, glucosamine and chondroitin, and echinacea.
Seventy-two percent (n=48) of older adults who had been physically abused within 30 days before examination had bruises. The physically abused older adults had significantly larger bruises; more of them knew the cause of their bruises (43 (89.6%) vs 16 (23.5%) of the comparison group); and they were significantly more likely to have bruises on the face, lateral aspect of the right arm and the posterior torso (including back, chest, lumbar, and gluteal regions) than older adults from an earlier study who had not been abused (n=68).
The analyses showed that severe periodontal inflammation in at least three teeth at age 70 was marginally related to mortality during 21-year follow-up (crude hazard ratio (HR)=1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.91-1.78). The estimate increased slightly when adjusted for sex, income, fatigue, and smoking (adjusted HR=1.37, 95% CI=0.97-1.92). The estimates were attenuated when adjusted for the specific diseases, especially arteriostenosis and osteoarthritis.
Nine hundred thirty-five patients were included in the derivation cohort and 2,015 in the validation cohort. Mortality was 6% in the derivation cohort and 7% in the validation cohort. In the derivation cohort, logistic regression revealed five independent mortality predictors: respiratory compromise (respiratory rate &gt;20 breaths per minute or hypoxemia) (odds ratio (OR)=4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.7-9.4), tachycardia (heart rate &gt; or = 120 betas per minute; OR=3.2, 95% CI=1.6-6.3), cardiovascular failure (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg despite fluid challenge or lactate &gt; or = 4.0; OR=9.0, 95% CI=4.7-17), preexisting terminal illness (OR=5.7, 95% CI=2.2-15), and platelet count less than 150,000/mm3 (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.3-5.6). Mortality increased with the number of factors: 0.51% for no factors, 3.1% for one factor, 14% for two factors, 47% for three or more risk factors. The c-statistic was 0.87 for the derivation model and 0.74 for the validation model. Almost 80% of patients in both cohorts were in low-risk groups (0 or 1 factor).
Higher IGFBP-1 and higher IGFBP-2 were significantly associated with lower fasting insulin, lower fasting glucose, and lower adiposity, but higher IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 were associated with greater mortality. In multivariate adjusted models, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.48 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14-1.92) per standard deviation (SD) increase in IGFBP-2 and 1.34 (95% CI=1.01-1.76) per SD increase in IGFBP-1. No association was found between IGF-1 and all-cause mortality.
Daily manual oral brushing plus 0.12% chlorhexidine rinse demonstrated high feasibility, high staff adherence, and effectiveness in improving oral hygiene (P&lt;.001 vs baseline); this combination administered twice per day showed the highest plaque score reduction. Daily manual oral brushing and upright feeding positioning demonstrated high feasibility, high staff adherence, and effectiveness in improving swallowing.
Logistic and linear regression analyses showed no treatment effect on restraint status, restraint intensity, or multiple restraint use in any of the three postintervention measurements. Furthermore, only small changes occurred in the types of restraints used with residents in the experimental group.
Eighty-eight participants received arthroscopic decompression (forty-three in the placebo arm and forty-five in the ropivacaine arm) and seventy received rotator cuff repair (thirty-five participants in each treatment arm). Compared with placebo, ropivacaine infusion resulted in a significant but clinically unimportant improvement in average pain in the first twelve hours following both procedures (the average pain score was 1.62 and 2.16 for the ropivacaine and placebo arms, respectively, in the arthroscopic decompression group and 2.12 and 2.82 in the rotator cuff repair group, with a pooled difference between groups of 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 1.01; p = 0.003). When adjusted for opioid use, the pooled difference between groups was 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.86; p = 0.009). No difference was detected between groups with regard to the maximum pain in the first twelve hours or the average or maximum pain in the second twelve hours, with or without adjustment for opioid use, and no difference was found between groups with regard to the amount of oral analgesia used. No difference was detected between groups with regard to the prevalence of nausea and vomiting, catheter leakage, delayed discharge, or stiff painful shoulder, and no participant in either group had a postoperative infection develop.
At six weeks, the mean DASH score for the patients with a volar plate was significantly better than that for the patients treated with external fixation (p = 0.037) but similar to that for the patients with a radial column plate (p = 0.33). At three months, the patients with a volar plate demonstrated a DASH score that was significantly better than that for both the patients treated with external fixation (p = 0.028) and those with a radial column plate (p = 0.027). By six months and one year, all three groups had DASH scores comparable with those for the normal population. At one year, grip strength was similar among the three groups. The lateral pinch strength of the patients with a volar plate was significantly better than that of the patients with a radial column plate at three months (p = 0.042) and one year (p = 0.036), but no other significant differences in lateral pinch strength were found among the three groups at the other follow-up periods. The range of motion of the wrist did not differ significantly among the groups at any time beginning twelve weeks after the surgery. At one year, the patients with a radial column plate had maintained radial inclination and radial length that were significantly better than these measurements in both the patients treated with external fixation and those with a volar plate (all p &lt; 0.05).
Follow-up was complete for twenty-eight subjects in the Trabecular Metal group and twenty-one subjects in the cemented group. A subset of the Trabecular Metal components migrated extensively in the postoperative period, but all stabilized by one year and the proportion considered to be at risk for early aseptic loosening was 0.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 0.12) in the group as a whole. Four cemented components were considered to be at risk for early aseptic loosening (proportion at risk, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.4).
Two hundred and ninety-three patients returned for the ten-year follow-up evaluation. A total of twenty-eight knees had been revised. Ten-year survivorship, with revision for any reason (or the time at which patients were documented as requiring revision but were unfit for surgery) as the end point, was 94.5% (95% confidence interval, 90.4% to 96.8%) for the all-polyethylene design and 96% (95% confidence interval, 92.6% to 97.8%) for the metal-backed design. Ten-year survivorship, with aseptic failure as the end point, was 97% (95% confidence interval, 93.3% to 98.7%) for the all-polyethylene design and 96.8% (95% confidence interval, 93.6% to 98.4%) for the metal-backed design. On the basis of the numbers available at ten years, there was no significant difference in survivorship between the two designs (p &gt; 0.05).
At an average of 2.7 years, the median ASES and L'Insalata scores were 97 and 93, respectively, compared with baseline scores of 62 and 65 (p &lt; 0.05). The median patient-reported satisfaction rating was 9 (of 10); forty-one patients (87%) rated the outcome as good or excellent. The median patient-reported satisfaction rating was significantly higher for patients with a discrete traumatic etiology than for those with an atraumatic etiology (9 compared with 7); however, there was no significant difference between these groups in terms of the ASES or L'Insalata outcome scores. Overall, twenty-five (74%) of the thirty-four athletes were able to return to their preinjury level of competition, whereas eleven (92%) of the twelve athletes who reported a discrete traumatic event were able to return to their previous level of competition. There were five complications, including four cases of refractory postoperative stiffness.
Eighty-eight percent (twenty-two) of the twenty-five patients in the investigational group and 86% (eighteen) of the twenty-one patients in the control group were considered to have completed the twenty-four-month follow-up. At all follow-up intervals, there were significant improvements in the clinical outcome measures, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, Short Form-36 scores, and back and leg pain scores, in both groups. At twenty-four months, the improvement in the mean ODI score, as compared with the preoperative score, was 28.2 points in the investigational group and 23.0 points in the control group. By twenty-four months, 95% (eighteen) of nineteen patients in the investigational group compared with 70% (fourteen) of twenty in the control group had a radiographically documented fusion. The overall success rate was 81% (seventeen of twenty-one) in the investigational group and 55% (eleven of twenty) in the control group (p = 0.345).
The most commonly reported bearing was metal-on-polyethylene (51%) followed by metal-on-metal (35%) and ceramic-on-ceramic (14%). Metal-on-polyethylene bearings were most commonly reported in female Medicare patients who were sixty-five to seventy-four years old, while metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic bearings were most commonly reported in privately insured male patients who were less than sixty-five years old. Thirty-three percent of patients over sixty-five years old had a hard-on-hard bearing reported. There was substantial regional variation in bearing usage; the highest prevalence of metal-on-polyethylene bearings was reported in the Northeast and at nonteaching hospitals, and the highest prevalence of metal-on-metal bearings was reported in the South and at teaching hospitals.
Compared with patients with controlled diabetes mellitus, patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus had a significantly increased odds of stroke (adjusted odds ratio = 3.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.87 to 6.25; p &lt; 0.001), urinary tract infection (adjusted odds ratio = 1.97; 95% confidence interval = 1.61 to 2.42; p &lt; 0.001), ileus (adjusted odds ratio = 2.47; 95% confidence interval = 1.67 to 3.64; p &lt; 0.001), postoperative hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio = 1.99; 95% confidence interval = 1.38 to 2.87; p &lt; 0.001), transfusion (adjusted odds ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 1.36; p = 0.011), wound infection (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28; 95% confidence interval = 1.36 to 3.81; p = 0.002), and death (adjusted odds ratio = 3.23; 95% confidence interval = 1.87 to 5.57; p &lt; 0.001). Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus had a significantly increased length of stay (almost a full day) as compared with patients with controlled diabetes (p &lt; 0.0001). All patients with diabetes had significantly increased inflation-adjusted postoperative charges when compared with nondiabetic patients (p &lt; 0.0001).
Twenty patients were assessed at an average of thirty-three months after the injury. Seventeen patients had returned to riding horses, and ten felt that they had returned to their previous level of recreation, which had been "heavy" in nine cases and "moderate" in one. Eighteen patients had returned to their previous employment. Eighteen patients were found to have sexual dysfunction at the time of the latest follow-up. The mean Iowa pelvic score was 84 points (range, 56 to 99 points). The Short Form-36 outcomes scores were diminished in two subsections, role physical and role emotional, compared with population norms.
Fifty feet (83%) in the control group were classified as grade IV or less and ten, as grade V. All feet in the hallux valgus group were classified as grade V or greater preoperatively, forty-eight feet (74%) were classified as grade IV or less at the early follow-up evaluation, and forty-two feet (65%) were classified as grade IV or less at the most recent follow-up evaluation. The average hallux valgus angle in the hallux valgus group was 38.3 degrees (range, 25 degrees to 60 degrees ) preoperatively, 11.9 degrees (range, 4 degrees to 28 degrees ) at the time of the early follow-up, and 13.9 degrees (range, 0 degrees to 33 degrees ) at the time of the most recent follow-up. There was no significant difference in the average hallux valgus angle between the early and most recent follow-up evaluations in the feet that were considered to be in the normal-position group at the time of the early follow-up (p = 0.084). In the feet that were considered to be in the displacement group at the time of the early follow-up, the average hallux valgus angle at the time of the most recent follow-up was significantly greater than that at the time of the early follow-up (19.5 degrees +/- 8.4 degrees compared with 15.0 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees ) (p = 0.0082). The feet that were in the displacement group at the time of the early follow-up had a greater risk of having recurrence of the hallux valgus at that time than did those in the normal-position group (odds ratio, 10.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.75 to 36.33).
Nine patients had no extensor lag, and three patients had 5 degrees to 15 degrees of extensor lag. The mean amount of knee flexion was 103 degrees (range, 60 degrees to 120 degrees ). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 24.3 (81%) of a maximum of 30. Complete bone union occurred in nine patients, and partial union occurred in three patients. At the time of writing, no secondary bone-grafting procedures had been required to achieve union, and no revision or removal of the reconstruction had been performed. Rotational or free flaps provided satisfactory wound coverage in all patients. A deep infection occurred in one patient whose allograft and prosthesis were successfully retained after treatment with surgical débridement and intravenous antibiotics.
There were 1736 consecutive VEPTR procedures at six centers: 327 (in 299 patients) consisted of a primary device implantation, 224 were a device exchange, and 1185 were a device lengthening. Perioperative clinical neurologic injury was noted in eight (0.5%) of the 1736 cases: these injuries were identified after five (1.5%) of the 327 procedures for primary device implantation, three (1.3%) of the 224 device exchanges, and none of the 1185 device-lengthening procedures. Of the eight cases of neurologic injury, six involved the upper extremity and two involved the lower extremity. The neurologic deficit was temporary in seven patients and permanent in one patient, who had persistent neurogenic arm and hand pain. Intraoperative neuromonitoring demonstrated changes during six (0.3%) of the 1736 procedures: five (1.5%) of the 327 procedures for primary device implantation and one (0.08%) of the 1185 device-lengthening procedures. The surgery was altered in all six cases, with resolution of the monitoring changes in five cases and persistent signal changes and a neurologic deficit (upper-extremity brachial plexopathy) in one. Two patients had false-negative results of monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, and one had false-negative results of monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials during implant surgery; two had a brachial plexopathy and one had monoplegia postoperatively, with all three recovering.
The polyethylene wear rate was 0.101 mm/yr for the cable group and 0.082 mm/yr for the wire group (p = 0.039). For the living patients, the rate of revision of the acetabular component because of aseptic loosening was 37.3% (twenty-two hips) for the cable group and 20.7% (nineteen hips) for the wire group (p = 0.025). The rate of acetabular osteolysis was 44% (twenty-six hips) for the cable group and 26% (twenty-four hips) for the wire group (p = 0.022). Kaplan-Meier analysis with revision of the acetabular component because of aseptic loosening as the end point demonstrated survival rates of 73.7% +/- 9% and 83% +/- 7% for the cable and wire groups, respectively, at twenty years (p = 0.03).
The mean tibiofibular distraction difference was 19.1 +/- 10.6 mm (range, 2 to 51 mm), the mean proximal tibiofibular joint distraction was 10.1 +/- 6.8 mm (range, 0 to 33 mm), and the mean tibial valgus angulation was 8.7 degrees +/- 4.4 degrees . At the time of the latest follow-up, twenty-eight segments (25%) had lateral knee joint laxity at 30 degrees of knee flexion and eight segments (7%) had fibular head subluxation at 90 degrees of knee flexion. Twenty-four (86%) of the twenty-eight cases of knee laxity were observed in skeletally immature patients. The tibiofibular distraction difference, proximal tibiofibular joint distraction, and tibial valgus angulation were significantly greater in the group without fixation of the proximal tibiofibular joint. A significant decrease in the tibial valgus angulation and knee laxity was found in patients with lengthening over an intramedullary nail. In the intramedullary nail group, after fixation of the proximal tibiofibular joint, the tibiofibular distraction difference and the proximal tibiofibular joint distraction decreased; however, the proportion of cases with clinically important tibial valgus angulation (&gt;10 degrees ) increased significantly.
The mean postoperative WOMAC score (and standard deviation) for the 112 patients who had been followed for a minimum of two years was 5.5% +/- 0.1%, and the mean postoperative Lysholm score was 89 +/- 17 points. The number of grafts, the size of the transplanted cylinders, and patient age did not influence either the Lysholm or the WOMAC score. A higher body mass index and lower general satisfaction ratings did negatively influence the Lysholm and WOMAC scores. Gradual clinical improvement, as measured with the Lysholm score for all 200 study subjects, continued throughout the postoperative period.
The mean Constant score (and standard deviation) at the time of final follow-up was significantly better in the locked-plate group (68.6 +/- 9.5 points) than in the hemiarthroplasty group (60.6 +/- 5.9 points) (p &lt; 0.001). The Constant scores for the three-part fractures in the locked-plate and hemiarthroplasty groups were 71.6 and 60.4 points (p &lt; 0.001), respectively, and the scores for the four-part fractures in those groups were 64.7 and 60.1 points (p = 0.19), respectively. Patients with an initial varus extension deformity in the locked-plate group had significantly worse outcomes than those with a valgus impacted pattern (Constant score, 63.8 compared with 74.6 points, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Complications in the group treated with locked-plate fixation included osteonecrosis in six patients, screw perforation of the humeral head in six patients, loss of fixation in four patients, and wound infection in three patients. Loss of fixation was seen only in patients with &gt;20 degrees of initial varus angulation of the humeral head. Complications in the hemiarthroplasty group included nonunion of the tuberosity in seven patients and wound infection in three patients.
We observed a significantly smaller mean cross-sectional area at all levels of the spinal cord in the study group as compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01). When the pathological segments were evaluated, both with and without the inclusion of the adjacent normal segments, the spinal cord was smaller for the study group (p &lt; 0.01). Within the study group, small spinal cords were observed in patients with failed vertebral formation as well as in patients with failed vertebral segmentation, but without an identifiable difference between these two subgroups. The spinal canal was also smaller for the patients in the study group, but not in all cases. No patient showed a reduction of, or encroachment on, the space available for the spinal cord. Spinal cord size increased with age in both the study group and the control group but remained consistently smaller in the study group. Within the study group, the presence of intraspinal anomalies did not appear to influence the spinal cord size.
The expected value of a favorable hip outcome was 0.9590 for the strategy of screening all neonates with physical examination and selective use of ultrasonography, 0.9586 for screening all neonates with physical examination and ultrasonography, and 0.9578 for no screening. A lower expected value implies a greater risk for the development of osteoarthritis as a result of developmental dysplasia of the hip or avascular necrosis; thus, the optimum strategy was selective screening. This model was robust to sensitivity analysis, except when the rate of missed dysplasia rose as high as 4/1000 or the rate of treated hip subluxation/dislocation was the same; then, the optimum strategy was to screen all neonates with both physical examination and ultrasonography.
Half of the participants had no consistent asymmetrical deficit on the fractured side. Regression analyses showed that asymmetrical measures of lower-limb pain, muscle mass, and disease and injury burden predicted asymmetrical deficit in knee extension torque (R(2) = 0.43) and in the rate of force development (R(2) = 0.36). More intense pain and disease and injury burden affecting the nonfractured limb and smaller muscle mass relative to the fractured limb were associated with a smaller asymmetrical deficit.
The best cutoff points on the axonal viability index for each nerve (and its sensitivity and specificity) were &lt;10% (88% and 89%, respectively) for the axillary nerve, 0% (88% and 73%) for the musculocutaneous nerve, &lt;20% (82% and 97%) for the proximal radial nerve, &lt;50% (82% and 97%) for the distal radial nerve, and &lt;50% (59% and 97%) for the ulnar nerve. The indices from the proximal radial, distal radial, and ulnar nerves had better specificities compared with the most frequently used clinical criterion: absence of biceps function at three months of age.
We identified no difference, with regard to medial ulnohumeral joint incongruity as seen radiographically, among stages 1 through 6 during the tests with muscle loading. A significant difference in medial ulnohumeral joint incongruity was found in stages 7 (p = 0.003) and 8 (p &lt; 0.001). The clinical (visually assessed) lateral ulnohumeral joint space gap was negligible in stages 1 through 4 but increased significantly at all stages involving overlengthening (gross gap, 0.9 mm with 2 mm of overlengthening [p = 0.005], 2.3 mm with 4 mm of overlengthening [p &lt; 0.001], 3.4 mm with 6 mm [p &lt; 0.001], and 4.7 mm with 8 mm [p &lt; 0.001]).
Investment in an orthopaedic fellowship yields variable returns. Adult spine, shoulder and elbow, sports medicine, hand, and adult arthroplasty may yield positive returns. Trauma yields a neutral return, while pediatrics and foot and ankle have negative net present values. On the basis of mean reported incomes, the break-even point was two years for spine, seven years for hand, eight years for shoulder and elbow, twelve years for adult arthroplasty, thirteen years for sports medicine, and twenty-seven years for trauma. Fellowship-trained pediatric and foot and ankle surgeons did not break even following the initial investment. When working hours were controlled for, the returns for adult arthroplasty and trauma became negative.
A total of 5,074 respondents participated in the survey. From this total sample, 1,155 individuals with schizophrenia and 1,300 with bipolar disorder were self-identified. Psychiatrists were identified as the individuals primarily responsible for patients' medication prescription and surveillance of both psychological and physical health. The majority of respondents in both groups had been receiving medication for more than 5 years. Weight gain was the most commonly cited adverse event associated with medication use. Moreover, weight gain was identified as a contributing factor to general medical comorbidity (eg, diabetes mellitus) and as a detractor to quality of life. Most respondents identified weight gain and general physical health as areas of deficiency in their perceived knowledge and interactions with health care providers. Notwithstanding the ubiquity and implications of comorbid medical disorders and medication-related adverse events, most respondents did not receive opportunistic screening or surveillance for medical risk factors and disorders. Overall, respondents expressed general dissatisfaction when interacting with mental health care providers.
Mature A. fumigatus hyphae induced mast cell degranulation in the absence of IgE. Hyphae of Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus nidulans induced much less mast cell degranulation. Mast cell degranulation required direct contact with mature A. fumigatus hyphae, and was not induced by conidia or immature hyphae. Killed hyphae induced significant degranulation, whereas live hyphae from mutants deficient in the fungal development regulators StuA and MedA induced very little degranulation.
KSHV seroprevalence was 7.5%-9.0% among South African children and was not associated with age. In contrast, in the Ugandan population-based sample, KSHV seroprevalence increased from 10% among 2-year-old children to 30.6% among 8-year-old children (P(trend) &lt; .001). In the Ugandan clinic-based sample, seroprevalence increased from 9.3% among 2-year-old children to 36.4% among 8-year-old children (P(trend) &lt; .001).
Every strain contained the fhbp gene. All sequences fell into 1 of 2 subfamilies (A or B), with 60%-75% amino acid identity between subfamilies and at least 83% identity within each subfamily. One fHBP sequence may have arisen via inter-subfamily recombination. Subfamily B sequences were found in 70% of the isolates, and subfamily A sequences were found in 30%. Multiple fHBP variants were detected in each of the common MLST clonal complexes. All major MLST complexes include strains in both subfamily A and subfamily B.
There were 342 incident infections among 2655 men followed up. The incidences of infection due to N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and T. vaginalis were 3.48, 4.55, and 1.32 cases per 100 person-years, respectively. The combined incidence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infection was 7.26 cases per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 6.49-8.13 cases per 100 person-years). The incidences of these STIs, individually or combined, did not differ by circumcision status as a time-dependent variable or a fixed variable based on assignment. Risks for incident STIs in multivariate analysis included an STI at enrollment, multiple sex partners within &lt;30 days, and sexual intercourse during menses in the previous 6 months; condom use was protective.
No significant differences in clinical adverse events or laboratory toxicity were observed between vaccine and placebo recipients. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. A 4-fold increase in rotavirus immunoglobulin A titer was observed in 66.7% and 64.5% of infants after the first administration and in 62.1% and 89.7% of infants after 3 administrations of doses of 1 X 10(4) ffu and 1 X 10(5) ffu, respectively; the differences between these groups and placebo recipients were statistically significant.
Twenty-five percent of centrally located var genes were shared between children, whereas only 5% of subtelomeric genes were shared, indicating lower diversity in the former group. Linkage between group B or C var upstream sequences and DBL1alpha groups was not observed, which impeded prediction by DBL1alpha analysis. A higher proportion of var group A sequences was detected in symptomatic malaria, and a subgroup of frequently encountered var genes with complex head structure seems to be associated with severe malaria. A subset of var group C genes was frequently expressed in older children with asymptomatic high levels of parasitemia.
Addition of LE to standard growth medium increased C. albicans biofilm production and resulted in observed changes in biofilm morphology and architecture. Furthermore, LE induced germination and supported the growth of C. albicans.
Our results indicate that CD4(+) T cells from the pleural fluid and peripheral blood of patients with tuberculosis show significantly increased TLR2 expression, compared with those from healthy donors. TLR2 ligand activity was also significantly higher in the tuberculous pleural fluid than in the serum from healthy donors or patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis TLR2 ligands, 19-kDa lipoprotein, and live bacillus Calmette-Guérin all modulated cytokine production (interferon gamma and interleukin 17), cellular proliferation, survival, and migration of CD4(+) T cells isolated from pleural fluid and activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28.
Of 734 TCEs, 475 (65%) were associated with VR. The rGSSs for the 4 algorithms were the variables most strongly predictive of VR. The adjusted rGSS odds ratios ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 (P &lt; .001). Using 10-fold cross-validation, the averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for all algorithms increased from 0.76 with unweighted rGSSs to 0.80 with weighted rGSSs.
Resistance emerged in the fecal and pharyngeal flora of 25% and 33% of the subjects, respectively, mainly when local concentrations of ciprofloxacin were less than the MIC. No variable that integrated pharmacokinetic data and pharmacodynamic parameters was found to differ significantly between the subjects in whom resistance emerged and those in whom it did not. Probabilities of the emergence of resistance were not significantly different across the different antibiotic dosages.
During the surveillance period, the VE((2.5-45)) (VE over months 2.5-45 of surveillance) against a first or only episode of clinical malaria disease was 30.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.9%-40.4%; P &lt; .001), and the VE((2.5-45)) against all episodes was 25.6% (95% CI, 11.9%-37.1%; P &lt; .001). When the same period was considered, the VE((2.5-45)) for subjects protected against severe malaria was 38.3% (95% CI, 3.4%-61.3%; P = .045). At study month 45, the prevalence of P. falciparum was 34% lower in the RTS,S/AS02A group than in the control group (66 [12.2%] of 541 patients vs 101 [18.5%] of 547 patients) (P = .004).
RTS,S/AS01B and RTS,S/AS02A were well tolerated and were safe. The efficacy of RTS,S/AS01B and RTS,S/AS02A was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.9%-67.1%) and 32% (95% CI, 17.6%-47.6%), respectively. At the time of initial challenge, the RTS,S/AS01B group had greater circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific immune responses, including higher immunoglobulin (Ig) G titers, higher numbers of CSP-specific CD4(+) T cells expressing 2 activation markers (interleukin-2, interferon [IFN]-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or CD40L), and more ex vivo IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) than did the RTS,S/AS02A group. Protected vaccine recipients had a higher CSP-specific IgG titer (geometric mean titer, 188 vs 73 mug/mL; P &lt; .001), higher numbers of CSP-specific CD4(+) T cells per 10(6) CD4(+) T cells (median, 963 vs 308 CSP-specific CD4(+) T cells/10(6) CD4(+) T cells; P &lt; .001), and higher numbers of ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISPOTs (mean, 212 vs 96 spots/million cells; P &lt; .001). At rechallenge, 4 of 9 vaccine recipients in each group were still completely protected.
Early revascularization was associated with a statistically significant survival benefit both in patients &lt; 75 years of age (relative hazard 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.59; p &lt; 0.001), as well as in patients &gt; or = 75 years of age (relative hazard 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.99; p = 0.049). This benefit remained significant even after adjusting for the simultaneous effects of several putative confounders. In patients &gt; or = 75 years of age, this survival benefit was evident very early and was sustained all through the period of follow up of the cohort.
A proportional relationship was found between hematocrit and reflectance intensity in in-vitro test. Upon in-vivo detection of contrast, the sensor signal showed a 79.5 +/- 9.9% (n = 33) drop from the pre-injection baseline. This was highly reproducible and beyond the noise level of baseline, (2.5 +/- 0.9%), enabling automatic activation of the aspiration system. The signal duration was 12.2 +/- 3.7 seconds. The removal rate of contrast was 59.3 +/- 11%.
The mean patient age was 67.6 +/- 12.7 years. The LM artery was unprotected in 88.5% of cases. On follow up, the primary endpoint was met in 34% of patients. TLR occurred in 31.9% of patients, and target vessel revascularization (TVR) in 40.4%. One patient had cardiac death (2.1%) 5 months after the index procedure, possibly related to acute stent thrombosis. By univariate analysis, Type A lesions (vs. Type B; p = 0.02) and the placement of a greater number of stents (p = 0.044) correlated with a higher event rate. Logistic regression analysis showed that Type A lesions are the only predictors of the combined endpoint (p = 0.011).
A total of 50 responses (52%) were returned and the median number of device closures was 300 for all responders. While 80% of responders believe that NA exists, only 44% routinely inquire about NA prior to device closure and no responders perform skin testing prior to device closure. Slightly more than half of responders (58%) utilize antiplatelet medications (97% aspirin) in the days prior to device closure. Of the 50 survey responders having a total experience of 16,075 implants, 7 operators reported 33 cases of NA among 1,600 implants. Atrial septal defect closure was associated with all well-described cases of NA. Reaction occurred anywhere from 2 days up to 1 month after implantation and manifested as headaches, rash/urticaria, difficulty breathing, fever or pericardial effusion. All patients responded to medical management and no longer require medication.
Higher rates of hypertension (78.4% vs. 90.1%; p = 0.01), diabetes (37.9 vs. 45.1; p = 0.01) and previous coronary artery bypass grafts (10.3% vs. 19.4%; p = 0.04) in the PES group were observed, whereas in the SES group, there were more smokers (26.6% vs. 12.1%; p = 0.007) and a higher incidence of previous myocardial infarction (MI) (50% vs. 35.2%; p = 0.02). Procedural success and in-hospital MACE were similar in both groups. At follow up, there was a higher incidence of MACE (22.4% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.04) and target lesion revascularization (7.1% vs. 3.0%; p = 0.02) in the SES group compared to the PES group. The incidence of cardiac death and MI were comparable between the two groups, as well as the rate of stent thrombosis. After adjustment for clinical and angiographic characteristics, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between SES and PES.
The characteristics of patients were mostly of ischemic heart disease, 50-59 yr old, and male. Educational sessions were administered twice, and each lesson lasted less than 30 min. Exercise was done 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Most educational content were about risk factors, but there was no information, such as coping with feelings. Most exercise was performed as ROM, treadmill, and cycle ergometer. A large percentage of outcome indicators were health behavior, hemodynamic changes, and exercise capacity. There was more 'no effect' than 'positive effect' in trait anxiety and depression, whereas similar in physiologic domain.
The DS group showed significant increases (p&lt;.05) as compared to the steroid group in body weight, and muscle weight of gastrocnemius muscles. The EDS group showed significant increases (p&lt;.05) as compared to the S group in body weight, muscle weight, myofibrillar protein content, and Type II fiber cross-sectional area of soleus, plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles.
All variables except workload were positively correlated with job satisfaction. It was found that three task reward variables (workload, meaning, and participation), two organizational reward variables (security and promotional chances) and one social reward variable (family support) had significant influence on nurses' job satisfaction. The explained variance for job satisfaction was 41.4%. The data further indicate that task rewards were the most significant determinants of nurse job satisfaction.
The four main themes on the attributes of forest were "a lively living being", "placidity and tranquility", "acceptive atmosphere", and "beautifulness as it is" which revealed the participants' perceived nature of the forest which was attributed to the healing effects. Eight other themes on participants' positive changes included "revived senses", "aspired to live", "relieved and relaxed from being tense", "gaining insight on self", "having an acceptive attitude", "becoming compliant with his/her life", "learning that life is being together" and "recognizing the value of one's existence".
Of the patients, 38% were classified as type-D personality. Among the 10 subcategories of quality of life, the highest mean score was bodily pain (5.84+/-.85) and the lowest was role limitation (1.52+/-.20). Among 13 item of illness intrusiveness, the highest mean score was health (3.78+/-.73) and the lowest was family relationships (2.14+/-.58). There were significant differences in all the subcategories of quality of life between type-D and non type-D except for subcategories of bodily pain and role limitation. However, there were no significant differences in illness intrusiveness between type-D and non type-D.
Stress levels were significantly lower when the students received the aroma treatment compared to when they received the placebo treatment. The stress responses except salivary IgA levels were significantly lower when the students received the aroma treatment.
Among ninety two elders participated in the program, 59 were allocated to the case management group and 33 to the conventional group. The intervention, home health service by a nurse over a 3 month period, consisted of comprehensive assessment, case conference for care plan, direct care, education and referral, and outcome evaluation. The percent of elders whose function improved in the intervention group was greater than the conventional group for depression (odds ratio [OR]: 10.941, confidence interval [CI]: 2.338-51.206), IADL (OR: 4.423, CI: 1.151-16.999) and the number of CAP (OR: 11.443, CI: 3.805-34.410).
Smoking initiation and daily smoking were more pronounced when the participants entered middle school. In bivariate analysis, statistically significant predictors of smoking initiation were loneliness at school, self-control, delinquent behavior, depressive symptoms, and stress. However, after controlling for other factors, only a high level of risk-taking tendency and a greater number of delinquent behaviors remained statistically significant.
Total level of health literacy was relatively high (68.7%). Elders had high scores for taking medicines according to doctor's instruction, but lower ones for full comprehension through communication with doctors. Health status was high for emotional, physical, and social function in that order. There were significant differences between general characteristics and health status for gender, age, marital status, education, family, smoking, and alcohol consumption in that order. Results of multiple regression analysis for factors influencing health status showed that self-report health level was the most influential, followed by health literacy, age, gender.
Muscle weight of the unaffected plantaris muscle in the SNT group was significantly lower than in the other two groups. Type II fiber cross-sectional areas of the unaffected plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles in the SNT group were significantly smaller than in the other two groups. The decrease of muscle weights and Type I, II fiber cross-sectional areas of the unaffected three muscles in the SNT group were significantly less than that of the affected three muscles.
There was a significant difference in loneliness between the upper 25% and lower 25% groups of peer relationships, perceived parental rearing attitudes, and self-reported attachment security. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed affection-hostility in parental rearing attitudes, validation and conflict in peer relationships, and attachment security explained 39.6% of the total variance in loneliness.
The results indicated that individual level variables related to quality of service were age, cognitive ability, patient classification, and initial quality scores. The organizational level variables related to quality of service were ownership, number of beds, and turnover rate. The explanatory power of variables related to organizational level variances in quality of service was 23.72%.
Patients with restless legs syndrome had a higher rest-activity rhythm curve of Least 5 hr's activity (L5) and Most 10 hr's activity (M10) than those of normal group and sleep problems included decreased sleep efficiency and increased sleep latency, wake time and number of awakenings. The scores for the subscales of quality of life in patients with restless legs syndrome were lower than the normal group for general health, physical functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, role limitation due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality and mental health.
The patients experienced a mean of 2.22-2.23 symptoms out of 4 symptoms. Patients who were female, or suffered from breast or colorectal cancer experienced more symptoms. Fatigue at present, and most severe fatigue and anorexia in the previous 3 weeks increased significantly. Anxiety and QOL decreased significantly after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Number of symptoms, anorexia at present, most severe anorexia in past 3 weeks, and anxiety had negative correlations. QOL before chemotherapy showed a positive correlation with QOL after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. In a regression analysis, anxiety, QOL at baseline, income, and the most severe pain in the past 3 weeks were significant predictors of QOL.
Based on the constructed model, belief on substance use was found to have a significantly direct effect in influencing adolescent substance use. In addition, other factors such as family environment, satisfaction with school life, self-concept, social support, and personality vulnerability indirectly affected substance use. The final modified model yielded Chi-square=2,987 (p&lt;.001), df=121, chi(2)/df=22.1, GFI=.96, AGFI=.93, NFI=.91, PNFI=.72, PGFI=.72, RMSEA=.07 and exhibited fit indices.
We found 79 sequence variants, 29 of which were novel. Eight potentially or proven pathogenic mutations were found in 22 probands (9.7%). There were four novel amino acid substitutions that are potentially pathogenic (p.S52F, p.N363S, p.I810V, p.R1325Q) and two novel variants, p.H1216R and p.T1410M, that are probably not causative. The common p.G2019S mutation was identified in 13 probands (5.8%) including six from North Africa (43%). The known heterozygous p.R1441H and p.I1371V mutations were found in two probands each, and the p.E334K variant was identified in one single patient. Most potentially or proven pathogenic mutations were located in the functional domains of the Lrrk2 protein.
To identify new loci associated with mean leukocyte telomere length we conducted a genome wide association study of 314,075 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and validated the results in a second cohort (n for both cohorts combined = 2790). We identified two novel associated variants (rs2162440, p = 2.6 x 10(-6); and rs7235755, p = 5.5 x 10(-6)) on chromosome 18q12.2 in the same region as the VPS34/PIKC3C gene, which has been directly implicated in the pathway controlling telomere length variation in yeast.
We describe one known SPRED1 mutation (c.190C&gt;T leading to p.Arg64Stop) and four novel mutations (c.637C&gt;T leading to p.Gln213Stop, c.2T&gt;C leading to p.Met1Thr, c.46C&gt;T leading to p.Arg16Stop, and c.1048_1060del leading to p.Gly350fs) in five French families. Their NF1-like phenotype was characterised by a high prevalence of café-au-lait spots, freckling, learning disability, and an absence of neurofibromas and Lisch nodules in agreement with the original description. However, we did not observe Noonan-like dysmorphy. It is noteworthy that one patient with the p.Arg16Stop mutation developed a monoblastic acute leukaemia.
We conducted a retrospective review of the chest computed tomography (CT) of 45 female and 20 male patients with TSC and found cysts consistent with LAM in 22 (49%) women and two (10%) men. In the female population, changes consistent with LAM were observed in six of 15 (40%) patients with TSC1, 11 of 23 (48%) with TSC2, and five of seven (71%) with NMI. While the predominant size of cysts did not differ across these three groups, TSC2 women with LAM had a significantly greater number of cysts than did TSC1 patients (p = 0.010).
With adjustment for age, sex and centre, we detected a QTL influencing both HDL-C (logarithm of odds (LOD) = 4.4, genome-wide p = 0.001) and apo A-1 (LOD = 3.2, genome-wide p = 0.020) nearest marker D6S289 at 6p23 in the Arizona sample. Another QTL influencing apo A-1 was found nearest marker D9S287 at 9q22.2 (LOD = 3.0, genome-wide p = 0.033) in the North and South Dakotas. We detected a QTL influencing TG nearest marker D15S153 at 15q22.31 (LOD = 4.5 in the overall sample and LOD = 3.8 in the Dakotas sample, genome-wide p = 0.0044) and when additionally adjusted for waist, current smoking, current alcohol, current oestrogen, lipid treatment, impaired fasting glucose, and diabetes, nearest marker D10S217 at 10q26.2 (LOD = 3.7, genome-wide p = 0.0058) in the Arizona population.
We describe a FOXL2 variant (p.Gly187Asp) in a case of POF without BPES. The subcellular localisation of FOXL2-G187D was normal but its transactivation capacity tested on two reporter promoters, one of which should be relevant to the ovary, was significantly lower than that of normal FOXL2. However, FOXL2-G187D was able to activate strongly a reporter construct driven by the promoter of Osr2 (odd-skipped related 2 transcription factor), which we have suggested to be a crucial target of FOXL2 in the craniofacial region. This is compatible with the absence of BPES in our patient.
Association of anti-IA-2 with the HLA genes was detected at high statistical significance. HLA-DRB1*0401 confers both the strongest type 1 diabetes risk, and positive association of anti-IA-2, whereas the DRB1*03- DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype, associated less strongly with T1D, showed a significant negative association with anti-IA-2 positivity. Interestingly, HLA-A*24 is also negatively associated with anti-IA-2, independently of the DRB1*03- DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype. No statistically significant association was identified between anti-GAD65 and HLA.
177 aHUS patients and 70 healthy donors were studied. The number of CFHR1 alleles was quantified by multiplex ligation dependant probe amplification (MLPA). The frequency of the deleted allele was significantly higher in aHUS patients than in controls (22.7% vs 8.2%, p&lt;0.001). The highest frequency was in the subgroup of patients exhibiting anti-factor H (FH) autoantibodies (92.9%, p&lt;0.0001 vs controls) and in the group of patients exhibiting a factor I (CFI) gene mutation (31.8%, p&lt;0.001 vs controls). The CFHR1 deletion was not significantly more frequent in the cohort of aHUS patients when patients with anti-FH IgG or CFI mutation were excluded.
121 children were first screened for the common SFTPC mutation, p.Ile73Thr (I73T). Ten unrelated patients were shown to carry this mutation. The I73T mutation was inherited in six cases, and appeared de novo in four. The 111 patients without the I73T mutation were screened for the entire coding sequence of SFTPC. Of these, eight (seven unrelated) subjects were shown to carry a novel mutant allele of SFTPC. All these seven new mutations are located in the BRICHOS domain except the p.Val39Ala (V39A) mutation, which is in the surfactant protein C (SP-C) mature peptide.
SPRED1 mutations were identified in 6 cases; 5 were novel and included 3 nonsense (R16X, E73X, R262X), 2 frameshift (c.1048_c1049 delGG, c.149_1152del 4 bp), and a single missense mutation (V44D). Short direct or inverted repeats detected immediately adjacent to some SPRED1 mutations may have led to the formation of the microdeletions and base pair substitutions.
We describe 11 previously unreported patients expanding the phenotypic spectrum to include aortic root dilatation, recurrent joint subluxation, conductive hearing loss due to chronic otitis media, dental anomalies, and persistence of fetal fingertip pads. Molecular analysis of the deletions demonstrates a critical region spanning 440 kb involving either partially or wholly five genes, CRHR1, IMP5, MAPT, STH, and KIAA1267.
Wild-type huntingtin could bind to a number of nuclear receptors; LXRalpha, PPARgamma, VDR and TRalpha1. Over-expression of huntingtin activated, while knockout of huntingtin decreased, LXR mediated transcription of a reporter gene. Loss of huntingtin also decreased expression of the LXR target gene, ABCA1. In vivo, huntingtin deficient zebrafish had a severe phenotype and reduced expression of LXR regulated genes. An LXR agonist was able to partially rescue the phenotype and the expression of LXR target genes in huntingtin deficient zebrafish during early development.
Weekend admissions occurred among 27.5% of the 5667 patients with SAH in the NIS database. Weekend admission was not a statistically significant independent predictor of death in the SAH study population at 7 days (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91-1.25), 14 days (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87-1.17), or 30 days (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.19).
The sensor adequately recorded the coil insertion pressure during embolization. The presence of the sensor did not hinder the embolization procedure in any way. During embolization in the silicone aneurysm model, a sinusoid pattern of pressure occurred, reflecting actual clinical experience. Similar results were obtained in the in vivo study.
In Model 1, a clockwise, single-vortex flow pattern was observed in the aneurysm dome before stenting was performed. There were multiple vortices, and a very small fast flow stream was newly formed in the aneurysm dome after stenting. The mean intraaneurysmal flow velocity was reduced by approximately 23-40%. In Model 2, there was a clockwise vortex flow in the aneurysm dome and another small counterclockwise vortex in the tip of the aneurysm dome before stenting. The small vortex area disappeared after stenting, and the mean flow velocity in the aneurysm dome was reduced by 43-64%. In Model 3, a large, counterclockwise, single vortex was seen in the aneurysm dome before stenting. Multiple small vortices appeared in the aneurysm dome after stenting, and the mean flow velocity became slower by 22-51%.
Cerebral ischemic events after CEA were observed in 16 patients. Reduced signal intensity of the MCA on preoperative MR angiography was the only significant independent predictor of postoperative cerebral ischemic events. When the reduced MCA signal intensity on preoperative MR angiography was defined as an impairment in cerebral hemodynamics, MR angiography grading resulted in an 88% sensitivity and 63% specificity, with a 30% positive- and a 97% negative-predictive value for the development of postoperative cerebral ischemic events.
Intranasal administration of EPO plus IGF-I reduced stroke volumes within 24 hours and improved neurological function in mice up to 90 days after MCAO. The 125I-EPO and 125I-IGF-I were found in the brain within 20 minutes after intranasal administration and accumulated within the injured areas of the brain. In addition, intranasal administration delivered significantly higher levels of the applied 125I-EPO and 125I-IGF-I to the brain compared with intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration.
The literature search revealed 19 studies, but only 11 were included in this review, involving 1973 patients. The fenestrated and nonfenestrated cohorts (combined from the various studies) differed significantly with regard to patient sex, age, and clinical grade as well as aneurysm location (p=0.0065, 0.0028, 0.0003, and 0.017, respectively). The overall incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in the fenestrated cohort was 10%, as compared with 14% in the nonfenestrated cohort (p=0.089). The relative risk of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in the fenestrated cohort was 0.88 (95% CI 0.62-1.24).
In the high ICP group, extended ICP therapy including decompressive craniectomy was necessary in 7 patients (39%). Cerebral glycerol levels and the lactate/pyruvate ratio were pathologically increased on Days 1-7 after aSAH (p&lt;0.001). The excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate and glycerol, a marker of membrane degradation, further increased on Days 5-7, probably reflecting the development of secondary brain damage. An ICP&gt;or=20 mm Hg was shown to have a significant influence on the 12-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score (p=0.001) and was a strong predictor of mortality (OR=24.6; p&lt;0.001). Glutamate (p=0.012), the lactate/pyruvate ratio as a marker of anaerobic metabolism (p=0.028), age (p&lt;0.001), and Fisher grade (p=0.001) also influenced the GOS score at 12 months.
Cerebral blood flow at rest (CBFrest) significantly increased in the immediate postoperative stage before returning to normal levels over the long term; this trend was also recognized on the contralateral side. In contrast, there was gradual improvement in the rate of CBF variation on acetazolamide administration (% CBFaz). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CBF/cerebral blood volume) increased rapidly during the acute stage and decreased in the long term, and the oxygen extraction fraction decreased slightly during the acute stage before normalizing over the long term. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) increased slightly after stenting over both the short and long term. The ratios of ipsilateral to contralateral values (asymmetry index) for CBFrest, % CBFaz, cerebral blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and CMRO2 tended to approach 1.0 over time.
Seizures occurred in 20 patients with ICH, including acute symptomatic seizures in 9 and unprovoked seizures in 11. None progressed to status epilepticus during hospitalization. After a minimum 3-year follow-up period, the mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 3.8+/-1.1 for patients who had had seizures and 3.5+/-1.3 for those who had not. The multiple logistic regression model demonstrated that the mean ICH volume was independently associated with seizures, and any increase of 1 mm3 in ICH volume increased the seizure rate by 2.7%.
One small residual AVM identified intraoperatively necessitated further resection. One aneurysm was clipped during endovascular inflation of an intracarotid balloon for temporary proximal control. The completeness of treatment was confirmed on intraoperative 3D rotational angiography in all cases, and there were no procedure-related complications.
The smallest vessel occluded by the embolic agent was 5 microm in the Onyx group and 20 microm in the NBCA group. There was evidence of vascular or perivascular inflammation in 20 (90.9%) of 22 and 9 (90%) of 10 specimens after Onyx and NBCA embolization, respectively. Chronic foreign-body giant cells were observed in 12 (54.5%) of 22 specimens after Onyx embolization, but were absent in specimens after NBCA embolization. Angionecrosis of the embolized vessel was observed in 13 (59.1%) of 22 specimens and in 4 (40%) of 10 specimens after Onyx and NBCA embolization, respectively. There was evidence of recanalization in Onyx embolized vessels in 4 (18.2%) of 22 specimens, and there was no evidence of recanalization after NBCA embolization.
The SAC-SWS was successful without any treatment-related complications in all 11 patients. Immediate posttreatment angiograms revealed complete obliteration of the DA sac in 3 patients, near-complete obliteration in 7, and partial obliteration in 1. One patient died as a direct consequence of the initial SAH. All 10 surviving patients had excellent clinical outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale Score 5) without posttreatment rebleeding during a follow-up period of 8-24 months (mean follow-up 15 months). Angiographic follow-up at 6-12 months after treatment was possible at least once in all surviving patients. Nine VBA-DAs showed complete obliteration; the other aneurysm, which had appeared partially obliterated immediately after treatment, demonstrated progressive obliteration on 2 consecutive follow-up angiography studies. There was no in-stent stenosis or occlusion of the branch or perforating vessels.
One hundred twenty-five HydroSoft coils were deployed into 9 aneurysms without any technical problem. The mean volume % of the bare platinum coils, HydroCoils, and HydroSoft coils were 23.0+/-15.9, 63.0+/-23.5, and 13.9+/-8.9%, respectively. The mean aneurysm volumetric occlusion rate was 45.9%. At the 3-month follow-up angiography, 8 of 9 aneurysms remained stable and had not recanalized. Microscopically, most aneurysms showed complete endothelialization and thick neointima formation at the neck surface with no thrombus present.
The authors constructed several multivariate analysis models and demonstrated that for almost every model, country was not a significant predictor of outcome (p&gt;0.05). There was variation in outcome between countries, but this was mostly due to differences in other admission characteristics that influence outcome such as age, clinical grade, and subarachnoid clot thickness. Because the number of patients entered from some countries was small, countries were grouped, and the data were analyzed by continent. This grouping gave more stable estimates and created an appropriate model for both logistic and proportional odds models and again showed that continent had no significant effect on outcome.
The authors' semiautomatic algorithm consistently visualized the location of the descending motor pathways in patients with nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic vascular malformations. In 1 patient whose complete right hemiplegia (complete paralysis) was caused by a large left frontal hematoma that bisected the descending motor pathways, the authors were unable to reconstruct the motor pathways due to severe tract degeneration. However, in all cases in which motor function was intact or only mildly impaired, the technique clearly delineated the motor pathways, even in the presence of large anatomical displacement by the vascular abnormality or associated hemorrhage.
Within 6 months, 10 patients were enrolled in the study. The distal automated anastomosis could be accomplished in all patients; the median temporary occlusion time was 16.6+/-3.4 minutes. Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed good bypass function in 9 patients, and in 1 the anastomosis was classified as fair. There was 1 major perioperative complication that consisted of the creation of a pseudoaneurysm due to a hardware problem. In all but 1 case the bypass was shown to be patent on DSA after 7 days; furthermore, in 1 patient a late occlusion developed due to vasospasm after a sylvian hemorrhage. One-week follow-up DSA revealed transient asymptomatic extracranial spasm of the donor artery and the radial artery graft in 1 case. Two patients developed a limited zone of infarction on CT scanning during the follow-up course.
Randomization characteristics were balanced except for age, with the EPO group being older (mean age 59.6 vs 53.3 years, p=0.034). No differences were demonstrated in the incidence of vasospasm and adverse events; however, patients receiving EPO had a decreased incidence of severe vasospasm from 27.5 to 7.5% (p=0.037), reduced DIDs with new cerebral infarcts from 40.0 to 7.5% (p=0.001), a shortened duration of impaired autoregulation (ipsilateral side, p&lt;0.001), and more favorable outcome at discharge (favorable Glasgow Outcome Scale score, p=0.039). Among the 71 survivors, the EPO group had fewer deficits measured with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median Score 2 vs 6, p=0.008).
Treatment with GM-CSF significantly increased cell viability in a cell culture model of glutamate-induced neuronal injury. Furthermore, in vivo administration of GM-CSF at 60 microg/kg body weight daily for 5 consecutive days beginning immediately after injury decreased infarction volume, altered the expression of several apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3, and p53), and improved locomotor behavior in the focal cerebral ischemia model.
Sixty-seven patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years, underwent surgical treatment of an AVM between January 1, 1990, and December 30, 2005. In these patients, 31 AVMs (46%) had a distinct linear configuration that was centered on a dominant draining vein ("vein-based"). These AVMs presented with hemorrhage (61%), incidental findings on imaging (16%), or seizures (13%). In 4 cases, AVM recurrence was noted on angiographic follow-up after postoperative angiography showed no residual lesion. Recurrence was seen at 1 year in 2 cases, and at 3 and 11 years in 1 case each.
The total number of patients according to their craniosynostosis subtype were as follows: 1224 cases of scaphocephaly, 315 cases of plagiocephaly, 598 cases of trigonocephaly, 105 cases of brachycephaly, 69 cases of oxycephaly, 396 syndromic cases, and 101 unclassifiable cases. The prevalences of these craniosynostoses evolved differently over time. The number of children hospitalized each year increased over time from 106 to 181 cases, but this increase varied according to the subtype of craniosynostosis. Cases of scaphocephaly, plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, and syndromic cases increased similarly (170% increase on average), whereas trigonocephalies dramatically increased (420% increase).
Surgical untethering was performed in 66 patients with myelomeningoceles and 18 patients with lipomyelomeningoceles. Fourteen patients underwent multiple repeat spinal cord untethering. Patients were followed up for an average of 6.2 years. Most patients had stability of function postoperatively. Motor function and weakness improved in 7 and 16% of patients at 6 months, respectively, and 6 and 19% of patients at long-term follow-up evaluation, respectively. Of the patients who presented with back pain, 75% had improvement in symptoms at 6 months postoperatively. Younger age at untethering was significantly associated with worse long-term neurological outcomes. The number of previous untethering procedures, original diagnosis, sex, anatomical level, and degree of untethering had no effect on surgical outcomes.
The results of 82 ketamine administrations in 30 patients were analyzed. Overall, following ketamine administration, ICP decreased by 30% (from 25.8 +/- 8.4 to 18.0 +/- 8.5 mm Hg) (p &lt; 0.001) and CPP increased from 54.4 +/- 11.7 to 58.3 +/- 13.4 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.005). In Group 1, ICP decreased significantly following ketamine administration and increased by &gt; 2 mm Hg during the distressing intervention in only 1 of 17 events. In Group 2, when ketamine was administered to lower persistent intracranial hypertension, ICP decreased by 33% (from 26.0 +/- 9.1 to 17.5 +/- 9.1 mm Hg) (p &lt; 0.0001) following ketamine administration.
Thirty-one (86%) of 36 patients who received VSG shunts and 61 (69%) of 88 patients who received ventricular reservoirs received permanent CSF diversion with a shunt (p = 0.05). Five patients (14%) in the VSG shunt group had CSF infections during temporization, compared with 11 patients (13%) in the ventricular reservoir group (p = 0.83). The 6-month incidence of permanent shunt infection in the VSG shunt group was 16% (5 of 31), compared with 12% (7 of 61) in the reservoir placement group (p = 0.65). For the first 6 months after permanent shunt placement, infants with no preceding temporizing procedure had an infection rate of 5% (1 of 20 infants) and those who had undergone a temporizing procedure had an infection rate of 13% (12 of 92; p = 0.45).
After CSF diversion, the mean ADC decreased from a preoperative value of 1209 +/- 116 x 10(-6) mm(2)/second to a postoperative value of 928 +/- 64 x 10(-6) mm(2)/second (p &lt; 0.005). Differences between pre- and postoperative ADC values were most prominent in the periventricular white matter, supporting the existence of preoperative periventricular edema. Compared with age-related normal values, the preoperative ADC values were higher and the postoperative ADC values were lower, although within normal range. The decrease in ADC after CSF drainage was more rapid than the more gradual physiological decrease that is related to age. The preoperative ICP was elevated in all patients. After CSF diversion the ICP decreased significantly to within the normal range. A linear correlation between ADC values and ICP was found (correlation coefficient 0.496, p &lt; 0.001). In all patients the mean arterial blood pressure was within physiological limits both pre- and postoperatively.
The expression level of stathmin protein was &lt; or = 10% in 9 patients, 11-50% in 1, and &gt; 50% in 3. No staining was seen in the tissues adjacent to the tumors. For comparison, the authors grouped the expression level of stathmin into high (&gt; 50%) and low (&lt; or = 50%). It was found that patients with high expression of stathmin had more frequent tumor dissemination at the time of resection or soon after total excision of the tumor (p = 0.0035), and hence experienced a fulminant course with lower patient survival (p &lt; 0.0001), with an average survival period of 6.7 months (range 2-10 months). The expression level of stathmin did not correlate with patient age, sex, CSF cytological findings, use of adjuvant therapies, Ki 67 index, or risk classification of the tumors according to previously described categories in the literature.
Of the 24 cases, 21 had signal intensity on FLAIR images that differed from that of CSF. Of the 10 cases with FIESTA, 6 had evidence of internal structure within the pineal cyst. The authors found it of interest that 20 of the 24 patients were female.
Of the 31 patients, 17 were treated with a brace, 9 of whom had curve progression and went on to other forms of treatment. Of the 8 who did respond, there was an overall improvement of 51.2%. The 10 patients who received body casts, who had a mean preoperative Cobb angle of 50.4 degrees, demonstrated an average correction of 59.0%, with only a few skin irritations reported. The 10 patients treated with VEPTR devices demonstrated a mean preoperative Cobb angle of 90.0 degrees, and an average correction of 33.8% was attained. Three of the VEPTR-treated patients (33%) experienced minor problems.
The study group was composed of 5 male and 3 female patients (mean age 24 years, age range 8-54 years). All patients presented with the physical features of short neck, torticollis, pain in the nape of the neck, and varying degrees of quadriparesis. In 6 patients there was a history of trauma prior to the onset of major neurological symptoms. The dislocation was mild in 3 cases, moderate in 1, and severe in 4. All patients had clinical neurological improvement following surgery. The follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 30 months (mean 18 months).
One-hundred consecutive screws were placed in the pedicle of the axis by a single surgeon using external landmarks only. In 10 cases, only 1 screw was placed because of a preexisting VA anatomy or bone abnormality noted preoperatively. In no case was screw placement aborted because of complications noted during drilling. Early complications occurred in 2 patients and were limited to 1 wound infection and 1 transient C-2 radiculopathy. There were 15 total breaches (15%), 2 of which occurred in the same patient. Twelve breaches were lateral (80%), and 3 were superior (20%). There were no medial breaches. The magnitude of the breach was classified as I in 10 cases (66.7% of breaches), II in 3 cases (20% of breaches), III in 1 case (6.7%), and IV in 1 case (6.7%).
Using lamina screws as a salvage technique generated mean pullout forces (778.9 +/- 161.4 N) similar to that of the index pedicle screws (805.3 +/- 261.7 N; p = 0.796). However, mean lamina screw peak IT (5.2 +/- 2.0 lbs/in) was significantly lower than mean index pedicle screw peak IT (9.1 +/- 3.6 lbs/in; p = 0.012). Bone mineral density was strongly correlated with pedicle screw pullout strength (r = 0.95) but less with lamina screw pullout strength (r = 0.04). The mean lamina width measured using calipers (5.7 +/- 1.0 mm) was significantly different from the CT-measured mean lamina width (5.1 +/- 0.8 mm; p = 0.003). Similarly, the mean pedicle width recorded with calipers (6.6 +/- 1.1 mm) was significantly different from the CT-measured mean pedicle width (6.2 +/- 1.3 mm; p = 0.014). The mean laminar width measured on CT at the thinnest point ranged from 3.8 to 6.8 mm, allowing a 3.5-mm screw to be placed without difficulty.
The study population consisted of 217 patients who were hospitalized for CST. The average incidence rate was 21.6 cases annually or 1.8 cases monthly. The mean patient age was 36.75 years. The 20-40-year-old age bracket was found to be most highly represented, corresponding to 52.6% of total patients. Patients were predominantly male; 191 patients (88.01%) were male compared with only 26 female patients (11.99%). The ratio of men to women was 7.35:1. Injuries in the craniocervical region corresponded to 43 (19.8%) of the cases; injuries in the cervical subaxial region corresponded to 174 (80.2%) of the cases and were associated with worse neurological lesions. Additionally, 40.6% of patients presented with complications in other organs and systems; several patients presented with multiple complications, and 33 patients (15.02%) died. During the hospitalization period, 4 patients presenting as Grade A on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scale evolved to Grade C, 1 patient presenting as ASIA Grade A evolved to Grade B, and 2 patients evolved to Grade E. Two patients who had been admitted without neurological lesions evolved to ASIA Grade C (1 patient postsurgery and 1 patient post-traction). Two patients presenting initially as ASIA Grade E evolved to Grade D, and another to central cord syndrome. On average, patients with incomplete lesions improved 1 grade in ASIA classification during hospitalization.
In 11 patients (0.4%), MR imaging findings of unusual sequestered disc fragments were mistaken for another spinal space-occupying lesion. In 8 cases, the fragments had migrated to the posterior spinal space; in 3 cases, into the dural sac. In 3 patients, the fragments were distant from the original disc space. A heterogeneous mass was revealed with low-intensity or isointense signal on T1-weighted MR images as well as low signal (4 cases) or high signal (7 cases) intensity on T2-weighted images, relative to the spinal structures. A slight diffuse or peripheral Gd enhancement rim was observed in 7 patients. Disc fragments were located in the cervical (1 patient), thoracic (2 patients), and lumbar (8 patients) spine. All lesions were completely removed. Discectomy was required in 4 patients. A complete recovery occurred in 8 patients and a minor neurological deficit remained in 3.
Twenty-seven patients with primary lung cancer, 26 with breast cancer, 20 with prostate cancer, 21 with kidney cancer, 13 with GI cancer, and 7 with melanoma were identified and categorized. All of these patients were followed up for a mean +/- SD of 10.8 +/- 3.8 months following surgery. Patients with primary lung and prostate cancers were typically older than patients with other types of primary cancers. Patients with prostate cancer had the shortest duration of symptoms and more commonly presented with motor deficits, while patients with breast cancer more commonly had cervical spine involvement and compression fractures. For all histological types, &gt; 90% of patients retained the ability to ambulate following surgery. However, the group with the highest percentage of patients who regained ambulatory function after decompressive surgery was the lung cancer group. Patients with breast or kidney cancer and those with melanoma had the highest median duration of survival following decompressive surgery.
The latencies of lumbar SSEPs in patients with LSS and in the control group were 23.0 +/- 2.0 ms and 21.6 +/- 1.9 ms, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the LSS and control groups (p &lt; 0.05). The latency of lumbar SSEPs was significant correlated with the VAS score of leg numbness (p &lt; 0.05). The latency of lumbar SSEPs in LSS was clearly delayed when the VAS score of leg numbness was &gt; or = 8 (p &lt; 0.05).
In terms of target tissues, the VA branches encountered at the C1-2 level were most likely to be muscular, branches at C2-3 osseous, and those at C3-6 radicular. No radicular or medullary branches were identified arising from any V3 segment of the VA or C1-2 level of the V2 segment. The greatest concentration of branches per level was found arising from the V2 segment at C2-3. Posterior branches of the VA tended to be radicular or muscular, whereas anterior branches tended to be radicular or osseous. Lateral branches were most commonly radicular and medial branches tended to be osseous or muscular in nature. The largest branches of the VA originated from its V3 segment or the C2-3 part of its V2 segment. Rarely, branches to the extracranial glossopharyngeal and spinal accessory nerves were identified originating from the V3 and V2 segments of the VA, respectively.
4 cases with liver failure showed low activities and protein levels of complex I, III and IV. We also performed qPCR and estimated the ratio mtDNA/nDNA using these samples. They all exhibited extremely low ratio. They were diagnosed as mtDNA depletion syndrome. All cases except MMA cases exhibited mildly or moderately suppressed activities of complex I-IV. However, the respective protein levels remained almost normal. MMA cases exhibited low activities and protein levels of complex I, III and IV. In particular, their low activities and protein levels of complex I were noticeable. They all exhibited normal ratios of mtDNA to nDNA.
Because the differences of CBC values among different subgroups were not remarkable, we established the reference intervals as follows without subgroup division: Hb, 9.0-14.4 g/dL; WBC count, 5.6-18.5 x 10(3)/microL; differential count of WBC (neutrophils, 40.8-72.4%; lymphocytes, 17.2-46.7%; monocytes, 4.9-12.8%; eosinophils, 0.7-7.0%; basophils, 0.0-1.6%); platelet, 130-287 x 10(3)/microL; nRBCs, 0.0-13.1/100 WBC.
Out of 41,137 patients who had a hematology profile performed, 5,019 (12.2%) and 373 patients (0.9%) were found to have eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia, respectively. Among patients with hypereosinophilia, 227 patients (60.9%) had identifiable and/or possible causes. The major causes of hypereosinophilia were malignancy (35.2%), allergy and skin diseases (18.1%), infectious diseases (15.4%), hepatobiliary diseases (7.5%), bone marrow clonal diseases (6.6%) and parasite infections (6.6%). We also found a rare case of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia combined with light chain multiple myeloma.
When the criterion of a &gt; or =7 mm increase of inhibition zone around the IPM disk on the MHA containing DPA compared to MHA without DPA was used, the sensitivities and specificities were 94.7% and 97.6% for 200 microg/mL DPA-MHA biplate, and 98.2% and 97.6% for 300 microg/mL DPA-MHA biplate, respectively. The activity of the DPA in this biplate was stable for three months.
The overall essential agreement of MICs (within one dilution of MICs) defined by the Phoenix and Etest was 92.3%. Neither very major errors nor major errors were produced, and minor errors were 6.5%. Minor errors were frequently observed in susceptibility testings for penicillin (22.1%), cefotaxime (12.4%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (11.5%).
Double-disk synergy tests were positive in 84.3% (118/140) of ceftazidime- and/or cefotaxime-nonsusceptible E. coli isolates. The most prevalent types of ESBL in E. coli isolates were CTX-M-14 (N=41) and CTX-M-15 (N=58). Other ESBLs were also identified, including CTX-M-3 (N=7), CTX-M-9 (N=8), CTX-M-12 (N=1), CTX-M-57 (N=1), SHV-2a (N=2), SHV-12 (N=17) and TEM-52 (N=4). The qnrA1 and qnrB4 genes were identified in 4 and 7 ESBL-producing isolates, respectively.
Eleven of the 16 patients showed multiple mutations in the "a" determinant. These patients received liver transplantation several years ago and have been treated with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and antiviral drugs. G145R mutation was found in 8 patients and G145K, D144G, and D144A were also frequently found. Among 9 of the 11 patients tested for HBsAg by Architect HBsAg kit, 8 showed positive results. Among 4 of the remaining 5 patients, only 2 showed weak positive results (&lt; or = 1 IU/mL) in Architect HBsAg kit.
The genotypes of the 127 samples were found to be A101/A102 (n=1), A102/A102 (n=9), A101/O01 (n=3), A102/O01 (n=12), A102/O02 (n=14), B101/B101 (n=5), B101/O01 (n=18), B101/O02 (n=15), O01/O01 (n=14), O02/O02 (n=8), O01/O02 (n=14) and A102/B101 (n=14), from which phenotypes were calculated to be A (n=39), B (n=38), O (n=36) and AB (n=14). The multiplex ASPCR assay results were compared with the serologically determined blood group phenotypes and genotypes determined by DNA sequencing, and there were no discrepancies.
JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 30 cases, including 10 of 11 cases (91%) of polycythemia vera (PV), 13 of 20 cases (65%) of essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 2 of 3 cases (67%) of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). The concordance rate between the two tests was 95% (38/40). JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden was greater than 50% in 17 cases, and 10 of them (59%) were PV. In contrast, mutant allele burden was less than 50% in 13 cases and 11 of them (85%) were ET.
Plasma hnRPN B1 mRNA was measurable in 93.3% (28/30) of NSCLC patients. Normalized 2-DeltaDeltaCt of plasma hnRPN B1 mRNA was 62.2 (95%Cl, 6.4-210.1) in NSCLC patients and 2.7 (95%Cl, 0.5-13.6) in benign lung disease patients (P&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test).
Eleven specimens (36.7%) in buffer-free containers converted to negative results (below the 100 ng/mL) after 24 hr and 17 specimens (56.7%) did after 48 hr at room temperature. Ten specimens (33.3%) in buffer-free containers converted to negative after 48 hr at 4 degrees C. Specimens contained in buffer-tubes showed little change; 3 specimens (10.0%) at room temperature and no specimen at 4 degrees C showed negative conversions after 48 hr.
Sensitivity for preoperative ultrasonographic and scintigraphic scanning was 67% and 65% for identification of the correct quadrant and 74% and 71% for identification of the correct side. A bilateral exploration was performed until June 2001 for all patients. Thereafter, a minimally invasive approach was chosen for patients with pHPT, whereas patients with sHPT still require bilateral exploration. Adequate preoperative localization was a prerequisite for a minimally invasive technique. Mean postoperative serum Kalzium levels were within the normal range, independently of the surgical technique and disease. Two patients developed hypercalcemia after an initially successful operation.
Overall, the Non-APD-group scored significantly better than the (C)APD-group with the exception of three non-verbal auditory tests. The clinical group and the control group were successfully differentiated: 94% and (after cross-validation) 91% of the children respectively could be diagnosed correctly by using only three tests (significant discriminant function). Of these, Mottier's Test (nonword repetition) showed the highest discriminatory power followed by speech in noise discrimination and "phoneme differentiation" of the Heidelberger Phoneme Discrimination Test.
The DWI score and ASPECTS tended to be lower in the deteriorated group than the non-deteriorated group. In addition, with a cutoff value&lt;or=7, the DWI score could discriminate the deteriorated group from the non-deteriorated group with a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 87.5%, whereas for ASPECTS, sensitivity was 50% and specificity, 81.2%. The DWI score, ASPECTS, and DWI volume had no correlation with NIHSS score but weak negative correlations with the DWI volume (P&lt;0.01; Spearman's test). Comparing initial NIHSS score with each DWI score and DWI volume, the non-deteriorated group tended to have higher DWI scores and smaller DWI volumes than the deteriorated group, but there was no statistical difference between initial NIHSS and DWI scores. Though the DWI score was not statistically different, the threshold would be set to 6 points or above. Comparing initial DWI score with volume, patients with low DWI scores tended to show large variation in DWI volume and patients with small DWI volume showed large variation in DWI scores. There was no relation between hemorrhagic change and symptoms in either group.
The widths of the dip of the lower third of the bottom to head on the profile curve were consistent with actual measurement at 1-2 mm, the usual coronary artery wall thickness. Carotid plaques of high intensity by T(1)-weighted black-blood (T(1)BB) and T(2)-weighted BB (T(2)BB) methods showed high intensity on WS-SPAIR (TI 400 ms) 3D T(1) TFE and low intensity on WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE. With or without vulnerable plaque in the coronary artery wall, MIF of WHCA and WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE reflected the coronary artery wall. We obtained bands of low intensity in MIF between epicardial fat of WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE and coronary artery lumen of WHCA all but mid RCA in all 18 cases. We were unable to detect mid RCA in 5 cases. The outline of the obstructed mid RCA in 1 case was clear in WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE. The higher velocity of RCA movement caused blurring in another 4 cases in both WHCA and WS-SPIR 3D T(1) TFE. Those wall thickness of proximal or mid RCA averaged 1.3+/-0.2 mm.
The supraspinatus CSAs were maximal at 0.7 for all groups. The infraspinatus CSAs were maximal at 0.5 for normal men and women and badminton players, 0.4- and 0.5 locations for swimmers, and 0.4 for rowers. The teres minor CSAs were maximal at 0.9 for all groups except the swimmers (1 location). The subscapularis CSAs were maximal at 0.7 in men, swimmers, and badminton players and 0.6 in women and rowers.
We used diluted xenon from the CF-HP system to acquire 3D HP (129)Xe MR images of the mouse lung that were undiminished under spontaneous respiration. The averaged tau'(rep) values were longer for the emphysematous lungs than for the healthy lungs, which reflected ventilation defects in the emphysematous lung.
Patients who had received rh-APC exhibited significantly more impairments in fibrinolysis at baseline (PAI-1 activity 49.76 [24.61-71.82] vs 21.92 [6.47-55-83] IU/mL, P=0.03). The reductions in plasma PAI-1 activity over time associated with rh-APC treatment were different according to whether the treatment was administered to patients undergoing conventional or TGC (P=0.01). However, the most prominent reductions were in patients undergoing conventional glycemic control. Significant interactions between the two study interventions were also found for PAI-1 concentration (P&lt;0.001), C-reactive protein (P=0.02), and interleukin-6 levels (P&lt;0.001).
Out of 115 nurses, 90 completed the questionnaire (78.3%). Of this group, 67% did not feel involved in the decision-making process, and half felt they were inadequately informed. Approximately one third reported that they did not have adequate consultations with the doctors in the ward or with the MET. Only 13% of the nurses stated that the training was adequate (0% in medical wards).
Of the 100 total patients enrolled, five drop-outs were recorded in the SA group. By comparing the LA+TCI and SA groups, it was determined that the time to an Aldrete &gt; or =9 score from the end of the procedure was 25+/-27 vs 34+/-54 min (P=0.330); the time to a PADSS 9 score was 113+/-58 vs 181+/-65 min (P&lt;0.001); actual discharge occurred after 236+/-83 vs 289+/-78 min (P&lt;0.01).
The experiments showed that ocular volumes were significantly reduced in fetal mice where dams were treated with either TNP-470 or AS(4.5). Furthermore, TNP-470 specifically caused a reduction in hyaloid blood vessel length and volume, the only intraocular vascular circulation in fetal mice.
Serum samples from 26 of 37 patients (70%) with idiopathic but not secondary membranous nephropathy specifically identified a 185-kD glycoprotein in nonreduced glomerular extract. Mass spectrometry of the reactive protein band detected the M-type phospholipase A(2) receptor (PLA(2)R). Reactive serum specimens recognized recombinant PLA(2)R and bound the same 185-kD glomerular protein as did the monospecific anti-PLA(2)R antibody. Anti-PLA(2)R autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with membranous nephropathy were mainly IgG4, the predominant immunoglobulin subclass in glomerular deposits. PLA(2)R was expressed in podocytes in normal human glomeruli and colocalized with IgG4 in immune deposits in glomeruli of patients with membranous nephropathy. IgG eluted from such deposits in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, but not in those with lupus membranous or IgA nephropathy, recognized PLA(2)R.
We identified 433,985 patients who underwent in-hospital CPR; 18.3% of these patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2 to 18.5) survived to discharge. The rate of survival did not change substantially during the period from 1992 through 2005. The overall incidence of CPR was 2.73 events per 1000 admissions; the incidence was higher among black and other nonwhite patients. The proportion of patients undergoing in-hospital CPR before death increased over time and was higher for nonwhite patients. The survival rate was lower among patients who were men, were older, had more coexisting illnesses, or were admitted from a skilled-nursing facility. The adjusted odds of survival for black patients were 23.6% lower than those for similar white patients (95% CI, 21.2 to 25.9). The association between race and survival was partially explained by hospital effects: black patients were more likely to undergo CPR in hospitals that have lower rates of post-CPR survival. Among patients surviving in-hospital CPR, the proportion of patients discharged home rather than to a health care facility decreased over time.
From January 2002 through February 2007, we randomly assigned 98 patients to the PET-CT group and 91 to the conventional-staging group. Mediastinoscopy was performed in 94% of the patients. After PET-CT, 38 patients were classified as having inoperable NSCLC, and after conventional staging, 18 patients were classified thus. Sixty patients in the PET-CT group and 73 in the conventional-staging group underwent thoracotomy (P=0.004). Among these thoracotomies, 21 in the PET-CT group and 38 in the conventional-staging group were futile (P=0.05). The number of justified thoracotomies and survival were similar in the two groups.
A total of 90% and 82% of patients had complete renal-biopsy and retinopathy data, respectively. Change in mesangial fractional volume per glomerulus over the 5-year period did not differ significantly between the placebo group (0.016 units) and the enalapril group (0.005, P=0.38) or the losartan group (0.026, P=0.26), nor were there significant treatment benefits for other biopsy-assessed renal structural variables. The 5-year cumulative incidence of microalbuminuria was 6% in the placebo group; the incidence was higher with losartan (17%, P=0.01 by the log-rank test) but not with enalapril (4%, P=0.96 by the log-rank test). As compared with placebo, the odds of retinopathy progression by two steps or more was reduced by 65% with enalapril (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14 to 0.85) and by 70% with losartan (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.73), independently of changes in blood pressure. There were three biopsy-related serious adverse events that completely resolved. Chronic cough occurred in 12 patients receiving enalapril, 6 receiving losartan, and 4 receiving placebo.
Between December 2005 and December 2007, as compared with the increase in the no-cap group, the increase in total monthly drug spending was $41 higher (95% confidence interval [CI], $33 to $50) (74%) among enrollees with no previous drug coverage, $27 higher (95% CI, $20 to $34) (27%) among those with a previous $150 quarterly cap, and $13 higher (95% CI, $8 to $18) (11%) among those with a previous $350 cap. The use of both lipid-lowering and antidiabetic medications rose in the groups with no or minimal previous drug coverage. As compared with expenditures in the no-cap group, monthly medical expenditures (excluding drugs) were $33 lower (95% CI, $29 to $37) in the group with no previous coverage and $46 lower (95% CI, $29 to $63) in the group with a previous $150 quarterly cap, whereas medical spending was $30 higher (95% CI, $25 to $36) in the group with a previous $350 cap.
The diurnal variation in salivary cortisol concentrations in healthy school-aged boys and girls are described and show dependence to different degrees of age and sex.
Small regions of primary motor cortex (&lt; 5 mm) carry sufficient information to separate multiple aspects of motor movements (that is, wrist flexion/extension and ipsilateral/contralateral movements).
Movement-related cortical potentials could be accurately differentiated from rest with very high accuracy (83-96%). Further distinguishing the movement direction (up, down, left, or right) could also be resolved with high accuracy (58-86%) using information only from the high-gamma range, whereas distinguishing the trigger condition from the remaining directions provided better accuracy.
The newly developed multifunctional neural probes were successfully inserted into rat cortex and were able to deliver fluids and drugs that resulted in the expected electrophysiological and histological responses. The damage from insertion of the device into brain tissue was substantially less than the volume of drug dispersion in tissue. Electrophysiological activity, including both individual spikes as well as local field potentials, was successfully recorded with this device during real-time drug delivery. No significant changes were seen in response to delivery of aCSF as a control experiment, whereas delivery of TTX produced the expected result of suppressing all spiking activity in the vicinity of the catheter outlet.
Correlation analysis revealed decreasing signal correlation with distance. The gamma-band power during motor planning allowed binary classification of gross directionality in the reaching movements. The degree of power change was correlated to the underlying gyral pattern.
After obesity surgery, a consistent and continuous decline in all carotenoids to almost undetectable levels occurs, especially in those who underwent BPD diversion who, on average, displayed serum levels about one half to one third of those found in RYGBP patients.
Obese patients before surgery had approximately twofold higher serum phenylalanine concentration than control subjects. The serum phenylalanine concentration decreased 6 months after bariatric surgery. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration was higher in obese patients before surgery, and decreased 6 months after bariatric surgery. Changes in serum phenylalanine concentration correlated positively with changes of ALT concentration (r = 0.75; p &lt; 0.001). The body weight, BMI, HOMA-IR, serum triacylglycerol, LDL-cholesterol/HLD-cholesterol ratio, leptin, insulin, and glucose concentrations were higher in obese patients, and decreased 6 months after bariatric surgery. Serum HDL-cholesterol concentration was lower in obese patients before surgery than in control subjects and increased 6 months after surgery.
All but five patients lost more than 15% of initial weight; the mean loss of excess weight was 65.2 +/- 26.4% at 2 years. Plasma concentrations of albumin and transthyretin decreased after surgery, but while albumin returned to initial values after 12 months, transthyretin remained low. Only one patient had an albumin below 30 g/l; another one had a transthyretin lower than 110 mg/l. All NRI scores were lower than 83.5 (62 +/- 5, ranging 44-70), qualifying patients for severe malnutrition.
Rats in the SG group received a moderate body weight decrease (191 +/- 16.2 g) in the first 10 days, while this did not happen in the other two groups (213 +/- 13.7 g and 243 +/- 11.9 g). At the sacrifice date, weight of rats in the SG group was still much lower than those in the HD group. Plasma triglycerol (102.3 +/- 18.6 mg/dL) and cholesterol (84.3 +/- 6.1 mg/dL) of rats in the SG group were much lower than those in the HD group (198.5 +/- 18.5 mg/dL, 133.9 +/- 22.0 mg/dL). Under the fluorescence microscope, adipose infiltration was very obvious in the liver of the HD animals, while adipose infiltration was not serious in the SG group.
Eighty-nine women and 11 men underwent LRYGB and their BP monitored for 1 year. There was an 85% follow-up rate with mean % excess body weight loss of 60. Reductions in systolic (9 mmHg) and diastolic (7 mmHg) BP measurements were seen as early as week 1 postoperatively and maintained for the duration of the observation period (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, postoperative usage of antihypertensive medication is reduced to a third of preoperative use.
All patients had a normal postoperative course. Body temperature showed no change. White blood cells increased significantly at the first and third day after surgery but normalized by the fifth day. However, the third day after surgery, laparotomic gastric bypass patients showed a significantly greater increase in the total white blood cell count as well as in segmented neutrophil cells compared to laparoscopic surgery patients. CRP exhibited a similar increase and was more pronounced after a laparotomic approach.
Sixty-six of the 75 patients were female. The mean age at the time of revision was 46.32 (22-68) years. Mean initial weight was 119.08 kg, and body mass index (BMI) was 43.42 kg/m(2). The lowest BMI and excess weight loss (EWL) recorded after primary surgery was 36.9% and 53.5%, respectively. At the time of revision, the mean EWL was 24.79. The EWL at 3 months and 6 months were 41.7% and 47.8%, respectively. Revision was performed laparoscopically in 51 patients and via laparotomy in 24 patients. There was no mortality in the cohort, but there were 17.3% minor and 4.0% major perioperative morbidities.
The HL activity and HL-mRNA in morbidly obese (MO) livers were high (258 +/- 17 mU/g, and 4.5-fold, respectively); after surgery, the activity decreased (137 +/- 15 mU/g, p &lt; 0.001) but not the levels of HL-mRNA (4.3-fold). Plasma HL activity was also high (4.31 +/- 0.94 mU/mL plasma), and it decreased during weight loss (2.01 +/- 0.29 mU/mL, p &lt; 0.01); moreover, it correlated (r = 0.3694, p &lt; 0.05) with decreased liver HL activity. Adrenocorticotropic hormone in MO was higher (27 +/- 3 pg/mL) than after surgery (13 +/- 1 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.001). All hepatic and plasma lipids were significantly increased in MO patients, but, after bariatric surgery, most of those parameters recovered or normalized. Liver HL activity correlated with total and esterified cholesterol (r = 0.4399, p &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.4395, p &lt; 0.01, respectively).
We report a small series of sleeve gastrectomy using this specimen extraction technique. No wound infections were seen, and enlargement of the fascial incision was done only once, early in our experience.
The preoperative weight was 146 kg (range 108-202 kg). The average weight loss was 21 kg between the banding and the examination. The half time (T (50%)) for the pouch emptying was 3 min (quartiles 3-12.5) and the time to 90% of pouch emptying (T (90%)) was 40 min (24.5-60). The sensation of satiety lasted 75 min (57.5-105), and the feeling of hunger started after 90 min (40-90). Neither T (50%) nor T (90%) correlated to the weight loss (R = 0.006, P &gt; 0.5 and R = 0.1, P &gt; 0.5). The sensation of satiety did not correlate to T (50%) or T (90%) (R = 0.6, P = 0.12 and R = 0.5, P = 0.15). No association was found between the sensory data and the pressure decline. Significant association was found between the load of the meal expressed as the area under the pouch pressure curve and the weight loss (R = 0.786, P = 0.015).
Staple line leaks occurred in six patients (mean BMI 52.5; mean age 41.6 years). Leak presentation was early in three cases (first, second, and third postoperative (PO) day), late in the remaining three cases (11th, 22nd, and 30th PO day). The most common leak location was at the esophagogastric junction (five cases). Mortality was nihil. Nonoperative management (total parenteral nutrition, proton pump inhibitor, and antibiotics) was adopted in all cases. Percutaneous abdominal drainage was placed in five patients. In one case, a small fistula was successfully treated by endoscopic injection of fibrin glue only. Self-expandable covered stent was used in three cases. Complete healing of leaks was obtained in all patients (mean healing time 71 days).
One hundred twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study (77% women, mean BMI 49 kg/m(2)). One hundred thirty-four out of 233 children/grandchildren identified had complete data; 41% had a BMI percentile &gt; or =95. Only 29% of these obese children were so identified by the adult respondents. Significantly more biological children/grandchildren were obese than nonbiological (p = 0.013), and significantly more biological children were obese than biological grandchildren (p = 0.027).
We found out that the RMR of the weight regain group was statistically inferior to the mean of the healthy weight group-the difference between the two groups was about 260 kcal/day. We also found out that the predictive formulas overestimate the RMR in the weight regain group.
A year after surgery, BMD significantly decreased at the femoral neck (10.2 +/- 5.7%) and at the lumbar spine (3.2 +/- 4.4%). In the follow-up, 16.1% of women had osteopenia at the femoral neck and 19.3% at the lumbar spine, and 1.6% developed osteoporosis at the lumbar spine. Patients with bone disease were significantly older; the percentage of women with menopause was greater in this group and had lower initial and final values of lean mass. However, no differences in body mass index, weight loss, fat mass, calcium, PTH, 25(OH) D(3) or IGF-I values were found between groups. In the logistic regression analysis, lean mass 12 months after surgery and menopause were found to be the main determinants of osteopenia after adjusting for age with odds ratios of 0.82 and 9.13, respectively.
Overall, 3,122 bariatric procedures were performed at 38 German hospitals between January 2005 and December 2007. These procedures were subdivided into 2,869 primary operations and 253 revisions (sex ratio, male to female = 25.6:74.4%). The average BMI of all patients was 48.5 kg/m(2) in 2005, 48.4 kg/m(2) in 2006, and 48.0 kg/m(2) in 2007. In 2005 and 2006, gastric banding (GB) was the most commonly performed operation, followed by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). In 2007, RYGBP was carried out in 42.1% of all bariatric procedures. Interestingly, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was only 0.06%, whereas PE occurred in 0.06% of patients only after hospital discharge. The DVT prophylaxis protocol used has been changed for the last 2 years: the majority of patients with a BMI above 50 kg/m(2) received low-molecular-weight heparin twice a day.
The intraluminal pressure at the level of LAGB was a mean of 26.9 (19.8) mm Hg. This pressure varied depending on the volume within the LAGB and was separate to and distal to the lower esophageal sphincter LES. The LES was attenuated compared to controls (10 vs 18 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.01) although relaxed normally. Esophageal motility was well preserved at optimal volume compared to 20% overfilled, with 77% normal swallows vs 51%, p = 0.008. Repetitive esophageal contractions were observed in 40% of swallows at optimal volume compared to 16% in controls, p = 0.024. In comparison to controls, the transit of liquid, 21 vs 8 s (p &lt; 0.001), and semisolids, 50 vs 16 s (p &lt; 0.001), was delayed.
A total of 107 obese patients were studied. Ninety patients had no complications; 17 had at least one infectious complication which include five cases of staple line dehiscence. Until the third postoperative day, the vital signs and the leukogram did not predict the onset of infectious complications, but the cytokines (interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6) were early markers of these complications.
In average, patients presented 18.7% and 63.2% excess body weight loss 1 and 18 months after LAGB, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). CRP and total cholesterol mean levels were elevated (1.03 +/- 1.11 mg dL(-1) and 2.02 +/- 0.41 g L(-1)) at the presurgery study. CRP mean levels were significantly reduced when compared to reference range (p &lt; 0.01) 18 months after the LAGB surgery. Prealbumin as well as serum total protein mean levels decreased 1 month after surgery (p &lt; 0.01) and values returned to normal at 18 months after surgery. Albumin mean levels showed an increase during the postsurgery evaluations. Serum IgA and IgM concentrations were significantly increased at 1 month after surgery compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.01, both cases).
A significant interaction of group (bariatric surgery candidates/normal-weight controls) by blocked trials [F (4, 200) = 3.0; p &lt; 0.05] indicated that the groups differed in their pattern of salivary responding, with bariatric surgery candidates' salivation (grams) failing to decrease significantly over the five blocked trials (-0.47 +/- 0.18, p = 0.12), unlike that of the normal-weight controls (-1.30 +/- 0.25, p &lt; 0.001).
In both men and women, there was a significant negative correlation between estimated Framingham risk and both eGFR and CrCl (p &lt; 0.001 for all correlations). When men were divided according to creatinine tertiles, there were no significant differences in any parameter between groups. When men were divided according to either eGFR or CrCl tertiles, all estimated Framingham risks significantly increased as renal function declined (p&lt;0.001 for all trends). When women were divided according to creatinine tertiles, all estimated Framingham risks except for stroke significantly increased as creatinine levels increased. When women were divided according to either eGFR or CrCl tertiles, all estimated Framingham risks significantly increased as renal function declined.
The patients consisted of 946 females (average, 36.6 years old), and 319 males (average, 34.3 years old). In all TMD patients, 945 had symptoms in the unilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and 320 in the bilateral TMJ. There were significant differences in the distribution of disk positions based on age, regardless of gender, in the unilaterally and bilaterally symptomatic groups; however, the results were not significant in the asymptomatic group. There were significant differences with respect to the distribution of disk positions between males and females in asymptomatic group and in the unilaterally symptomatic group, although the bilaterally symptomatic group did not show significant differences in this regard. As regards the disk positions in the joints of the three groups (asymptomatic group, unilaterally and bilaterally symptomatic groups), there were significant interactive effects of disk positions, regardless of gender. There were statistically significant age-related differences in disk deformities in all symptom groups, regardless of gender, except for in the group of males lacking symptoms in either joint. As regards disk deformities among the three groups studies here, there were significant interactive effects for disk positions, regardless of gender.
Eleven patients were excluded from the final analysis because of catheter disconnection or malfunction. Thus 100 patients (50 in each group) were analyzed for POC. Treatment failed to influence patients overall satisfaction but significantly improved early POC. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that late POC were significantly improved in tibial osteotomy as compared to total knee arthroplasty patients. No complication occurred during the study period.
Thirty-four patients with confirmed CTEPH were identified, of these 19 had D-dimer levels and 7 were positive. Of the 234 patients in WHO group 1 excluding patients with portopulmonary hypertension (n = 54) and pulmonary venoocclusive disease (n = 2) 97 had D-dimer levels and 52 were positive. We found an estimated sensitivity of the D-dimer test in diagnosing CTEPH was 37% while the estimated specificity was 46%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 12% and 79% respectively.
The major fatty acids in the retina were palmitic (PA), oleic (OA), stearic (SA), arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. The content of all these fatty acids increased significantly in the diabetic retina, reflecting lipidosis. The major increases (approximately 3 times the normal) were found in PA, OA, SA and AA. The increase in DHA, however, was much less (approximately 1.4 times). The relative percentages of fatty acids were also affected. While the relative percentages of PA and OA increased in the diabetic retina, there were insignificant changes in the percentages of SA and AA. Interestingly, the relative percentage of DHA underwent a significant decrease, about 50% of the normal.
Activated microglia significantly upregulated TNF-alpha and iNOS mRNA expression and protein production in vitro. An optic nerve crush also increased expression of retinal iNOS and TNF-alpha protein. Treatment with alpha-crystallin in vitro and in vivo downregulated their expression.
Retinal neurons survive for 12-14 days in DMEM containing lens extract. However, the cells only survive for 6 days in DMEM and only 7 days in DMEM containing MCM-L or MCM-D. The present results indicate that lens extract may directly promote survival of rat retinal neurons and neurite outgrowth in vitro. The MCM also promoted cell survival and neurite outgrowth but its effects were weaker than that of the lens extract. We postulate that lens extract exerts its effect by direct neurotrophic effects and/or indirectly by activating macrophages in vitro.
Octreotide treatment significantly inhibited fluorescein leakage and the extent of neovascularization as was observed in the flat mounts of choroidal tissue derived from the rats with induced CNV. The VEGF and IGF-1 mRNA levels were reduced following treatment with octreotide.
We found that 13.6% (6/44) of the strains were quinolone resistant. In endophthalmitis, 21.4% were gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and balofloxacin resistant. In corneal ulcers, 14.2, 14.2 and 28.5% were gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and balofloxacin resistant, respectively, and in conjunctivitis only 4.3% were gatifloxacin resistant. The 6 strains with quinolone resistance showed mutations at Ser84Phe for the gyrA gene, and Ser80Phe for the parC gene. Gatifloxacin did not change the expression levels of gyrA and parC genes.
The photoreceptor inner segments in the retina, which was perfused by saline for 1 and 5 min prior to fixation, showed no glutamate IR. However, those in the retina which was perfused by saline for 10 min showed moderate glutamate IR as found in the retina fixed by immersion. The glutamate IR in the inner segments decreased with a saline perfusion of more than 10 min.
We found that the levels of C3a-desArg were significantly elevated in patients with exudative AMD compared to the control group. The concentrations of C3a-desArg in patients with dry AMD were similar to those of controls. Additionally, patients and controls with documented atherosclerosis (AS) displayed significantly higher levels of C3a-desArg compared to subjects without AS.
The new technique provides quality wide-angle digital images of the retina (60 degrees ) in patients with dilated pupils, at a fraction of the cost of established digital fundus photography.
Different truncated fly-rhodopsin Rh1 variants were expressed in the eyes of Drosophila and their localization was analyzed in vivo or by immunofluorescence. A mutant lacking the last 23 amino acids was found to properly localize in the rhabdomeres, the light-sensing organelle of the photoreceptor cells. This constitutes a major difference to trafficking in vertebrates, which involves a conserved QVxPA motif at the very C-terminus. Further truncations of Rh1 indicated that proper localization requires the last amino acid residues of a region called helix 8 following directly the last transmembrane domain. Interestingly, the very C-terminus of invertebrate visual rhodopsins is extremely variable but helix 8 shows conserved amino acid residues that are not conserved in vertebrate homologs.
This study investigated the sensitivity of face processing in AD, young controls and older non-neurological controls to two changes of the stimuli -- a rotation in depth and an inversion. The control groups showed a systematic effect of depth rotation, with errors increasing with the angle of rotation, and with inversion. The majority of the AD group was not impaired when faces were presented upright and no transformation in depth was required, and were most accurate when all faces were presented in frontal views, but accuracy was severely impaired with any rotation or inversion.
To address the in vivo functions of Drosophila RecQ4 (dRecQ4), we generated mutant alleles of dRecQ4 using the targeted gene knock-out technique. Our data show that dRecQ4 mutants are homozygous lethal with defects in DNA replication, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Two sets of experiments suggest that dRecQ4 also plays a role in DNA double strand break repair. First, mutant animals exhibit sensitivity to gamma irradiation. Second, the efficiency of DsRed reconstitution via single strand annealing repair is significantly reduced in the dRecQ4 mutant animals. Rescue experiments further show that both the N-terminal domain and the helicase domain are essential to dRecQ4 function in vivo. The N-terminal domain is sufficient for the DNA repair function of dRecQ4.
In pursuit of such insights, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells expressing an activated form of LRP6 and a beta-catenin-responsive reporter. This screen resulted in the identification of Bili, a Band4.1-domain containing protein, as a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We found that the expression of Bili in Drosophila embryos and larval imaginal discs significantly overlaps with the expression of Wingless (Wg), the Drosophila Wnt ortholog, which is consistent with a potential function for Bili in the Wg pathway. We then tested the functions of Bili in both invertebrate and vertebrate animal model systems. Loss-of-function studies in Drosophila and zebrafish embryos, as well as human cultured cells, demonstrate that Bili is an evolutionarily conserved antagonist of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, we found that Bili exerts its antagonistic effects by inhibiting the recruitment of AXIN to LRP6 required during pathway activation.
In the absence of TGF-beta, Bim was upregulated, cell growth was inhibited and apoptosis was induced. TGF-beta treatment did not affect RUNX3 expression; however, the increase in Bim expression was significant and time dependent. Interestingly, Smad4 but not Smad2/3 was also upregulated upon exposure to TGF-beta. This was not the case after TGF-beta treatment of parent HT-29 cells. As expected, TGF-beta further inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in HT-29/RUNX3+ cells.
Early induction of muscular mRNA expression for CCL5/CCR5 and CXCL9/CXCR3, as well as for iNOS, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and MIF, was demonstrated accompanied by progressive increases in parasitism and leukocyte recruitment. Protein overexpression for MIF and CCL5/CCR5 was also verified in the infected muscles.
The level of ING4 was markedly reduced in glioma tissues, and the extent of reduction correlated with the progression from lower to higher grades of tumors. It was observed that U87MG with exogenous ING4 gene presented with growth suppression, apoptosis enhancement and the deregulation of cell cycle- or apoptosis-regulating proteins.
As for PC, DPD and TS concentrations were significantly higher in cancerous than in noncancerous tissues (p = 0.016 vs. 0.036). In BTC, TS concentration was higher in cancerous than in noncancerous tissue (p = 0.0001). Patients with low TS and DPD concentrations had a tendency to have a better disease-free survival than those with high TS and DPD concentrations in PC groups; especially, BTC patients' disease-free survival with high TS was significantly longer than that with low TS (p = 0.0083).
THP considerably inhibited apoptosis and improved all parameters illustrating membrane and subcellular integrity and functionality. Parallel studies with lauryl-THP failed to show a similar protective effect. Lauryl-THP, in contrast to THP, also failed to decrease tissue ceramide content, indicating the involvement of this well-known mediator of cellular stress response.
Six children (3 boys, 3 girls) with acute EDH were successfully managed at our department without surgical intervention. The Glasgow Outcome Scale score of all patients was 5, with no posttraumatic sequelae. Follow-up brain CT showed complete resolution of the EDH within 2-3 months.
Thirty-seven (63%) patients underwent ETV within (mean) 1.5 days of admission, and of those, 32 (87.1%) exhibited significant improvement in presenting symptomology immediately after ETV. Complications arising after ETV included CSF infection/meningitis (n = 2) and bleeding (n = 1). ETV failed in 5/37 patients over the follow-up period. There was a significant association between increasing severity of hydrocephalus before ETV and increased number of complications (p = 0.03).
The mean NGF level (0.27 +/- 0.48 ng/ml) on the 3rd (NGF3) postoperative day was observed to be higher than the preoperative mean NGF level (NGF0; 0.15 +/- 0.16 ng/ml; p &lt; 0.05). The mean NGF level on postoperative day 30 (NGF30; 0.13 +/- 0.13 ng/ml) was lower than the mean NGF3 level (p &lt; 0.05). While the mean PI value on postoperative day 30 (PI30; 1.06 +/- 0.068) was observed to decrease compared to the preoperative PI (PI0; 1.26 +/- 0.83) and the PI on postoperative day 3 (PI3; 1.09 +/- 0.063), the mean PI3 value exhibited a drop compared to the PI0 value (p &lt; 0.05). Whereas the mean RI value on postoperative day 30 (RI30; 0.63 +/- 0.023) showed a decrease compared to both preoperative mean RI (RI0; 0.70 +/- 0.025) and RI on postoperative day 3 (RI3; 0.65 +/- 0.021), RI3 displayed a drop compared to RI0 (p &lt; 0.05).
All fetuses with MM in group 1 presented neurological deficits and glial reactions with GFAP expression, as opposed to controls and shams. In group 2, corticosteroid treatment prevented some neurological deficits (18-25%), reducing glial response and GFAP expression.
Medicine use for headache was common in all age groups and more females than males used medicine in all three age groups: 34.9% vs. 18.0% at age 15, 45.4% vs. 22.1% at age 19 and 44.3% vs. 29.5% at age 27. The risk of using medicine for headache at age 27 increased if medicine was used at age 15 or 19. However, use increased substantially if medicine for headache was used at both age 15 and 19 (OR = 5.83, 95%CI: 1.99-17.14 for males and OR = 4.67, 95%CI: 2.59-8.43 for females).
There was no consistent change in rate after 2003, with some countries experiencing more and some fewer suicides than expected. Amongst 15-19 year olds the rate ratio was 0.999 (95%CI: 0.971-1.028), and in 10-14 year olds was 0.999 (95%CI: 0.929-1.074). There was some evidence of differential results for males and females. In 15-19 year olds there were 1.8% fewer (95%CI: -5.0 to +1.5%) suicides than expected amongst males and 8.1% more (95%CI: +1.9 to +14.6%) suicides than expected amongst females during 2004-2006. Rate ratios for 10-14 year-olds demonstrated a similar pattern, but with much greater uncertainty.
Use of PPIs exclusively was modestly associated with an increased risk of CRC, however this finding was consistent with chance and based on a small number of patients exposed (OR = 1.7; 95%CI = 0.8, 4.0). H2 blocker use alone was not related to CRC risk (OR = 0.8; 95%CI = 0.6, 1.1).
All five medications exhibited space-time clustering within the first 90 days following the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The Medicaid population surrounding Kalamazoo was more likely to receive a prescription on multiple occasions. Excluding ziprasidone, clusters were not associated with greater geographic access to mental health care professionals.
A total of 2361 questionnaires were suitable in completeness for the statistical analyses. The participants were found to have a good recognition of basic adverse drug reaction (ADR) knowledge, administration knowledge, and drug use rationale, but poor awareness of pharmacovigilance. Significant differences existed in the awareness of pharmacovigilance across regions, hospital classes, and professions. Single-factor analyses showed that region, hospital class, profession, department type, and length of service in the current position, education level, and professional title all significantly affected the degree of awareness. More stringent multi-factor analyses showed that the degree of awareness was highly related to region, hospital class, profession, education level, and professional title.
Nearly 60% of all children ever visited a physician for respiratory symptoms during the first year of life, of which 40% received a prescription. Every extra day with symptoms during the month before consultation and each extra visit to a physician were associated with a higher chance for prescription (respectively odds ratios (OR) 1.07/2.63, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.02-1.12/1.83-3.76). Further, we found a higher chance for drug prescribing for boys (2.7, 2.0-3.7), children attending day care (1.17, 1.09-1.25), mothers with higher education (2.3, 1.2-4.6), working mothers (4.5, 0.9-22.0) and older mothers (years) (1.09, 1.02-1.16). Furthermore, physicians' years of experience was a determinant for receiving a prescription (2.5, 1.1-6.0). Accounting for symptoms and visits as strong predictors of prescribing, infant gender and day care attendance were still predictors. Furthermore, infant gender, day care attendance, family history of asthma and physicians' years of experience were independent determinants of the number of prescriptions besides symptoms and visits.
Of the four ethnicities, Caucasian participants had the highest rate of ADM use (12%) compared with African-American (4%), Asian (2%), and Hispanic (6%) participants. After adjustment, non-Caucasian ethnicity was associated with reduced ADM use: African-American (HR: 0.42; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.31-0.58), Asian (HR: 0.14; 95%CI: 0.08-0.26), and Hispanic (HR: 0.47; 95%CI: 0.31-0.65). Applying IPCW to correct for non-random loss to follow-up among the study participants weakened but did not eliminate these associations: African-American (HR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.30-0.57), Asian (HR: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.13-0.37), and Hispanic (HR: 0.58; 95%CI: 0.47-0.67).
Members expressed concerns that CRTs might compromise their healthcare. Providers and purchasers recognized the value of and the need for comparative effectiveness research. Providers expressed concerns that they would not have sufficient time to discuss a CRT with patients, and that participation in such a study could negatively impact their relationships with patients. Purchasers would want assurances that study participation would not result in members receiving lesser care, and that benefits would remain equitable for all members.
Of the 178 HIV-1 infected children eligible for study, 72.4% had TC &gt; 180 mg/dl, 53.4% had TC &gt; 200 mg/dl. For TC &gt; 200, the multivariable analysis showed increased risk with NRTI/NNRTI (HR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.34-2.19) and NRTI/PI (HR: 3.45, 95%CI: 2.65-4.51) when compared to No MED. Compared to NRTI/NNRTI, NRTI/PI increased the risk for TC &gt; 200 mg/dl (HR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.45-2.39) in the multivariable model.
A total of 705,230 individuals, or 15.3% of the general population, received at least one prescription of a psychotropic drug. The figures for the four therapeutic subgroups were 2.4% for antipsychotics, 6.2% for anxiolytics, 7.9% for hypnotics and 6.0% for antidepressants, respectively. For all subgroups, prevalence was higher among women than among men, and increased steadily by patients' age. The mean annual drug volume per patient was highest among persons aged 40-59 years, except for hypnotics where it continued to increase with age. GPs prescribed 80% of overall psychotropic drug volume, psychiatrists 5%, and other prescribers 15%. The proportion of the drugs issued by the three prescriber groups differed with the patients' age group. While children and adolescents received a relatively large share from paediatricians and child and adolescent psychiatrists, adults mostly got their prescriptions from GPs.
We identified 16 reports (seven from the Pharmacovigilance database and nine from the GERAP database). Local anesthetic allergic reactions occurred mostly in young females (F/M sex ratio = 14:2). An immediate-type allergic reaction was encountered in 11/16 cases. Lidocaine was the local anesthetic most often involved (11/16). Prick test, intradermal reaction, and challenge tests were used to confirm the diagnosis. A cross-reactivity between the different amide type local anesthetics was found in six cases (lidocaine-mepivacaine in all cases).
The index and reference cohort comprised 1471 and 8736 persons, respectively. Both cardiovascular and psychiatric co-morbidities were more prevalent among starters compared to non-starters. 77.7% of the patients stopped using anti-obesity drugs within 90 days. Users of amphetamine-like drugs differed from patients using orlistat or sibutramine, whereas users of orlistat and sibutramine were highly comparable.
A lambda(max) between 290 and 320 nm (OR 3.74, 95% CI 3.45-4.06), and an epsilon &gt; 20,000 M(-1) cm(-1) (OR 5.49, 95% CI 5.10-5.92) were highly associated with the reporting of photosensitivity reactions. Risk of the photosensitivity reactions was significantly increased among intermediate or high AUCs compared to low AUC. Low molecular weight and aromatic halogen atoms were associated with photosensitivity reactions (OR 2.37, 95% CI 2.07-2.71 resp. OR 3.37, 95% CI 3.15-3.61) as were log p &lt; 1 and pKa &lt; 7.
Of 728 patients admitted in medical ICU, 222 (28.4%) had ADRs. Multiple ADRs (38.7%) implicated by the same drug and serious ADRs (37%) were noticed. Renal/electrolyte system (21%) was most commonly involved. Clinical spectrum included acute renal failure (ARF, 11.4%), hepatic injuries (5.4%), haematological dysfunction (4.2%), seizures (3.3%), upper gastrointestinal bleed (3.3%) and cutaneous ADRs (3.3%). Antimicrobials (27%) were the commonly implicated drug class. The most commonly implicated drug was furosemide (6.8%). Infrequently reported ADRs included azithromycin-induced erythema multiforme, leflunamide-induced erythema multiforme and vasculitis, ceftazidime-induced seizures and ceftriaxone-induced hepatitis. Co-morbidity, polypharmacy and duration of stay were significantly higher in patients with ADRs compared to those who have not experienced ADRs. Three patients died.
The IV estimates were uniformly less biased than the conventional estimates, but had higher variance. Accordingly, the bias-variance trade-off favors the IV estimates only when physician' preference is a strong instrument. Still, the coverage rate of the 95%CI for the IV estimates was very close to the nominal 95%, while it was consistently lower for the conventional estimates.
The fluorescence spectra of tumor tissues showed significant differences, both in intensity and in spectral profile, from those of adjacent normal brain tissues at all four excitation wavelengths. The data were then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and the sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each group. Of the four excitation wavelengths being considered, 470 nm appeared to be the optimal wavelength for detecting tissue fluorescence of brain tumor tissues.
Significant increases in the concentrations of glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, and taurine were recorded in the cortices of pilocarpinized rats, and they returned to initial levels after laser treatment. In the hippocampus, a moderate increase in aspartate accompanied by a significant increase in glycine were observed in the epileptic animal model, and these dropped to near-control values after laser treatment. In addition, a significant increase in cortical AST activity and a significant decrease in ALT activity and glucose content were obtained in the pilocarpinized animals and pilocarpinized rats treated with laser irradiation. In the hippocampus, significant decreases in the activity of AST and ALT and glucose content were recorded in the epileptic animals and in the epileptic animals treated with laser irradiation.
The results showed that the rats in group 5 had the highest increase in skin flap viability, with a statistically significant difference compared to the other groups. Statistically significant differences were not seen between any of the other groups.
Least squares linear regression analysis and a one-tailed paired t-test using the matched pairs of pre- and post-treatment data for mean blue pixel intensity showed that a significant lightening effect was achieved by the bleaching treatment. Significant increases in blue pixel intensity (reductions in yellowness) occurred in 78% of the teeth treated.
The dentine surfaces irradiated by the Er,Cr:YSGG laser showed a scaly and rugged appearance and open dentinal tubules without smear layer production. The 5-W-irradiated group had the highest roughness value (p &lt; 0.05). One-way ANOVA revealed that the shear bond strength of resin composites to the laser-irradiated dentine ranged from 12.35-15.61 MPa, and was not significantly (p &gt; 0.05) different from the bond strength seen in the acid-etched dentine of 19.06 MPa. However, the surface roughness of the laser-irradiated dentine was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than that of the acid-etched dentine.
No significant differences were seen between the two groups in relation to wound re-epithelialization, and the group without PRGF actually showed significantly better resolution of the inflammatory process after 14 d (p = 0.036).
For both zirconia-based materials, irradiation with 400 mJ or 600 mJ increased surface roughness and provided significant morphological changes. Air-abraded Cercon surfaces were rougher compared to the ones irradiated with 200 mJ of laser energy, whereas Procera surfaces irradiated with 200 mJ were rougher than the air-abraded ones.
Although there was a difference between blood prolactin levels in the two groups, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.205). However, there was a statistically significant difference in the mean lymphocyte counts and number of vessel lumina, with higher numbers seen in the LLLT group.
ANOVA results showed no significant differences between groups for all VAS scores or in the interaction with the sessions (p &gt; 0.05). The VAS score results showed a statistically significant pain reduction throughout all sessions (p = 0.000).
Laser irradiation promoted extracellular calcification of MSCs, induced the translocation of CRY1 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and decreased CRY1 mRNA levels quantified by real-time PCR. Since the timing of nuclear accumulation of clock proteins constitutes an important step in the transcription-translation feedback loop driving the circadian core oscillator, laser irradiation could provide a simple and effective technology for clock protein localization and turnover. Our results also indicate that CRY1 is a master regulator of circadian rhythm that regulates the extracellular calcification of MSCs.
There was a significant laser-induced reduction and possible modification of the organic matrix content in enamel treated with the low-level diode laser (the L, IVL, and IVFL groups).
In our study, cell survival was reduced by about 50% after 3 h of hematoporphyrin incubation time. In DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, and Diff-Quick assay, necrosis was identified within 12 h and apoptosis soon thereafter. Confocal microscopy revealed that hematoporphyrin was localized in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus as time passed. The quantities of intracellular ROS correlated with the time of hematoporphyrin accumulation. Additionally, Western blot analysis of Bcl-2/Bax, the release of cytochrome C, and activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 showed that apoptosis followed the mitochondria-dependent pathway.
The LF values with and without PVC wrapping were significantly different. For both LF devices, the sensitivity and accuracy were lower when the PVC wrapping was used. The specificity was statistically significantly higher for the LFpen with PVC. No difference was found between the areas under the ROC curves with and without PVC wrapping. The ICC showed excellent interexaminer agreement. The Bland and Altman method showed a range between the upper and the lower limits of agreement of 63.4 and 57.8 units for the LF device, and 49.4 and 74.2 for the LFpen device, with and without PVC wrapping, respectively.
Fifty patients met the inclusion criteria. At the end of treatment there was a decline in pain and a rise in function in both groups compared with baseline (p &lt; 0.0005 on the paired t-test). There were no significant differences in the reduction of pain and the improvement of function between the groups at the end of treatment and at the 3-mo follow-up (p &gt; 0.0005 on the independent t-test).
This work describes some clinical cases that demonstrate the ease of use of this technique to weld broken appliances for both prosthetic and orthodontic therapy.
The results showed that time influenced the cellular viability of L929 cells of both control (p = 0.0014) and illuminated cultures (p = 0.0035). Significant differences between control cells (p = 0.0001) and illuminated Hep.2 cells (p = 0.0001) were observed. There was a significant difference between the proliferation of the two types of cells illuminated compared to their controls: Hep.2 (p = 0.0001) and L929 (p = 0.0002).
The control group showed a statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher calcium concentration compared with all the other groups. The APF group also had a statistically significantly higher calcium concentration (p &lt; 0.05) than did the laser groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference in any of the laser groups whether combined with fluoride or not (p &gt; 0.05). Upon SEM analysis, melted surfaces and crater-like holes 1-20 microm in diameter were found in the CO(2) laser and Nd:YAG laser groups. On PLM, positive birefringence and reversal of birefringence after acid challenge of the lased enamel were seen.
The results following LLLT and LIPUS demonstrate that ultrasound was more effective than laser on fibroblast cell cultures when the endoplasmic reticulum was assessed, whereas there was a better distribution of the filaments of the cytoskeleton in the cells subjected to laser irradiation.
Tests measuring focused and sustained attention yielded an effect size with medium to large magnitude whereas tests of simple attention resulted in a small to medium effect size in terms of poorer attention functioning of ADHD subjects versus controls. On some of the measures (e.g. Stroop interference), a lower level of attention functioning in the ADHD group versus the controls was associated with male gender.
The bipolar group showed slight but significant impairment in performance for the non-verbal tasks (RCPM-A, RCPM-B and LCT), with no significant between-group differences for the two verbal tasks (LF and CF). A group x task x hemisphere analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the TOI revealed an abnormal pattern of prefrontal oxygenation across different types of cognitive processing in the bipolar group. Post hoc analyses following a group x task x hemisphere ANOVA on HbO2 concentration revealed that the bipolar group showed a greater increase in HbO2 concentration in the LCT and in RCPM-B, relative to controls.
There were no significant differences in age and total brain volume (TBV) between the two groups but full-scale IQ was higher in controls. A decrease in brainstem gray-matter volume was observed in the autism group before and after controlling for TBV. No significant differences were observed in white-matter volume. A significant relationship was observed between brainstem gray-matter volume and oral sensory sensitivity as measured by the Sensory Profile Questionnaire (SPQ).
At the bivariate level, the odds of reporting suicidal thoughts were about twice as high in poor than non-poor neighborhoods, and the odds of attempting suicide were about four times higher. After controlling for background vulnerabilities, neighborhood poverty remained significantly associated with both suicidal thoughts and attempts. However, these associations were not explained by late-adolescence psychosocial risks. Rather, youth living in poor neighborhoods may be at greater risk through the amplification of other risk factors in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
ACC showed shorter reaction times and fewer errors than HCC and non-savant subjects with autism, and significantly fewer errors than healthy calendar calculator laymen when calculating dates of the present. Moreover, ACC performed faster and more accurate than HCC regarding past dates. However, no differences between ACC and HCC were detected for future date calculation.
Psychotic disorders and manic episodes of BPAD are most strongly associated with incapacity. In such patients, insight is the best discriminator of capacity status. In patients with non-psychotic disorders, insight is less strongly associated with capacity; in this group depressed mood discriminates capacity status whereas it does not in psychotic disorders. Cognitive performance does not discriminate capacity status in patients with psychotic disorders.
PCS symptoms and PCS symptom severity were associated with self-reported exposure to blast whilst in a combat zone. However, the same symptoms were also associated with other in-theatre exposures such as potential exposure to depleted uranium and aiding the wounded. Strong associations were apparent between having PCS symptoms and other health outcomes, in particular being a post-traumatic stress disorder or General Health Questionnaire case.
Although successful intervention aimed at mental disorders might prevent some proportion of substance dependence, the number of cases of mental disorder that would have to be treated to prevent a single case of substance dependence is estimated to be so high that this would not be a cost-effective way to prevent substance dependence (in the range 76-177 for anxiety-mood disorders and 40-47 for externalizing disorders).
Prescribing ADT to all patients diagnosed with depression would prevent more than one out of three suicide deaths compared to the no-ADT strategy, irrespective of age, gender or parasuicide history. Sensitivity analyses showed that persistence in taking ADT would be the main characteristic influencing the effectiveness of ADT on suicide risk.
Mood lability occurred in more than 5% of the population of children and adolescents, both by parent and self-report. Mood lability was strongly associated with a wide range of psychopathology and was linked to significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric disorders. Mood lability was particularly strongly associated with co-morbidity between internalizing and externalizing disorders, even when adjusting for the association with individual disorders. The pattern of results did not change after excluding youth with bipolar disorder or with episodes of elated mood.
Principal components analyses with a promax rotation yielded three factors reflecting: (1) processing speed/verbal learning, (2) working memory/interference control and (3) abstract problem solving. The CPT working memory measure with interference filtering demands (WM INT) was only administered to subjects aged &gt; or =12 years and was therefore analyzed separately. BPD youth showed impairments versus controls and unaffected relatives on all three factors and on the WM INT. Unaffected relatives exhibited impairments versus controls on the abstract problem-solving factor and the WM INT. They also showed a statistical trend (p=0.07) towards worse performance on the working memory/interference control factor.
Suicide rates (age-adjusted) increased in males from an average of 2.84 (per 100 000) in the period pre-2002 to 8.10 in the period post-2002, and for females from 1.51 to 3.68. The greatest increases in suicide in the post-2002 period were in the age groups 20-29 and 60 years, for both males and females. Tourist arrivals fell significantly after the bombings, and addition of tourism to models reduced relative risk estimates of suicide, suggesting that some of the increase may be attributable to the socio-economic effects of declines in tourism.
Both groups of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder made more EDS and RL errors than controls. Neither measure separated the two disorders, even when the analysis was restricted to euthymic patients. No relationship was found with prescribed medication.
High-IQ adults with ADHD reported a lower quality of life, had poorer familial and occupational functioning, and had more functional impairments, including more speeding tickets, accidents and arrests. Major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses were higher in high-IQ adults with ADHD. All other psychiatric co-morbidities, including antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse, did not differ between the two high-IQ groups. ADHD was more prevalent in first-degree relatives of adults with ADHD relative to controls.
Both P300 and MMN are heritable, with heritability estimates of 0.58 for MMN, 0.68-0.80 for P300 amplitude, and 0.21-0.56 for P300 latency. The bipolar patients and their relatives showed normal MMN. No significant association, either genetic or environmental, was found with BPD. BPD was significantly associated with reduced P300 amplitude and prolonged latency on midline and bilateral temporal-posterior scalp areas. Shared genetic factors were the main source of these associations.
The persistence of depressive symptoms increased significantly in the two younger groups. Earlier ages of onset were associated with higher depressive morbidity throughout the 20 years of follow-up but did not predict changes in symptom persistence. The proportions of weeks spent in episodes of either pole correlated across follow-up periods in all age groupings, although correlations were stronger for depressive symptoms and for shorter intervals.
Transfers of properties between different meanings of 'representation' together with a systematic ambiguity in the use of 'representation' are proposed as the main ways for representational approaches to assure stability to their proposals in spite of the violence exerted on clinical phenomena.
Perplexity, self-disorder, and diminished affectivity significantly predicted psychosis risk. Depressed patients without psychosis risk displayed impaired recognition performance for negative social emotions, whereas patients with psychosis risk were also impaired in the recognition of cognitive expressions. In the high-risk group, self-disorder was associated with impaired recognition of facial expressions.
During the first evaluation, 41.1% (39) of our participants had acute stress disorder (ASD). It was found that lower perceived social support (OR = 0.0908, 95% CI = 0.834-0.989, p = 0.027) and higher peritraumatic dissociative experience scores (OR = 1.332, 95% CI = 1.170-1.516, p &lt; 0.001) were significant predictors of ASD. In the evaluations after 3, 6 and 12 months after the accident, we found PTSD affected 29.8, 23.1 and 17.9% of the participants, respectively. Although limitations at work and in social life after a traffic accident were not related to PTSD at 3 months (OR = 122.43, 95% CI = 0.000, p = 0.999) or at 6 months (OR = 63.438, 95% CI = 0.529-76.059, p = 0.089), limitations at work and in social life were predictors of PTSD at 12 months (OR = 155.514, 95% CI = 2.321-104.22, p = 0.019).
The negative and depressive symptom subscales fit well according to a variety of fit indexes for all groups individually after some modest model modification. However, multisample modeling procedures indicated that the pattern of factor loadings was significantly different among the groups in most cases.
With regard to lifetime prevalence of axis I disorders, men more often displayed a substance use disorder, in particular alcohol dependency (65 vs. 43%); on the other hand, women more frequently had an affective (94 vs. 82%), anxiety (92 vs. 80%) or eating disorder (35 vs. 18%), in particular anorexia nervosa (21 vs. 4%). Regarding the 12-month prevalence, we found significantly more women suffering from anorexia nervosa (13 vs. 0%). Considering the 4-week prevalence, there were no significant gender differences. With regard to axis II disorders, men had a higher frequency of antisocial personality disorder (57 vs. 26%). Regarding the BPD diagnostic criteria, men more often displayed 'intensive anger' (74 vs. 49%), whereas women more frequently showed 'affective instability' (94 vs. 82%).
FTD as self-reported by patients was significantly associated with the synonyms test performance and severity of the reality distortion dimension. FTD as assessed by a clinician and by the patients' carers was significantly associated with executive test performance and performance in a test of associative semantics. Overall insight was significantly associated with severity of the reality distortion dimension and graded naming test performance, but was not associated with self-reported FTD or severity of FTD as assessed by the clinician or carers.
Delirium was correctly detected by CAM algorithm in 10 out of 13 delirious patients resulting in a high sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.96-1.00 for both raters. Likelihood ratio revealed an almost 20-fold risk of delirium with positive CAM testing. Interrater reliability was excellent with a Cohen's k of 0.95 (CI 0.74-1.0) for the algorithm, single items' k values varied between 0.5 and 1.
Heritabilities for adiposity and PA traits, and the genetic, household and environmental correlations among them, were estimated using maximum likelihood variance components methods. Significant genetic effects (P &lt; 0.05) were found for sport (h2 = 0.26) and leisure PA (h2 = 0.17). Significant (P &lt; 0.05) household effects existed for leisure PA (c2 = 0.25). Sport PA had a negative genetic correlation with central adiposity measurements adjusted for height (rhoG &gt; |-0.40|). Sport and leisure PA had negative genetic correlations with %BF (rhoG &gt; |-0.46|).
A total of 13 558 men and 15 521 women were investigated. All five obesity indices were positively correlated with blood pressures and hypertension. After adjusting for age, WSR in men and BMI in women had the greatest association with the presence of hypertension, irrespective of the statistical method used. BMI had the strongest correlation with continuous blood pressures in both genders.
Findings based on the 184 subjects with complete data indicated that the causal relationship between household food insecurity and depression is bidirectional (P = 0.034 for causation from depression to food insecurity, P = 0.003 for causation from food insecurity to depression, chi(2)/df = 1.835, root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.068, comparative fit index = 0.989). Findings based on all 413 subjects after imputation of missing values also indicated bidirectionality.
Greater food variety (OR = 1.32 for women, 1.13 for men), high leisure-time physical activity (OR = 2.20 for women, 1.91 for men), frequent intentions to eat healthy (OR = 8.19 for women, 5.40 for men) and low energy intake (OR=0.78 for women, 0.85 for men) were significantly associated with high diet quality. For women education was positively associated with diet quality. The study did not demonstrate any association between BMI and diet quality.
The mean MNA score was 23.8 (sd 3.92), 36.4 % of elders were at risk of malnutrition and 8.0 % were malnourished; 61.7 % were functionally independent. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated that age, marital status, education level, personal income, number of chronic medical conditions suffered and functional status had significant correlations with nutritional status. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis identified that the best predictors were the number of chronic conditions suffered, age, functional status and marital status.
Between 08.00 and 17.00 hours, when foods were both weighed and recalled, approximately 70 % of weighed food items were recalled the next day. Under-reporting of food amounts was seen across most food categories for the recall, with added sugars, sweets and fats being most affected. The recall underestimated energy intakes by approximately 6-9 % during this period. Correlation coefficients between nutrient intakes ranged from 0.43 to 0.65, while weighted kappa values ranged from 0.22 to 0.50. Higher levels of agreement were noted for nutrient densities, with correlation coefficients between 0.46 and 0.82 and weighted kappa values between 0.30 and 0.73.
Gender, elapsed time and BMI contributed to self-report bias. Effects of gender and elapsed time were small relative to the effects of BMI, with women tending to underestimate weight by 0.82 kg (1.8 lb), men overestimating by 2.27 kg (5.0 lb) and bias increasing by 0.09 kg (0.2 lb) for each year of retrospection. Every increase of one unit in BMI was associated with an additional 0.91 kg (2.0 lb) underestimate in self-reported weight.
Anthropometric measurements were available for 4498 children. Among the 929 stunted children (20.7 %), 495 were boys (53.3 %) and 434 were girls (46.5 %). In multivariate analysis, risk factors were young age (1-2 years: OR = 2.32, 95 % CI 1.67, 3.22; 2-3 years: OR = 1.64, 95 % CI 1.22, 2.21), resident of Al-Akhdar (OR = 1.67, 95 % CI 1.08, 2.58), being a boy (OR = 1.28, 95 % CI 1.05, 1.55), having a less educated father (illiterate: OR = 2.10, 95 % CI 1.17, 3.77; preparatory school: OR = 1.71, 95 % CI 1.11, 2.65), poor psychosocial stimulation (no family visits or trips: OR = 1.52, 95 % CI 1.07, 2.16; father rarely/never plays with child: OR = 2.24, 95 % CI 1.20, 4.16), filtered water (OR = 8.45, 95 % CI 2.31, 30.95), throwing garbage in the street (OR = 13.81, 95 % CI 2.33, 81.72), diarrhoea (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI 1.09, 2.29) and low birth weight (OR = 1.8, 95 % CI 1.17, 2.40). Protective factors were older age of father (OR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.32, 0.90) and water storage (OR = 0.70, 95 % CI 0.54, 0.90). These variables only explained 20 % of cases of stunting.
The mean age of the children evaluated was 5.78 (sd 0.43) years, 6535 (52.1 %) were boys. Physically active children were less likely to be overweight (OR = 0.786, 95 % CI 0.687, 0.898) or obese (OR = 0.655, 95 % CI 0.506, 0.849) and achieved 6.7 (95 % CI 5.8, 7.7) % more jumps per 30 s than less active children in a motor test, adjusted for a number of potentially confounding variables.
Most children (85 %) were classified as having a poor quality diet (low diet quality score). Mothers' general knowledge about healthy eating was high, but did not predict the quality of the children's diet. Lower frequencies of food preparation and serving, such as cooking with raw ingredients, providing breakfast daily and the family eating together, were also associated with a poorer diet. Regression modelling identified five significant factors. An increased risk of a poor diet was associated with mothers being unlikely to restrict sweets (OR = 21.63, 95 % CI 2.70, 173.30) or finding it difficult to provide 2-3 portions of fruit daily (OR = 2.94, 95 % CI 1.09, 7.95). Concern that the child did not eat enough increased the risk of a poor diet (OR = 2.37, 95 % CI 1.09, 5.16). Believing a healthy diet would help the child eat more reduced the risk of having a poor diet (OR = 0.28, 95 % CI 0.11, 0.74), as did providing breakfast daily (OR = 0.22, 95 % CI 0.05, 0.99).
GI showed higher adherence (mean MDS 5.12 (sd 1.42)) to the MDP than BI (mean MDS 3.32 (sd 1.23)). BI diet was characterized by a high intake of legumes, nuts, seed oils, sugar and confectionery, and non-alcoholic beverages compared with GI, whereas GI diet was richer in fruit, vegetables, potatoes, olive oil, animal products and alcoholic beverages.
Pregnant women who had a BMI of &lt;18.5 kg/m(2) on first presentation should have been selected for supplementary feeding (2512 kJ (600 kcal)/d for six days per week) starting at month 4 (16 weeks) of pregnancy. However, of the 526 women who had BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m(2), only 335 received supplementation; so the failure rate was 36.3 %. In addition, of those receiving supplementation, only 193 women (36.7 % of 526 women) commenced supplementation at the correct time, of whom thirty-two (9.6 % of 335 women) received supplementation for the correct number of days (100 % days). There were no significant differences in mean weight gain between BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m(2) supplemented or non-supplemented groups or between the equivalent groups with BMI &gt; or = 18.5 kg/m(2). Weight gain was inversely related to initial weight, so lighter women gained relatively more weight during their pregnancy than heavier women. The mean birth weight in the supplemented and non-supplemented groups was 2.63 kg and 2.72 kg, respectively. Mothers with BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m(2) who were or were not supplemented had almost equal percentages of low-birth-weight babies (21 % and 22 %, respectively).
Over the period, the frequency of fish intake increased and CHD mortality decreased significantly in the population age group of 50-69 years, while in the age group of 40-49 years little change in both fish intake and CHD mortality was observed. It was estimated that 240 CHD deaths (or 29 % of the total) were avoided among the population aged 40-69 years in 2003, as more than half of the population consumed fish every day in Hong Kong.
The limited literature supports a greater integration and application of capacity-building strategies and principles in public health nutrition practice, and that this application should be overt and strategic. A framework is proposed that identifies a number of determinants of capacity for effective public health nutrition action. The framework represents the key foundations for building capacity including leadership, resourcing and intelligence. Five key strategic domains supported by these foundation elements, including partnerships, organisational development, project management quality, workforce development and community development, are proposed. This framework can be used to assist the systematic assessment, development and evaluation of capacity-building activity within public health nutrition practice.
Both child and parent reports indicated that the intervention group had a significantly higher fruit intake at 2-year follow-up (difference, servings/d: 0.15; 95 % CI 0.004, 0.286 for child reports; 0.19; 95 % CI 0.030, 0.340 for parent reports). No significant effects on vegetable intake were observed. Significant positive intervention effects were also found for knowledge of fruit recommendations among boys. Some evidence was found for partial mediation analyses of the effects on fruit intake.
Average Zn intake was 5.8, 4.8 and 5.3 mg/d for 1969, 1978 and 1988 respectively, increasing to 7.3 mg/d in 1998 (73 % of the Korean Dietary Reference Intake). The phytate:Zn molar ratio decreased from 21 to 8 during the study period. Dietary Zn depletion due to marked decreases in cereal consumption, particularly barley which has a low Zn bioavailability, was counterbalanced by marked increases in the consumption of meat and fish, which are also Zn-rich foods. Reduced phytate consumption coincident with increased Zn intake suggests that Zn bioavailability also improved, particularly by 1998.
Total 30 d fish frequency consumption was negatively associated with CRP (b = -0.10, 95 % CI -0.19, -0.02, P = 0.015) and positively associated with HDL-C (b = 1.40, 95 % CI 0.31, 2.50, P = 0.014). Adjustment for other risk factors did not significantly attenuate the associations. Despite the collinearity between fish and Hg, there is a protective association between fish intake and CHD risk factors.
The prevalence of T2DM and IHG was 2.6 % and 1.9 % respectively. ROC curve analyses indicated 0.5 as the optimal cut-off value for WHtR in both sexes. High BMI, WC and WHtR were all associated with the prevalence of glucose tolerance abnormalities, with the highest prevalence ratio (PR) for high WHtR (men: PR = 2.85, 95 % CI 2.54, 3.21; women: PR = 3.10, 95 % CI 2.74, 3.51). When combining BMI and WHtR, in men either a high BMI or a high WHtR alone was associated with increased risk. Among women, a high BMI without a concomitant high WHtR was not associated with increased glucose tolerance abnormalities risk, whereas a high WHtR was associated with risk irrespective of BMI.
Average amounts of trans fatty acids (TFA) and MUFA decreased, while average amounts of PUFA increased significantly from 2002 to 2006. The proportion of margarines with less than 0.2 g TFA/10 g serving rose significantly from 31 % in 2002 to 69 % in 2006. Margarines lower in TFA on average cost significantly more than margarines with greater amounts of these fats, and this relationship appeared stronger in 2006 relative to 2002.
The prevalence of overweight in participants from Samos and Corfu was 10.7 % and 6.5 % respectively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. In Corfu, the diet comprised 52 % carbohydrate, 34 % fat and 14 % protein, all different from the composition of the Samian diet (42 % carbohydrate, 39 % fat, 19 % protein; P &lt; or = 0.05). Inadequacies in micronutrient intake were evident only in the diet of Samos and concerned folate and P of the pre-schoolers and biotin of the school-aged participants. The diet in Corfu was more similar to the overall Mediterranean pattern as well as that of Italian children. Growth and overweight trends in Corfu resembled the ones in Italy, whereas in Samos, similarities were identified with trends from Turkey.
About 31 % of the women regularly consumed cereal. After adjusting for energy intake, race/ethnicity, marital status, breakfast consumption and supplement use, cereal eaters had significantly higher intakes of folate, Fe, Zn, Ca, fibre and vitamins A, C, D and E (all P &lt; 0.01) and were approximately two to six times more likely to have intakes in the highest third of the distribution for folate, Fe, Zn, Ca, vitamins A and D, and fibre (all P &lt; 0.01) than cereal non-eaters. Cereal consumption was also associated with reductions of 65-90 % in the risk of nutrient inadequacies compared with non-consumption (all P &lt; 0.01).
The three sets of growth curves provided conflicting pictures of the relative growth of girls and boys by age and over time. Conclusions on sex differences in growth depended also on the method used to analyse the curves, be it according to the shape or the relative position of the sex-specific curves. The shapes of the WHO-generated curves uniquely implied that Bangladeshi girls faltered faster or caught up slower than boys throughout their pre-school years, a finding consistent with the literature. In contrast, analysis of the relative position of the curves suggested that girls had higher WHO Z-scores than boys below 24 months of age.
Total monetary diet cost showed a significant positive association with biomarker-based estimates of protein, K and Na. Vegetables and fish were not only the main contributors to total monetary diet cost (16.4 % and 15.5 %, respectively) but also were relatively strongly correlated with total monetary diet cost (Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.70 and 0.68, respectively). Monetary cost of vegetables was significantly positively associated with all three nutrients, while that of fish showed a significant and positive association only with protein.
After adjustment for potential confounding factors, monetary cost of dietary energy was significantly and negatively associated with BMI (P for trend = 0.0024). Monetary cost of dietary energy also showed a significant and negative association with waist circumference independently of potential confounding factors, including BMI (P for trend = 0.0003). No significant associations were observed for other metabolic risk factors examined (P for trend = 0.10-0.88).
Thirty-three per cent of Aboriginal households were food insecure as compared with 9 % of non-Aboriginal households (univariate OR 5.2, 95 % CI 4.2, 6.3). Whereas 14 % of Aboriginal households had severe food insecurity, 3 % of non-Aboriginal households did. The prevalence of sociodemographic risk factors for household food insecurity was higher for Aboriginal households. Aboriginal households were more likely to have three or more children (14 % v. 5 %), be lone-parent households (2 1 % v. 5 %), not have home ownership (52 % v. 31 %), have educational attainment of secondary school or less (43 % v. 26 %), have income from sources other than wages or salaries (38 % v. 29 %), and be in the lowest income adequacy category (33 % v. 12 %). Adjusted for these sociodemographic factors, Aboriginal households retained a higher risk for food insecurity than non-Aboriginal households (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 2.1, 3.2).
Almost 38 % of mothers underestimated their child's weight status. The frequency of underestimation was much higher among 'at risk of being overweight' and 'overweight' children (88.3 % and 54.5 %, respectively) compared with 'underweight/normal-weight' children (18.0 %, P &lt; 0.001). Multiple logistic regression modelling revealed that the likelihood of mothers' underestimation of their child's weight status was significantly higher in boys, in children engaging in physical activity for less than 3 h/week and in children whose mothers had low education status, compared with their counterparts. Moreover, the higher the BMI-for-age Z-score, the greater the odds that the mother would underestimate her child's weight status.
Local offices of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority were over-represented among respondents. Functions related to communication and food and nutrition laws and regulations were most frequently rated as important by the respondents. Functions in nutrition research, project work and policy and planning were also regarded important by more than half of the respondents. The priorities of the potential employers together with the additional comments and suggestions were taken into account when a new curriculum on public health nutrition was developed.
Children reported lower availability and accessibility of fruits at home than did their parents, while the reports of children and parents for vegetables were more in agreement. A larger proportion of the observed variance in children's fruit and vegetable intake could be explained by the child's perception than by the parent's perception of determinants. The strongest determinants for fruit and vegetable intake according to the children's reports were availability at home, modelling, demanding family rule and knowledge of recommendations. The strongest modelling determinant for fruit was the father's fruit intake while for vegetables it was eating vegetables together with the family.
The overall prevalence of overweight, obesity and high WC was approximately 15 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. Prevalence estimated using internal Z-scores was similar to that using the International Obesity Taskforce cut-off points. Obesity (8.0 % in females, 3.3 % in males) and high WC (16.2 % in females, 1.7 % in males) were significantly more prevalent in females when using internal Z-score cut-offs. High WC was associated with the absence of fruit consumption (P = 0.043) and overweight with high sweetened beverage consumption (P = 0.018).
Weight status of the children was associated with weight status, education and employment status of the parents. Meal patterns were strongly dependent on children's age and parental employment. As age increased, the frequency of meal consumption, participation rate in school lunches and the number of family meals decreased. Using linear regression analysis, a high inverse association between BMI-SDS and meal frequency was observed, in addition to relationships with parental weight status and paternal education.
Adjusted LOS was similar among normal (4.99 d), overweight (5.00 d), obese (5.02 d) and morbidly obese (5.17 d) patients (P = 0.20). Adjusted overall episode costs were no different (P = 0.23) between the groups of normal ($17,211), overweight ($17,462), obese ($17,195) and morbidly obese ($17,655) patients. Overall operative and anaesthesia costs were higher in the morbidly obese group ($5688) than in normal ($5553), overweight ($5549) and obese ($5593) patients (P = 0.03). Operating room costs were higher in morbidly obese patients ($3418) than in normal ($3276), overweight ($3291) and obese ($3340) patients (P &lt; 0.001). Post-operative costs were no different (P = 0.30). Blood bank costs differed (P = 0.002) and were lower in the morbidly obese group ($180) compared with the other patient groups (P &lt; 0.05). Other differences in costs were not significant. Morbidly obese patients were more likely to be transferred to a nursing home (24.1 %) than normal (18.4 %), overweight (17.9 %) or obese (16.0 %) patients (P = 0.001 each). There were no differences in the composite endpoint of 30 d mortality, re-admissions, re-operations or intensive care unit utilization.
When all patients were grouped together, the MAR images showed mild to moderate improvement over the FBP images. However, when the cases were divided by implant size, the MAR images consistently received higher image quality scores than the FBP images for large metal implants (total hip prostheses). For small metal implants (screws, plates, staples), conversely, the MAR images received lower image quality scores than the FBP images due to blurring artifact. The difference of image scores for the large and small implants was significant (p = 0.002). Interobserver agreement was found to be high for all measures of image quality (k &gt; 0.9).
Of the 28 patients (20 males, eight females, age 13-66 years, mean 28 years) who were found to have medial patellar ossification, 22 had radiographs, 16 had magnetic resonance imaging, and ten had both. The medial patellar ossification ranged in size from 2 to 18 mm with an average of 6.8 mm. Twelve were located in the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), 14 in the medial joint capsule, and two in both the MPFL and joint capsule. Twenty-seven of 28 patients had a single ossification, and one patient had two ossifications. The timing from injury to first imaging of the lesion ranged from 10 days to a chronic history (&gt; or = 35 years) of patellar instability.
The chondromas ranged in size from 1.6 to 3.8 cm (mean 2.3 cm). Two lesions were located in the proximal femoral diaphysis, two in the distal femoral diaphysis, six in the distal femoral metaphysis, and one in the proximal tibial epimetaphysis. The lesions were curetted due to diagnostic uncertainty, continued pain, marked radiologic cortical penetration, or due to patient insistence on biopsy. All 11 lesions were benign, nine histologically, and two by stability over 4 and 7 years. The prevalence of cortical scalloping among eccentric chondromas was 100%. Cortical scalloping or occupancy ranged from 50 to 100% (mean 75%).
The outstanding clinical features were short stature, midface hypoplasia, and multiple dislocations and/or ligamentous laxity of the large joints, particularly at the knees with a genu valgum or varum deformity. Of seven patients, six patients showed normal intellect but one patient had mild mental retardation. The main radiological features included small, irregular epiphyses, metaphyseal irregularity with vertical striations that was a constant finding at the knees, constricted femoral necks, delayed ossification of the carpal bones, and slender metacarpals. Progressive thoracolumbar scoliosis was evident with aging; however, the vertebral bodies appeared normal in height or mild platyspondyly was noted.
At 7.0 T, SNR was increased (p &lt; 0.05) for all sequences. For the IM-w FSE sequence, limitations with the specific absorption rate (SAR) required modifications of the scan parameters yielding an incomplete coverage of the knee joint, extensive artifacts, and a less effective fat saturation. CNR and image quality were increased (p &lt; 0.05) for SPGR and FIESTA and decreased for IM-w FSE. Diagnostic confidence for cartilage lesions was highest (p &lt; 0.05) for FIESTA at 7.0 T. Evaluation of BMEP was decreased (p &lt; 0.05) at 7.0 T due to limited performance of IM-w FSE.
The overall MOCART score in patients after MACT was 73.8. T2 relaxation times (approximately 50 ms), T2* relaxation times (approximately 16 ms), and the diffusion constant for DWI (approximately 1.3) were comparable for the healthy volunteers and the control cartilage in the patients after MACT. The cartilage repair tissue showed no significant difference in T2 and T2* relaxation times (p &gt; or = 0.05) compared to the control cartilage; however, a significantly higher diffusivity (approximately 1.5; p &lt; 0.05) was noted in the cartilage repair tissue.
Each radiologist scored the 3.0 T studies higher than those obtained at 1.5 T in visualizing anatomical structures and abnormalities (p &lt; 0.05). Using arthroscopy as a standard of reference, diagnosis of cartilage abnormalities was improved at 3.0 T with higher sensitivity (75.7% versus 70.6%), accuracy (88.2% versus 86.4%), and correct grading of cartilage lesions (51.3% versus 42.9%). Diagnostic confidence scores were higher at 3.0 than 1.5 T (p &lt; 0.05) and signal-to-noise ratio at 3.0 T was approximately twofold higher than at 1.5 T.
Vibration of the penis caused immediate cutaneous vasoconstriction, but negligible sweat release, in the hands and feet of the quadriplegics and the feet of the paraplegics. Systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by up to 90 mm Hg, and a compensatory vagal bradycardia was observed in five of the six quadriplegics and two of the four paraplegic subjects.
One-channel cystometry permits to accurately evaluate bladder pressure development at constant filling speed. It shows detrusor muscle behaviour as detrusor overactivity and allows evaluating sensation of bladder filling. It can strongly suggest detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia. The need of bladder-relaxant drugs and their effectiveness can be evaluated. The major limitation is that the one pressure line will show changes of intravesical pressure independent of their cause, which makes a continuous thorough observation mandatory throughout the test. Other limitations are a filling rate higher than physiological and a filling solution at room temperature. As in more elaborate urodynamic testing, the observations do therefore not necessarily reflect the function of the lower urinary tract in daily life.
Four patients with I-TM (31%) had a relapsing course . They were all males with age &gt;50, and severe at-onset disability. The final outcome was poor in three out of four patients. Serum NMO-immunoglobulin G was undetectable in all patients. Longitudinally extensive myelitis was not predictive of relapses. I-TM and P-TM shared clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI features, as well as a similar rate (54 vs 38%) of peripheral nervous system involvement (polyradiculoneuritis), and an identical rate of relapses (31% for both forms).
Women tended to spend more time participating in domestic and personal care ADL than men. Compared to individuals with tetraplegia, individuals with paraplegia tended to spend more time transferring, cleaning and preparing food and less time wheeling, toileting and dressing. Fitness and participation in leisure time physical activity (LTPA) were associated with certain ADL. Participants with higher levels of fitness spent more time partaking in ADL wheeling and cleaning. Moreover, greater time spent participating in moderate- and heavy-intensity LTPA was positively correlated with time spent engaged in certain ADL.
Specimens (12/15) from patients with spinal cord lesions and specimens (8/11) without spinal cord lesions demonstrated staining for P(2)X(2) receptors in the detrusor muscle and the urothelium. There was a tendency towards a stronger staining in specimens from patients with spinal cord lesion.
Studied population consisted of 161 acute phase AIS grade A patients; 37 grade B; 43 grade C and 32 acute phase AIS grade D patients. Forty-two patients (26%) converted from AIS grade A, 27 (73%) from grade B, 32 (75%) from grade C and five patients (16%) from AIS grade D. The frequencies of AIS conversions and functional ambulation recovery outcomes were significantly different (P&lt;0.001) in patients with motor complete SCI. The ratio of patients with both recovery of ambulatory function and AIS conversion (n=101) differed significantly (P&lt;0.001) between the acute phase AIS grade scores; AIS grade A (6/40 patients, 15%), B (9/27 patients, 33%), C (23/29 patients, 79%) and D (5/5 patients 100%).
Successful outcome was achieved in 98 (46%) patients after a mean follow-up of 19 months (range 1-114 months). A Kaplan-Meier plot showed a dropout of 20% in the first 3 months. After 3 years, the rate of success was 35% and remained almost unchanged afterwards. A regression analysis showed male gender (odds ratio (OR) 2.1), mixed symptoms (OR 2.9) and prolonged colorectal transit time (OR 2.4) to be significantly associated with successful outcome. One non-lethal bowel perforation occurred in approximately 50,000 irrigations (0.002%), whereas minor side effects were observed in 48%.
Thirteen participants underwent 19 insertions of study catheters. Eight participants (62%) became successfully colonized for &gt;3 days after catheter removal. In these 8 participants, the rate of UTI during colonization was 0.77 per patient-year, in comparison with the rate of 2.27 UTI per patient-year before enrollment.
The biomarkers S-100beta, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament light chain, and Glial fibrillary acidic protein are significantly increased in cases of (experimental) spinal cord injury. Furthermore, increased serum concentrations of S-100beta have been correlated with an unfavourable functional outcome. Although biomarkers in SCI show promising results, considerations and shortcomings, such as polytrauma, haemolysis, extracerebral sources, and poor resuscitation, must be studied in greater detail before biomarkers can be utilised in the clinical care of SCI.
No studies conclusively showed an effective intervention. However, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and those that exist assess interventions and outcome measures that could be improved. Five studies on weight-bearing early post-injury are conflicting, but standing or walking may help retain bone mineral. In the chronic phase, there was no effect of weight bearing (12 studies). One study found that an early commencement of sports after SCI improved bone mineral, and the longer the period of athletic career, the higher the (leg) bone mineral. Early after SCI, there may be some effects of electrical stimulation (ES) (five studies). Chronic-phase ES studies vary (14 studies, including mixed periods after injury), but improvement is seen with longer period of training, or higher frequency or stimulus intensity. Improvements correspond to trabecular bone in the distal femur or proximal tibia. Impact vibration and pulsed electromagnetic fields may have some positive effects, whereas pulsed ultrasound does not. Six studies on the influence of spasticity show inconsistent results.
The 123 typhoid cases (median age: 25 years, 47% female) and 123 controls did not differ with respect to baseline characteristics. Cases were less likely to store drinking water in narrow-mouthed containers (MOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.7, AFP 29%), tip containers to draw water (MOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.7, AFP 33%) and have home latrines (MOR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, AFP 23%). Cases were more likely to consume butter (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3-4.1, AFP 28%), yoghurt (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4-3.7, AFP 34%) and raw fruits and vegetables, including onions (MOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.9, AFP 34%), cabbages (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7-4.8, AFP 44%) and unwashed guavas (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3, AFP 25%).
The overall prevalence of malaria parasitaemia during pregnancy was 47%. Older age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.54-0.78], multigravidity (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.42-0.61) and third trimester of pregnancy (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99) were associated with a decreased risk of parasitaemia. Enrollment during the rainy or post-rainy season was associated with an increased risk of parasitaemia (AOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.20-3.04 and AOR 3.12, 95% CI, 2.60-3.74 respectively). Malaria infection was associated with an increased risk of anaemia among young women. The prevalences of anaemia (Hb&lt;11.0 g/dl) and severe anaemia (Hb&lt;7.0 g/dl) during pregnancy were 72% and 2% respectively. The risk of anaemia was lower in older women (AOR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.64-0.97), multigravidae (AOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.83) and in educated women (AOR 0.81, 0.68-0.98).
83% of households in communities with high VL attack rates belonged to the two lowest quintiles of the Bihar wealth distribution. All socio-economic indicators showed significantly lower wealth for those households.
The review assesses the appropriateness of the existing typologies from a programmatic perspective and identifies their strengths and limitations. It indicates there is conceptual confusion around the typology and that none of the existing typologies are exhaustive, in that none includes all types of sex work documented in India. The typology developed by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is the most comprehensive. The typology is based on the primary place of solicitation and categorizes female sex workers (FSWs) as brothel-based, street-based, home-based, lodge-based, dhaba-based and highway-based FSWs. However, this typology has its limitations. First, it does not include all categories of FSWs documented in the literature, such as indirect-primary (primarily solicit clients at their places of work, which are venues where facilitating sex work is their main purpose e.g. massage parlours, bars), indirect-secondary (primarily solicit clients at their places of work, which are in non-sex work related industries e.g. agriculture, construction) and phone-based FSWs (primarily solicit clients through phones). Second, the methodology used to develop the typology proposed by NACO or by any other researchers is not explicit. In addition, the extent to which the typology captures the HIV risk variability between FSWs types is not explored.
Three turning points occurred around early August, late August/early September, and late October/early November. The 'initial' reproduction number for the first wave was R(i) = 4.67 (95% CI: 0*-10.92), where 0* = max{0, lower bound}, and R(i) = 3.93 (95% CI: 1.74-6.13) for the second wave. The highest correlation was between dengue incidence and two climatological variables: maximum temperature at a lag of 5 weeks (r = 0.66 and 0.71) and total precipitation at a lag of seven weeks (r = 0.53). Conclusions The first two turning points were partially attributable to two typhoons around early to mid-August that brought a sharp drop in temperature and substantial rainfall. The drop in temperature first drove the dengue incidence down, then the rainfall drove it up at the beginning of fall. In recent years, Taiwan has witnessed increasingly frequent large summer dengue outbreaks that persisted into early winter, perhaps due to warmer autumns. This highlights the possible impact of global warming on the spread of infectious diseases.
Belén indicators were consistently less favourable than country-level indicators, and indicators even differed between zones of high and low socioeconomic status within Belén itself.
Of the 898 participants, 411 [45.7%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 42.4-49.0%] had any laboratory diagnosed vaginal infection. BV was detected in 165 women (19.1%, 95%CI: 16.5-21.9%) using Nugent score. TV was detected in 76 women (8.5%, 95%CI: 6.7-10.4%) using culture. Among the entire study population, POC correctly detected 82% of laboratory diagnosed BV cases, and 83% of laboratory diagnosed TV infections. Among women with complaints of vulval itching, burning, abnormal vaginal discharge, and/or sores (445/898), POC correctly detected 83% (60 of 72 cases) of laboratory diagnosed BV cases vs. 40% (29 of 72 cases) correctly managed using the syndromic approach (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, POC would have detected 82% (37 of 45 cases) of TV cases vs. 51% (23 of 45 cases) correctly managed using the syndromic approach (P = 0.001).
Wealth index emerged a risk factor for infection with S. mansoni after controlling for water contact and treatment with praziquantel. The adjusted odds ratio of being infected for the lowest level of wealth index compared to the highest was 10.42 (95% CI 3.38-32.36 P &lt; 0.001). The intensity of infection decreased with wealth index Linearity F-ratio 13.91, 1 df, P &lt; 0.001). The geometric egg count for those in the lowest wealth index was 230 (95% CI 199-279) compared to 114 (95% CI 80-162) for the highest wealth index.
The results support our hypothesis that child mortality trends have a spatial component that can be attributed to broad-scale environmental and social-economic factors. However, the multivariate analysis showed that the spatial component only explained one-third of the variation in child mortality trends. The results thus point towards the presence of local (non-spatial) causative factors, including variations in the access to and quality of child health care.
The method readily got rid of the defects of the conventional CPR such as the risk of rib fracture, and made full use of "heart-pump and thoracic-pump effects", and at the same time it improved the ventilation.

This kind of vulvovaginal anomalies was very rare and not enrolled into current diagnosis and treatment system. All patients had a common clinical features: menstruation bleeding and urine from the same outflow tract; and two orifices on perineum were found by bimanual examination, one orifice located under clitoris, the other orifice was anus. No vaginal vestibule and vulvar were observed between those two orifices. According to clinical features, those 6 cases were divided into 3 types: type I was persistence of distant urogenital sinus with clinical manifestation of simple labial fusion; type II was low communication between vagina and urogenital sinus (infrasphincteric), presenting with distal vaginal atresia and urethrovaginal fistula; type III was high communication (suprasphincteric) with distal vaginal atresia and more proximal urethrovaginal fistula. Type III was frequently associated with severe rectum and anus anomaly, and other malformation as well. All patients were treated by surgical correction. Basically, the principle of operation was to reconstruct perineal appearance, release the obstruction, and repair the defect and ultimately recovering the normal function. The alternative surgical methods should be considered individually.

Only the 4 cases of recurrent and failure of primary treatment of MOGCT were underwent comprehensive surgical staging. After primary surgery in 1 - 8 months, 16 cases received the non-standard chemotherapy were found the lesion again. The secondary debulking surgery was done for the 15 cases and also received the standard chemotherapy. Among of them, 8 cases were survival during follow up, 5 cases gave up the treatment and 4 patients were lost following up during the treatment.
There were not any of symptoms on diagnosis in all patients, and most of them (17 cases, 85%) were frequently detected VAIN for the abnormal pap smears or pelvic examination from cervical carcinoma patients and under the colposcopy as well as colposcopic biopsies. There were 3 cases (15%) with cervical cancer were diagnosed as VAIN during the postoperative follow up, while 17 cases (85%) of patients were accompanied with cervical cancer (12 cases) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN, 5 cases) concomitantly or antecedently. Ninety percent of patients were diagnosed as VAIN III, 17 cases (85%) were mainly localized in the upper third of vagina, and 13 cases (65%) affected to the multiple vaginal walls. Thirteen cases were performed surgery, and 7 cases were treated by irradiation. The local control rate was achieved to 100% in all of patients. Three cases (included 1 post-irradiated and 2 post-operative) were relapsed after treatment, but still be controlled completely by radiotherapy or surgery.

Of 145 cases for nephrectomy, 16 patients and 6 patients suffered from various intraoperative and postoperative complications respectively;of 522 patients treated by open stone surgery, 7 patients and 34 patients were suffered from various intraoperative and postoperative complications respectively; 57 patients with multiple renal calculi had residual calculi with overall stone-free rate 89.1%. And no case died in perioperative period.
Uric acid calculi were found in 53 cases (18.3%). The multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that low daily water intake, eating more salted and animal food, less vegetable were very closely associated with uric acid calculus. Comparing to calcium oxalate patients, the urine volume, the value of pH, urine calcium, urine oxalic acid were lower, but uric acid was higher than it. The value of pH, urine oxalic acid and citric acid were lower than them, but uric acid and urine calcium were higher than none urinary calculus peoples. Blood potassium and magnesium were lower than them.
Of 11 cases with ureteric calculi, 5 cases were rendered stone free in the first session, the other 6 cases received passive dilation by indwelling of ureteric stents for 1 to 3 weeks and underwent successful ureteroscopy with a 8/9.8 Fr rigid ureteroscope. Seventeen cases with renal calculi received MPCNL and were rendered stone free.
All of 36 cases underwent inversion-table treatment successfully and no one had cardio-cerebral accident. After following up 3 months, the radiologically documented complete stone clearance rate at 3 months group was 83.3%.
The mean operating time and therapeutic time in ESWL-URSL group was longer than that in URSL group, while the rate of polypi hyperplasia and open-surgery in ESWL-URSL group was 34.6%, 5.88% versus 28.3%, 1.59% in URSL group. There is no significant statistical difference in stone-free rate between two groups.
The HR speeded up accompanied with the irrigation time. When compared with before operation, POP, Cl(-), renin and Cre were significantly increased after operation; Hb, Hct and K(+) were significantly decreased after operation; MAP, SPO(2), Na(+), aldosterone and angiotensin II did not change significantly after operation. No serious surgery-related complication occurred in all patients.
There were no significant differences of the characteristics in the two groups. Twenty cases in CEA group underwent 23 endarterectomies (3 cases had bilateral CEA, respectively), in which 9 carotid shunt (39.1%) and 12 patching (52.2%) were used. Twenty cases in CAS group underwent 23 stents (3 cases had bilateral CSA, respectively), in which 21 emboli-protection devices (91.3%) were used. There was no significant difference in 30 d neurological complications (4.3% vs. 8.7%), acute myocardial infarction (4.3% vs. 0), and wound hematoma (8.7% vs. 0) between CEA and CAS, respectively. There was no ipsilateral transient ischemic attack or carotid restenosis at 18 months in each group. The average cost of hospitalization was (16 450.95 +/- 6188.76) vs. (70 130.15 +/- 11 999.02) RMB in CEA and CAS, respectively, with significant difference (P &lt; 0.01).
The operation time in Group A was (67 +/- 11) min, compared with (59 +/- 9) min in Group B (P &gt; 0.05). Postoperative pain and average hospital stay in Group A were significantly lower than those in Group B (P &lt; 0.05). The scores of self-assessment of the operation in Group A was higher than that in Group B 4 weeks after operation (P &lt; 0.05). The change of CEAP classification, VCSS and quality of life were significant after operation in both groups. The VCSS of Group A decreased by 4.6 +/- 2.5 compared with 4.3 +/- 2.7 in Group B (P &gt; 0.05).
Compared with total enteral and total parenteral nutrition, combined nutrition supplied more sufficient energy, the nutritional status improved more significant in short time; pre-albumin, transferrin, lymphocytes and platelet count increased significantly. The disease remission rate in combined nutrition group was 80.0%, better than 76.4% in total enteral nutrition group and 74.5% in total parenteral nutrition group. The morbidity rate was 10.9% in combined nutrition group, and it was lower than that in total enteral nutrition group and total parenteral nutrition group (25.4% and 18.2%, respectively). The length of hospital stay was shorter and the treatment was more cost-effective in combined nutrition group.
There were 612 cases who were followed up for 1-15 years and the follow-up rate was 80.5%. All patients recovered well after operation. The post-operation rate of recurrence of gallstone was 0.49%, 4.39%, 5.83%, 6.60%, 7.21% and 8.38% within the first year, the second year, the third year, the fifth year, the seventh year and the ninth year respectively, rate of recurrence of gallstone were 10.11% within both the tenth and the fifteenth year.
The findings for the first time provided the evidences that there was a clear trend for B7-H1 and IL-10 expressions to be most highly expressed in carcinoma tissue, intermediately expressed in paracarcinoma tissue, and expressed at the lowest level in normal pancreatic tissue at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences in B7-H1 and IL-10 expression between pancreatic carcinoma tissues, corresponding paracarcinoma tissues and normal pancreatic tissues at mRNA and protein levels (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the immunohistochemistry indicated that there were high expression levels of B7-H1 (60.5% +/- 12.7%) and IL-10 (65.3% +/- 16.2%) in pancreatic carcinoma tissues while there were no significant expressions in normal pancreatic tissues. Meanwhile, correlation analysis revealed that B7-H1 expression was significant associated with IL-10 level in tumor tissues at mRNA (P = 0.008, r = 0.841) and protein levels (P = 0.007, r = 0.838).
There was a tendency of decrease for the activation and concentration of insulin in both groups with the time. There was no significant difference of activation of insulin between the two groups (P = 0.347). There were no significant differences of blood glucoses between the two groups, and between the four time points in each groups (P &gt; 0.05). There were no complications association with blood glucoses in the two groups.
The average pre-operation slip ratio was (22.5 +/- 10.6)%. The pre-operation percentage disc height was 0.23 +/- 0.10, the slip angle was 4.4 degrees +/- 5.4 degrees , the lumbar lordosis angle was 43 degrees +/- 13 degrees and the sacral slope angle was 34 degrees +/- 10 degrees . The reduction ratio was (63.2 +/- 27.9)%. No correlation was found among reduction ratio with pre-operation slip ratio, slip angle and sacral slope angle, but a positive correlation between reduction ratio and the pre-operation percentage of disc height (P &lt; 0.05), a positive correlation between reduction ratio and the pre-operation lumbar lordosis angle (P &lt; 0.05) was found.
Anterior height, posterior height and width of vertebral body increased from T(1) to T(12) with the values from scoliotic groups larger than normal group. The anterior height/width ratio and anterior/posterior column ratio were also larger in scoliotic group especially at apical area.
Totally 32 patients (37 hips) were followed with average 8.7 months (7 - 12 months). The Harris before surgery was 50.5 (32 - 85), promoted to 91.0 (72 - 100), including 29 excellent, 6 good, 2 fair, and the total excellent and good rate was 94.6%. Complications include 4 patients leg length discrepancy from 1 - 2 cm, 3 patients moderate thigh pain and released after conservative therapy. No infection and dislocation was found. Twenty-one patients (23 hips) were found lucent line at the bone-metal interface from 1 - 5 mm, most common in B region and BC boundary than C, D, and CD boundary. All the patients followed was found the lucent line disappeared and refilled with bone at X film 24 weeks after surgery, however, no patients was found osteolysis and cup migration.
At day 16 of gestation, no visible diaphragm closure was observed in all fetuses. Diaphragmatic hernia was observed in 32 of the 44 rat fetuses of the CDH groups on day 18 and day 21 of gestation (72.7%). Lw/Bw of the 21d subgroups of CDH group were lower than those of corresponding control group (P &lt; 0.01). Observed under the microscope, the lungs of fetuses in CDH groups showed marked hypoplasia. The expression of TGF-beta1 was detected in cytoplasmic, without definite expression in nuclear. It was significantly stronger that the expression of TGF-beta1 was in the lungs of the CDH group than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.01).
Inflammatory cells and fibroblasts infiltrated into dermal equivalent and a few new micro-vessels had been formed in 1 week after the BDE transplantation; neo-forming micro-vessels perpendicular to wound bed had increased significantly in 2 weeks after the BDE transplantation; neo-forming micro-vessels could be observed in almost all dermal equivalents in 3 weeks after the BDE transplantation. CD34 positive signals (neo-forming micro-vessels) in 3 weeks after the BDE transplantation was much more than those in 2 weeks after the BDE transplantation, and CD34 positive signals in 2 weeks after the BDE transplantation was much more than those in 1 week after the BDE transplantation. Survival rate of intermediate split thickness skin graft were 10%, 70% and 100% respectively after the skin grafts had been grafted for 2 weeks on surface of the scaffold which had been transplanted for 1, 2 and 3 weeks. Epidermis which had been grafted on surface of the scaffold for 1 or 2 weeks could perfectly survive after BDE had been transplanted for 1 or 2 weeks.
We demonstrate here that depending on the type of inhibitor, relative neutralization potencies are shifted to a variable extent and direction on TZM-bl and PBMC cells. In our assay set up, differences in inhibitor activity were solely effected by the target cell environment and amounted up to 2-3 logs lower activity on TZM-bl cells in several cases. Overall, neutralizing antibodies, 2G12, 2F5 and 4E10, were less active in the TZM-bl system, whereas CD4 binding site directed inhibitor activities were detected equally well on both target cells, raising concerns that the TZM-bl assay may overrate the relevance of CD4 binding site specific responses.
IL-7 stimulation failed to activate STAT5 in a substantial proportion of patient CD8 T cells. This correlated with reduced IL-7Ralpha mRNA and surface protein expression. Interestingly, IL-7Ralpha(low) cells appeared to be fully capable of recruiting the STAT pathway in response to IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15. mRNA expression suggested a potential role for growth factor independent (Gfi)-1 as an IL-7Ralpha transcriptional repressor, but not that of other transcriptional regulators studied, including Gfi-1B and GA-binding protein alpha. Programmed death-1 inhibitory receptor, though upregulated in CD8 T cells from HIV-positive patients, appeared unrelated to IL-7Ralpha expression and STAT signaling capacity.
Of the 327 students enrolled, 175 of students responded to the questionnaire. Six percent of the students currently smoke while 24% of students reported cigarette smoking at some point in their life. Eighty-six percent of students currently drink, with a majority drinking fewer than 11 drinks per week. Fifteen percent of students were at an increased risk for problem drinking according to the CAGE questionnaire. An increased risk for problem drinking was significantly related to believing more strongly that getting drunk is acceptable on occasion and less strongly that increased alcohol has many negative health consequences, as well as feeling less in control of alcohol consumption.
The groups were anxiety provoking; most participants were able to progressively accommodate to and benefit from the psychological learning process, but some struggled to adapt.
One hundred seventy three students reported a total of 4,676 patient encounters, averaging 27.2 encounters per student and 1.8 psychiatric diagnoses per patient. Students met "learning targets" for anxiety disorder, bipolar affective disorder, depression, personality disorder (borderline), posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, and substance abuse (alcohol), but not for disorders more likely seen in outpatient settings. For the 10 counseling skills learning targets, students only met those for family issues. In the four "newer" competency domains, students reported struggling with issues in 0.3% to 12.6% of encounters. Students documented being challenged by professionalism issues most often and recorded examples of how these competencies played out for them during the clerkship.
Psychiatry clerkship had an overall positive attitude toward psychiatric illness, patients, and psychiatrists, but no effect on students' choice of psychiatry as a career.
Since its inception, all scholarly activities have increased under the PART program. The 89 residents, followed over 5 academic years, co-authored 32 publications, gave 56 presentations, and received prestigious honors such as NIMH fellowships and national research awards.
A number of key elements crucial to the construction and review of grant applications were identified. It was acknowledged that intervention-related studies unavoidably involve trade-offs. Reviewers are helped when applications acknowledge such trade-offs and provide good rationale for their choices. Clear linkage among the design, aims, hypotheses, and data analysis plan and avoidance of disconnections among these elements also strengthens applications.
There is tremendous promise for rewarding experiences in international research projects due to the collaboration, mutual learning, and cultural bridging that intrinsically occur. However, there are also inherent cross-national procedural requirements that can be demanding in time and effort for the investigator and other stakeholders of the grant.
Weighted publication scores correlate with total publication rates at such a high rate that the two scores can be used interchangeably. Forty-three percent of graduates average at least one publication per year after completing the postdoctoral program; 20% were listed as an independent investigator on a larger federal grant. The number of publications published during postdoctoral training and additional funded training beyond that provided by the institutional NRSA are correlated with increased posttraining program publication rates; other factors including gender, terminal degree, number of publications prior to postdoctoral training, and mentor variables had no significant impact. Additional funded training, male gender, and increased time since completion of the training are associated with increased likelihood of larger grant federal funding.
Scientists and clinicians were strikingly unfamiliar with each other's worldviews, work experiences, professional expectations, and approaches to teaching. The partnership model appeared to influence integration at a social level, and led to the identification of departmental structural barriers that aggravate the divide between scientists and clinical teachers. Issues related to the integration of social scientists in particular emerged.
During a 4-year period reported, the total direct costs of all grants increased 40% and the total number of publications increased 108% during this same time frame.
The key to a strong proposal is linkage among all of its sections, from the specific aims to the budget. The specific aims should be justified by the need for the conference and articulated in the background and significance section, and the aims, in turn, should drive the content and format of the conference.
In HCT116 cells, the knockdown of ST6Gal-I inhibited cell motility, but did not affect cell adhesion. This selectively altered cell migration was caused by the loss of alpha2,6-sialic acid structures on c-Met. Moreover, STAT3 was dephosphorylated at tyrosine 705 in ST6Gal-I-knockdown (ST6Gal-I-KD) HCT116 cells.
In post-MI rats, AVE8134 dose-dependently improved cardiac output, myocardial contractility and relaxation and reduced lung and left ventricular weight and fibrosis. In contrast, rosiglitazone exacerbated cardiac dysfunction. Treatment at AVE8134 decreased plasma proBNP and arginine and increased plasma citrulline and urinary NOx/creatinine ratio. In DOCA rats, AVE8134 prevented development of high blood pressure, myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis, and ameliorated endothelial dysfunction. Compound treatment increased cardiac protein expression and phosphorylation of eNOS. In old SHR, treatment with a low dose of AVE8134 improved cardiac and vascular function and increased life expectancy without lowering blood pressure. AVE8134 reduced phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy in adult rat cardiomyocytes. In HUVEC, Ser-1177-eNOS phosphorylation but not eNOS expression was increased. In monocytes, AVE8134 increased the expression of CD36 and the macrophage scavenger receptor 1, resulting in enhanced uptake of oxidized LDL.
JG3 abolished heparanase-driven formation of focal adhesions and cell spreading. Although JG3 failed to block the heparanase-triggered activation of beta1-integrin or the phosphorylation of Src, the oligosaccharide caused a significant dephosphorylation of FAK and subsequent inactivation of Erk. Furthermore, JG3 was found to arrest the activation of Rac1.
Differences in mRNA basal levels of the transporters were as follows: ABCC2&gt;ABCG2&gt;ABCB1&gt;SLCO1B1&gt;&gt;&gt;SLC22A1&gt;SLC O2B1 for HepG2 cells, and SLCO2B1&gt;&gt;ABCC2&gt;ABCB1&gt;ABCG2&gt;&gt;&gt;SLC22A1 for Caco-2 cells. While for HepG2 cells, ABCC2, ABCG2 and SLCO2B1 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated at 1, 10 and 20 micromol/L after 12 or 24 h treatment, in Caco-2 cells, only the efflux transporter ABCB1 was significantly down-regulated by two-fold following a 12 h treatment with atorvastatin. Interestingly, whereas treatment with simvastatin had no effect on mRNA levels of the transporters in HepG2 cells, in Caco-2 cells the statin significantly down-regulated ABCB1, ABCC2, SLC22A1, and SLCO2B1 mRNA levels after 12 or 24 h treatment.
The pharmacokinetic results showed that AUC(0-t) (23.9+/-8.26 microg.h.mL(-1)) in plasma after oral administration was significantly higher than after transdermal delivery (1.00+/-0.43 microg.h.mL(-1)). In contrast, the ratio of the average concentration in synovial fluid to that in plasma following transdermal administration was higher than that for an oral delivery. The synovial fluid concentration in the treated leg was much higher than that in the untreated leg, whereas the synovial fluid concentration in the untreated leg was similar to the plasma concentration.
We report that MS80, a new kind of sulfated oligosaccharide extracted from seaweed, inhibits TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Our results indicated that MS80 competitively inhibited heparin/HS-TGF-beta1 interaction through its high binding affinity for TGF-beta1. Moreover, MS80 arrested TGF-beta1-induced human embryo pulmonary fibroblast (HEPF) cell proliferation, collagen deposition and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Intriguingly, MS80 deactivated both the ERK and p38 signaling pathways. MS80 was also a potent suppressor of bleomycin-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, as evidenced by improved pathological settings and decreased lung collagen contents.
After 30 min of global no-flow ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion, myocardial function had better recovery rates in CIHH guinea pig hearts than in control hearts. The activity and protein expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly increased in the myocardium of CIHH guinea pigs. Pretreatment of control hearts with an antioxidant mixture containing SOD and CAT exerted cardioprotective effects similar to CIHH. The irreversible CAT inhibitor aminotriazole (ATZ) abolished the cardioprotection of CIHH. Cardiac contractile dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) were attenuated by CIHH and CAT.
Our results indicated that recombinant BMP6 induced ALP activity in a dose-dependent and time-course-dependent manner. Treatment with TGF-beta1 reduced both the cell proliferation and the expression of E-cadherin, induced a morphological transformation, decreased the expression and activity of MMP-2, and increased the expression levels of alpha-SMA, fibronectin, and TIMP-2 in HK-2 cells. All of these effects were inhibited when cells were treated with TGF-beta1 in combination with rhBMP6, whereas rhBMP6 alone demonstrated no such effect. Treatment with TGF-beta1, rhBMP6, or a combination of both had no effect on the expression of collagen IV. In addition, the administration of rhBMP6 prevented the enhanced adhesion behavior triggered by TGF-beta1. Furthermore, the addition of rhBMP6 abrogated the JNK and Smad2/3 signaling that was activated by TGF-beta1.
The A(1)R agonist CPA causes protein kinase B (Akt) activation and protects primary cortical neurons from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) insult. A(1)R and EGFR co-localize in the membranes of neurons and form an immunocomplex. A(1)R stimulation induces significant EGFR phosphorylation via a PI3K and Src kinase signaling pathway; this stimulation provides a neuroprotective effect in cortical neurons. CPA leads to sustained phosphorylation of extracellularly regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in cortical neurons, but only to transient phosphorylation in HEK 293/A(1)R cells. The response to the A(1)R agonist is mediated primarily through EGFR transactivation that is dependent on pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G(i) protein and metalloproteases in HEK 293/A(1)R.
Pretreated neurons with liquiritigenin in the presence of Abeta(25-35) increased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Liquiritigenin treatment also attenuated Abeta(25-35)-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS level and decreased the apoptotic rate of neurons. Some genes, including B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), neurotrophin 3 (Ntf-3) and amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein-binding, family B, member 1 (Apbb-1) were regulated by liquiritigenin; similar results were shown at the protein level by Western blotting.
We obtained a high percentage of MAP2-positive neurons derived from embryoid bodies (EBs) induced by RA by administering 1 mmol/L NAC at differentiation day 0. On differentiation day 8, the expression of MAP2 protein was strongly upregulated in the presence of NAC. NAC promoted neuron differentiation of ES cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Notably, NAC suppressed cell death caused by RA during neuron differentiation. In addition, neurite extension of SCG neurons was greatly stimulated in the presence of NAC.
Cotransfection of Ngb-siRNA with Ngb-GFP plasmids suppressed the expression of Ngb-GFP in N2a cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that the expression of endogenous Ngb was successfully knocked down to about 20% in N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells compared with control cells. A WST-8 assay demonstrated that viability was significantly decreased in N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells and N2a cells transiently transfected with Ngb-siRNA plasmids compared with controls following hydrogen peroxide treatment. An LDH assay demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the death of Ngb-siRNA-transfected N2a cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment. Hoechst staining demonstrated that the quantity of apoptotic cells among N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment significantly increased compared with controls. In N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells, the expression level of activated caspase-3 significantly increased, whereas the expression of 14-3-3gamma decreased compared with that of N2a/vec cells. Transfection of 14-3-3gamma plasmids significantly enhanced the viability of N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment compared with vector controls.
On the 14th day after MCAO, Beclin1 downregulation by RNAi increased the population of neural progenitor cells (BrdU(+)-DCX(+)), newborn immature cells (BrdU(+)-Tuj-1(+)) and mature neurons (BrdU(+)-MAP-2(+)), and reduced the apoptosis of immature neurons (caspase-3(+)-DCX(+) and caspase-3(+)-Tuj-1(+)) surrounding the ischemic core of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated downregulation of Beclin1 decreased infarct volume and inhibited histological injury and neurological deficits.
Stimulation of beta-AR by the agonist isoproterenol for 5 min induces the up-regulation of nonphosphorylated Cx43 protein level, but not total Cx43. Selective beta(2)-AR inhibitor ICI 118551, but not beta(1)-AR inhibitor CGP20712, could fully abolish the effect. Moreover, pretreatment with both protein kinase A inhibitor H89 and G(i) protein inhibitor pertussis toxin also inhibited the isoproterenol-induced increase of nonphosphorylated Cx43 expression. Isoproterenol-induced up-regulation of nonphosphorylated Cx43 is accompanied with enhanced GJIC function.
In asthmatic E3 rats, beta(2) adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of airway smooth muscle pre-contracted with 5-HT was inhibited, and there were no obvious difference in relaxation compared with normal E3 rats. Contraction of lobar bronchi mediated by 5-HT and sarafotoxin 6c was more potent than in the trachea or main bronchi. Airway contractions mediated by the endothelin (ET)(A) receptor, ET(B) receptor and M(3) muscarinic receptor were augmented, and the augmented contraction was most obvious in lobar bronchi. The order of efficacy of contraction for lobar bronchi induced by agonists was ET-1, sarafotoxin 6c&gt;ACh&gt;5-HT. OX8 (an antibody against CD8(+) T cells) strongly shifted and OX35 (an antibody against CD4(+) T cells) modestly shifted isoprenaline-induced concentration-relaxation curves in a nonparallel fashion to the left with an increased R(max) in asthmatic rats and sarafotoxin 6c-induced concentration-contractile curves to the right with a decreased E(max).
Compared with the mice untreated with NAC, mice in the AMB plus NAC group had increased SOD and reduced MDA levels both systemically and locally at 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation with conidia. NAC treatment also decreased the pulmonary protein content at 48 and 72 h and the lung wet/dry weight ratio at 24 and 48 h. Additionally, NAC enhanced pulmonary production of TNF-alpha and IL-10 at 24 h and 48 h.
Balsalazine was found to reduce the DAI score and the histological index (HI) score, decrease the MDA content and the activity of MPO, and increase the activity of SOD and GSH-Px in colitis mice. At the same time, balsalazine ameliorated microvillus and tight junction structure, resulting in a decrease in the amount of Evans blue permeating into the intestinal wall and the levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in colitis mice.
The proteomics analysis indicated that a total of 26 proteins were up- or down-regulated in the Itm group compared with the Ctr group at 6 h and 24 h; among these, 15 proteins were successfully identified. These proteins mainly belong to the cytoskeleton and molecular chaperone protein families, and most of these have anti-apoptotic effects in various cells. Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha (RhoGDIalpha) and vimentin were the most significantly changed proteins. Further studies by IHC showed that the expression of RhoGDIalpha in ROBs was significantly higher in PTH-treated sham-operated rats than in vehicle-treated sham-operated rats, but the difference was not significant between PTH-treated and vehicle-treated OVX rats. Vimentin expression was not changed in either PTH-treated sham-operated rats or PTH-treated OVX rats.
YCP had an in vitro stimulatory effect on the release of NO in macrophage, and fl-YCP can bind directly to receptors on the surface of macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Competition studies show that LPS, laminarin, anti-TLR4 antibody and anti-CD11b (CR3) antibody could inhibit fl-YCP binding to macrophages. Conversely, mannose, anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR6 antibody could not. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with YCP resulted in significant activation of p38 in a time-dependent manner. The specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 abrogated YCP-induced NO generation. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with anti-TLR4 antibody and anti-CR3 antibody significantly reduced YCP-induced NO production and p38 activation.
Arbidol was found to have potent inhibitory activity against HTNV when added in vitro before or after viral infection, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 0.9 and 1.2 microg/mL, respectively. The 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of arbidol for suckling mice was 78.42 mg.kg(-1).d(-1). Oral administration of arbidol increased both survival rate and mean time to death (MTD). Treatment with arbidol reduced histopathological changes, decreased viral load and viral antigen levels, and modulated the level of serum TNF-alpha.
There was a significant reduction in cell proliferation after treatment with LDM. The overall growth inhibition correlated with increased apoptotic cell death. LDM-induced cell apoptosis was associated with the activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and cleavage of caspase-3/7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). LDM markedly suppressed tumor growth in a murine myeloma model.
MG-132 inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell death and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase, and activated autophagy in SHG-44 glioma cells. The expression of autophagy-related Beclin-1 and LC3-I was significantly up-regulated and part of LC3-I was converted into LC3-II. However, when SHG-44 glioma cells were co-treated with MG-132 and 3-MA, the cells became less viable, but cell death and cell numbers at G(2)/M phase increased. Moreover, the accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles was decreased, the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 was significantly down-regulated and the conversion of LC3-II from LC3-I was also inhibited.
The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 expresses a lower level of SSTR2, thereby partly accounting for the decreased response to SST. The overexpression of SSTR2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in apoptosis, cytostasis and G(1)/S cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the expression of EGFR, together with EGF-stimulated proliferation, was markedly decreased in the MCF-7/pSIG cells.
The ELISA showed that the plasma level of estradiol in the HRT group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05). No differences were observed in the MMSE between the two groups. In participants older than 70 years of age, the number of deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs) in the control group was significantly higher than that in the HRT group (P=0.0013); however, in other age subgroups, no statistical differences were observed. Finally, no significant difference in periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) between the two groups was observed.
The rate of successful intubation of the mannequins was constant, with a linear regression slope of 0.00016 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.0039, 0.0042). A generalized estimation equations logistic regression comparing success rates between the pre-intervention and the intervention periods showed no statistical difference (P=.63, z=0.48), with an odds ratio of 1.37 (95% CI: 0.38, 4.92). However, compliance with the study declined significantly over the intervention period, as indicated by a linear regression slope of 0.0239 (95% CI: -.0354, -0.0124).
A total of 396 patients were included in the analysis, consisting of 179 Hispanics and 217 NHW. Overall, fewer Hispanics completed therapy compared with NHW (64.8% vs. 80.2%, P&lt;0.001). In genotype 1 patients, early virologic response (EVR), end-of-treatment response (ETR), and sustained virologic response (SVR) did not differ significantly between the two ethnic groups. In genotype 2 and 3 patients, Hispanics had similar EVR compared with NHW (81.3% vs. 88.2%, P=0.25), but lower ETR (64.1% vs. 83.1%, P=0.01) and SVR (45.3% vs. 75.3%, P&lt;0.001). After correcting for patients who prematurely discontinued therapy, genotype 2 and 3 Hispanics continued to have a reduced SVR compared with NHW (65.9% vs. 87.3%, P=0.014). The attenuated SVR in Hispanics was because of a higher relapse rate after achieving ETR compared with NHW (25% vs. 7.5%, P=0.02).
There were an estimated 1.6 million ED visits for acute pancreatitis, 2.2 million visits for appendicitis, 1.2 million visits for cholecystitis, and 3.9 million visits for UGIH in the NHAMCS survey during the study period. Average wait time ranged from 48 min (acute pancreatitis) to 61 min (cholecystitis). We identified a delay in clinical assessment in 24% of cases. In multivariate analysis, race/ethnicity was an independent predictor for increased wait time. HW waited longer and had higher frequency of delays compared with NHW for all four disease groups.
There were 93 patients in the H. pylori-eradication group, 83 in the non-eradication controls, and 100 in the negative controls to complete the study. The negative controls had no progression of AT and IM during follow-up. For the H. pylori-positive eradication group, there was significant regression of AT and IM during follow-up (P&lt;0.05). In the H. pylori-positive non-treated controls, the prevalence rates of AT and IM were significantly greater on the second year than on enrollment (P&lt;0.05). During the second-year follow-up, the patients in the eradication group achieved more regression and less development of AT and IM than did the non-eradication controls (P&lt;0.001).
MRCP-S showed abnormal pancreatic morphological findings in 13 of the 25 CPH cases (52%) and 1/28 controls (3.6%) (P&lt;0.001). MRCP findings consistent with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, according to the Cambridge classification, were detected in eight CPH cases (32%) after secretin injection but none of the controls. Secretin stimulation boosted the diagnostic yield of MRCP for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis fourfold. Pancreas divisum was identified in two CPH cases and one control. A 15-min persisting dilation of the main pancreatic duct was noted in three cases in each group. Compared with MRCP, MRCP-S showed significantly fewer CPH patients with normal findings (P&lt;0.02).
There was a significant difference in mean dysphagia grade between treatment arms 6 weeks following treatment (P=0.046), with worse swallowing reported by rigid stent-treated patients (mean dysphagia score difference=-0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to -0.89, P=0.014). Global QL scores were lower at both 1 and 6 weeks following treatment for patients treated by SEMSs (mean difference QL index week 1=-0.66; 95% CI: -0.02 to -1.30, P=0.04; mean difference QL index week 6=-1.01; 95% CI -0.30 to -1.72, P=0.006). These findings were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores in the SEMS patient group (mean difference of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C-30 pain symptom score at week 1=11.13; 95% CI: 2.89-19.4; P=0.01). Although mean EQ-5D QL values differed between the treatments (P&lt;0.001), this difference dissipated following generation of quality-adjusted life year values. Total costs varied between treatment arms but these findings canceled out when SEMSs were compared with non-SEMS therapies (95% CI -845.15-1,332.62). These results were robust to sensitivity analysis. There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or early complication rates, but late complications were more frequent after rigid stenting (risk ratio=2.47; 95% CI 1.88-3.04). There was a survival advantage for non-stent-treated patients (log-rank statistic=4.21, P=0.04).
Three of the five celiac disease risk markers had a protective effect on UC susceptibility, and this effect remained significant after correcting for multiple testing: rs6840978: P=0.0082, P(corr)=0.049, odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.93; rs6822844: P=0.0028, P(corr)=0.017, OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.90; rs13119723: P=0.0058, P(corr)=0.035, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.92. A haplotype consisting of the six SNPs tested was markedly associated with UC susceptibility (P=0.0025, P(corr)=0.015, OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.89). Moreover, in UC, epistasis was observed between the IL23R SNP rs1004819 and three SNPs in the KIAA1109/TENR/IL2/IL21 block (rs13151961, rs13119723, and rs6822844).
The MIBDI had good sensitivity compared with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HB; 0.88), Powell-Tuck Index (PT; 0.84), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ; 0.89), which was maintained at two subsequent annual measurements. Test-retest reliability was also strong (Spearman's r=0.81). Discriminant function analyses identified common discriminating variables of active disease for CD and UC that included HB, PT, and IBDQ subscales of bowel and systemic symptoms, prolonged symptom severity (e.g., abdominal and joint pain, tiredness, diarrhea), and recent persistent pain related to IBD. Unique discriminators included weight problems (CD) and blood in stool (UC).
The TLR9 -1237T/C polymorphism showed significant interactions with NOD2 mutations. The frequency of -1237C was significantly higher in CD patients with at least one NOD2 mutation (P=0.004 vs. controls, odds ratio (OR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.15-2.21)) and further increased in CD patients with two mutated NOD2 alleles (P=0.002 vs. controls, OR 2.37, 95% CI (1.35-4.15)). Significant gene-gene interactions were also observed for the TLR9 polymorphism -1237T/C with IL23R variants (most significantly with rs1004819, P=0.0007), with a particular high frequency of -1237C in CD patients carrying CD-protective IL23R variants. Epistatic interactions of the TLR9 -1237T/C SNP were also noted with the DLG5 113G/A variant (P=0.0007).
During an 11.5-year mean follow-up, 314 carriers developed reactivation of hepatitis B (ALT was more than twice the upper limit of normal and positive HBV DNA was found using hybridization assays). The risk of reactivation of hepatitis B correlated significantly with advanced age at study entry (P&lt;0.0001) and male sex (P&lt;0.0001). A total of 57 patients developed cirrhosis, with the cumulative incidence being 15% after 25 years. The risk of cirrhosis correlated significantly with advanced age at entry (P=0.004) and reactivation of hepatitis B (P&lt;0.0001). Of the 1,651 carriers without reactivation of hepatitis B, 10 developed cirrhosis, and advanced age at entry was the only significant factor (P=0.03). Of the 314 patients with reactivation of hepatitis B, cirrhosis developed in 47 of them, with the cumulative incidence being 8, 16, 27, and 46% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively, after the onset of reactivation. Male sex (P=0.037) and advanced age at reactivation (P=0.006) were the two independent risk factors.
C. albicans was isolated significantly more frequently from stool samples from CD patients (44%) and their HRs (38%) than from controls (22%) (P&lt;0.05). The prevalence of ACMAs was similar between CD patients, their HRs, and controls (22, 19, and 21%, respectively, P=0.845), whereas the prevalence of ASCAs was significantly increased in CD families (72 and 34% in CD and HRs, respectively, in contrast to 4% in controls, P&lt;0.0001). AMCA levels correlated with C. albicans colonization in all populations. ASCA levels correlated with C. albicans colonization in HRs but not in CD patients.
Of 213 eligible transplant patients, 42 were excluded. Of the 171 remaining patients, 78% were male; mean age was 52 years. Overall 53% of patients had co-existing causes of liver dysfunction. The mean follow-up was 64.8 months. The median pre-transplant abstinence was 19 months. In all patients, the risk of AD was 24% and PD 13%. Pre-transplant abstinence duration was the only independent predictor of PD after transplant. For every 1-month increment in pre-transplant abstinence, there was a 5% decrease in the adjusted relapse rate. There was no survival difference noted between problem drinkers and non-drinkers.
The strategic search identified 1,593 citations. A total of 29 RCTs were eligible for inclusion; placebo was compared with 5-HT(3) antagonists in 11 RCTs, with tegaserod in 11, and with mixed 5-HT(3) antagonists/5-HT(4) agonists in 7. The study quality was generally high. The RR of IBS symptoms persisting with 5-HT(3) antagonists vs. placebo was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71-0.86), with a similar benefit for both alosetron and cilansetron. Tegaserod was also superior to placebo (RR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.80-0.90). Renzapride and cisapride had no benefit in IBS.
Five patients presented with variceal bleeding, two with splenomegaly, and one with ascites. All had large esophageal varices. Median hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 8 mm Hg (range 3.5-14.5), clearly underestimating the true portal pressure. This is probably because of a presinusoidal component of PH and because of the presence of intrahepatic venous collaterals. Median liver stiffness was 8.9 kPa (range 6.8-14.9) and was unreliable in predicting the presence of fibrosis or of esophageal varices. The main histological features were absence of portal vein radicles and areas of regenerating hepatocytes. Six patients (75%) developed portal vein thrombosis during a 2-year follow-up.
Correlation of FASN with various clinicopathological parameters on 448 CRC samples was assessed. Activated AKT was found in 294/409 (71.9%) of CRC and was associated with FASN overexpression. FASN expression was observed in 27.1% (109/403) of Middle Eastern CRC. Additionally, FASN expression was significantly more common in tumors characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) than in those characterized by microsatellite stability (MSS) (P&lt;0.01). Our in vitro data using HCT-15, an MSI CRC cell line, showed a better apoptotic response after inhibition of FASN activity as compared with Colo-320, an MSS CRC cell line. Finally, treatment of HCT-15 cell line xenografts with C-75 resulted in growth inhibition of tumors in NUDE mice via downregulation of FASN and AKT activity.
3,719 Subjects (1,544 men and 2,175 women), aged 25-84 years who did not have serologically diagnosable chronic liver diseases or excessive consumption of alcohol, had their levels of ALT measured. The prevalence of Met S was 17% in men and 15% in women. In age-adjusted analyses, ALT was significantly associated with Met S and each of its five components and the association with Met S remained significant after adjustment for insulin resistance. There was no positive association between ALT and incident CVD events over the 10-year follow-up period in age-adjusted or multivariate-adjusted analyses.
Of the 501 eligible subjects, 461 (92%) provided complete data (mean age=56 years, 49% female). IBS (Rome II criteria) was associated with both higher SSC and Global Severity Index (GSI of SCL-90-R) scores. Among subjects with high (75th percentile) SSC scores, 43% reported IBS vs. 10% of those with low (&lt;25th percentile) SSC scores. Among those with high (60) GSI scores, 23% reported IBS vs. 6% with low (&lt;40) GSI scores. Specifically, none of the IBS subjects had both low SSC and low GSI scores.
The majority of reflux events consisted of both gaseous and liquid reflux with a significant increase in non-acid, mixed reflux episodes in +HH patients compared with those in -HH patients. Acid exposure time was in the normal range in both patient groups during both placebo and baclofen. In this study, baclofen significantly reduced the total number of reflux episodes with 36% in -HH patients and 43% in +HH patients, but did not change the number of acid reflux episodes or total acid exposure time.
A total of 3,619 colonoscopies were included, of which 1,748 (48.3%) were done in the morning and 1,871 (51.7%) were done in the afternoon. ADR was 29.3% in the morning group compared with 25.3% in the afternoon group (P=0.008). There was a trend toward declining ADR for each subsequent hour of the day (P=0.01). In multivariable analysis, colonoscopy in the morning was significantly associated with increased ADR (odds ratio (OR) 1.2 (1.06, 1.4) P=0.006).
All procedures were successful; 8,431 of 10,662 patients (79.1%) completed diagnostic EGD with a single bolus of propofol. Only 0.26% (28 patients) required transient supplemental oxygen supply; neither mask ventilation nor endotracheal intubation was required. Full recovery occurred in 99.9% of patients 60 min after the procedure. Men and younger patients required significantly higher doses of propofol than did the women and older patients (men vs. women, 46.5+/-19 vs. 42.7+/-15 mg, P=0.0008; age 40-49 vs. age 50-59, 51.5+/-16 vs. 46.3+/-13 mg, P&lt;0.0001). Of the 400 patients, 368 (92%) wanted to drive home or to their offices, and all did so without incident. A total of 99% were willing to repeat the same procedure again.
Upper GI complications fell from 87/100,000 persons in 1996 to 47/100,000 persons in 2005, whereas lower GI complications increased from 20/100,000 to 33/100,000. Overall, mortality rates decreased, but the case fatality remained constant over time. Lower GI events had a higher mortality rate (8.8 vs. 5.5%), a longer hospitalization (11.6+/-13.9 vs. 7.9+/-8.8 days), and higher resource utilization than did upper GI events. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without concomitant proton pump inhibitor was more frequently recorded among upper GI complications than among lower GI complications. When comparing upper GI events with lower GI events, we found that male gender (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.70-2.21), and recorded NSAID use (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.60-2.30) were associated to a greater extent with upper GI events, whereas older age (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77-0.89), number of comorbidities (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86-0.96), and having a diagnosis in recent years (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90-0.94) were all associated to a greater extent with lower GI events than with upper GI events after adjusting for age, sex, hospitalization, and discharge year.
A total of 3894 10-fold dosing errors involving a single substance in children younger than six years of age were reported over a five-year period. The site of exposure was most commonly a residence (n = 3609, 92.7%), followed by a health care facility (n = 223, 5.7%) and a school (n = 32, 0.8%). More than half of the exposures occurred in children 12 months of age or younger. When stratified by age, histamine H(2)- receptor antagonists and metoclopramide were the most common medications involved in exposures in children 12 months of age and younger. Cough and cold preparations and antibiotics were the most commonly involved medications in therapeutic errors in children over age 12 months.
The isolates were predominantly multidrug resistant (&gt;79.5%) and comprised of thirteen unique pulsotypes, with genotype VII circulating in both hospitals. The presence of bla(OXA-23) in 13% (11/83) and IS(Aba1) linked bla(OXA-66) in 79.5% (66/83) of clinical isolates was associated with high level imipenem resistance. In this set of OXA producing isolates, multidrug resistance was bestowed by bla(ADC-25), class 1 integron-borne aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, presence of sense mutations in gyrA/parC and involvement of active efflux (with evidence for the presence of adeB efflux gene).
Only one physician could not complete the program. Half of them worked at the University Hospital (UH) with half of them for less than three years. Lectures and standard mannequin-based driven workshops significantly improved physician's theoretical knowledge. Practical performance during difficult airway management scenarios was poor.
The ScvO(2) before transfusion was greater or equal to 70% in 25 (47.2%) patients. Following BT, the ScvO(2) increased significantly (from 57.8 to 68.5%) in the group with initial ScvO(2) less than 70% whereas it was unchanged in patients with initial ScvO(2) greater or equal 70% (from 76.8 to 76.5%). Twenty patients (37.7%) did not meet the French guidelines for BT criteria. Eighteen patients out of 33 that met the criteria had ScvO(2) greater or equal 70% before BT while 13 patients with ScvO(2) less than 70% were not detected by these same criteria.
Among 33 patients, there were 24 responders. At baseline, BNP plasma values were less in responders (328 [35-1190] pg/ml versus 535 [223-5000] pg/ml, p&lt;0.03). The area under the ROC curves was 0.74+/-0.11, that was similar to the area under the ROC curve for CVP (0.77+/-0.10). The best cut-off value of plasma BNP level for predicting fluid responsiveness was 193 pg/ml (sensitivity: 38%, specificity: 100%, positive predictive value: 100%, negative predictive value: 38%, accuracy: 55%). Fluid challenge did not increase plasma BNP concentrations in responders and nonresponders.
CO(PAC) ranged from 2.6 to 11.0 l/min and CO(ICG) ranged from 1.8 to 11.7 l/min. There was a significant relationship between CO(PAC) and CO(ICG) (r=0.61 ; p&lt;0.001). Agreement between CO(PAC) and CO(ICG) was -0.5+/-1.3 l/min (Bland-Altman analysis). Percentage error between the two methods was 49% (Critchley and Critchley's analysis).
Most results were related to pain studies. We selected various examples to describe how genetic polymorphisms impacts the pharmacology of a given drug, and what are the clinical consequences.
Of 93 recruited participants, 60 (65%) were followed up at 2 and 6 weeks: 50% (30) had boils, 37% (22) had impetigo, 83% (50) were prescribed antibiotics, and active follow up was suggested for 47% (28). Thirty percent (18) and 15% (9) of participants had nonhealed lesions at 2 and 6 weeks respectively. No associations between nonhealing and any modifiable factors investigated were identified. However, indigenous patients were more likely to have nonhealed lesions at 2 weeks and new lesions at 6 weeks.
A total of 161 patients completed the questionnaires. Fifty-five percent (83) of patients had a K10 score that indicated medium or high risk, and 44% (71) had a high SPHERE score (PSYCH-6 and/or SOMA-6). There was an association between increased risk of depression or anxiety and reduced occupational status but not social isolation.
Of 187 doctors who had an active responding email address, 140 (75%) took the examination. From a possible score of 100, the mean score was 84 +/- 16. The median score was 80.
Almost two-thirds of respondents (63%) had experienced MSD of the lower back, 57% had experienced neck-related MSD, 52% had experienced shoulder-related MSD and 34% had experienced MSD of the upper back during the previous 12 months. MSD was statistically correlated with a range of psychosocial factors, including stress associated with career structure, time pressures, client's attitude, lack of recognition by the public, lack of recognition by colleagues, lack of understanding from family or partners and work stress because of insufficient holidays each year.
No highly pathogenic AI viruses were identified. However, 164 PCR tests were positive for the AI type A matrix gene, 46 of which were identified to subtype. A total of five viruses were isolated, three of which had a corresponding positive PCR and subtype identification (H3N8, H4N6, H7N6). Low pathogenic AI H5 and/or H7 was present in wild birds in New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. Antibodies to influenza A were also detected in 15.0% of the birds sampled.
There was a significant difference between the two extenders in the motility of spermatozoa after cryopreservation (48.9% for INRA 96; 38.6% for EZ Mixin OF; P &lt; 0.0001). Glycerol at 4% in freezing medium yielded the highest post-thaw motility, significantly better than 2% (P &lt; 0.05). Three of four stallions had significantly higher post-thaw motility using INRA 96 relative to EZ Mixin OF (P &lt; 0.01), and two of four stallions had significantly higher post-thaw motility using 4% glycerol (P &lt; 0.05). The combination of INRA 96 and 4% glycerol in freezing medium gave the highest average post-thaw motility of 51.5%.
A reference range for Australian cats calculated using the central 95th percentile in the 50 clinically healthy cats was 345 to 3668 pg/mL. Median serum cobalamin concentration in 47 cats with non-alimentary tract illness (1186 pg/mL; range 117-3480) was not significantly different to the median serum cobalamin of the 50 healthy cats (1213 pg/mL, range 311-3688). Using the calculated reference range one sick cat with non-alimentary tract illness had a markedly low serum cobalamin concentration.
After 2 days, pruritus was reduced by 94% in the treatment group and by 24% in the control group (P = 0.014) in cumulative time, and by 86% versus 34% (P = 0.034) in frequency. The HCA spray also resulted in significant improvements in overall clinical signs: 23% versus 0% in the control group (P = 0.0006) on day 3 and 43% versus 15% in the control group (P = 0.0006) on day 7. During the 7-day trial, no drug-related adverse effects were observed.
In normal cats the mean MAX-ACT was 66 s (range 55-85 s). In normal dogs the mean was 71 s (range 55-80 s). There was no statistical difference between the first and second samples collected from the same needle insertion.
Here, we present a globally optimized implementation of the eBURST algorithm - goeBURST. The search for a global optimal solution led to the formalization of the problem as a graphic matroid, for which greedy algorithms that provide an optimal solution exist. Several public data sets of MLST data were tested and differences between the two implementations were found and are discussed for five bacterial species: Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria spp.. A novel feature implemented in goeBURST is the representation of the level of tiebreak rule reached before deciding if a link should be drawn, which can used to visually evaluate the reliability of the represented hypothetical pattern of descent.
We developed an improved method for detecting substructural similarities in proteins using tableaux. Tableaux are compared efficiently by solving the quadratic program (QP) corresponding to the quadratic integer program (QIP) formulation of the extraction of maximally-similar tableaux. We compare the accuracy of the method in classifying protein folds with some existing techniques.
94% and 71% of the NSCLC samples expressed GM3 and nuclear pSTAT3, respectively. Median overall survival was 40.0 months. Both low GM3 expression and high pSTAT3 expression were associated with a worse survival, which reached near significance for GM3 (P = 0.08). Microvessel density (MVD), determined by CD34 staining and morphology, was lower in NSCLC samples with high GM3 expression. CD1a+ cells (immature DCs) were more frequent in NSCLC tissues as compared to peritumoral lung tissue, while CD83+ cells (mature DCs) were more frequent in peritumoral lung tissue. CD83+ DCs were less frequent in NSCLC tissues with high GM3 expression.
Only five cases were found to have LPL mass and activity deficiency, all of them thin and having the first episode in childhood. No cases had apolipoprotein CII deficiency. No significant differences were found between the non-deficient LPL cases and the controls in terms of obesity, diabetes, alcohol consumption, drug therapy, gender distribution, evidence of fasting chylomicronaemia, lipid levels, LPL activity and mass, hepatic lipase activity, CII and CIII mass or apo E polymorphisms. However, the SNP S19W of apo A5 tended to be more prevalent in cases than controls (40% vs. 23%, NS).
The study presents association between TLR gene mutations and increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. Novel mutations in TLR genes (TLR1- Ser150Gly and Val220Met; TLR2 - Phe670Leu) were statistically correlated with the hindrance in recognition of MAP legends. This correlation was confirmed subsequently by measuring the expression levels of cytokines (IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-gamma) in the mutant and wild type moDCs (mocyte derived dendritic cells) after challenge with MAP cell lysate or LPS. Further in silico analysis of the TLR1 and TLR4 ectodomains (ECD) revealed the polymorphic nature of the central ECD and irregularities in the central LRR (leucine rich repeat) motifs.
During a project aimed to analyze genes located in the telomeric region of the long arm of the human X chromosome, we have identified a novel transcript family, DDX11L, members of which map to 1pter, 2q13/14.1, 2qter, 3qter, 6pter, 9pter/9qter, 11pter, 12pter, 15qter, 16pter, 17pter, 19pter, 20pter/20qter, Xpter/Xqter and Yqter. Furthermore, we partially sequenced the underrepresented subtelomeres of human chromosomes showing a common evolutionary origin.
Overall, the intervention group gained 2.60 QALYs (260 individuals with an average gain of 0.01 QALYs). The car occupants gained 1.54 QALYs (76 individuals, average of 0.02). Thus, the cost per QALY gained was 16 000 Swedish Crown (SEK) overall and 8 500 SEK for car occupants.
The overall response rate was 63%. More than 40% of physicians had a negative reaction towards obese patients, 56% felt qualified to treat obesity, and 46% felt successful in this realm. The factor analysis revealed 4 factors-Physician Discomfort/Bias, Physician Success/Self Efficacy, Positive Outcome Expectancy, and Negative Outcome Expectancy. Competency and reported percent of patients who lose weight were most strongly associated with the Physician Success/Self Efficacy attitude factor. Greater skill in patient assessment was associated with less Physician Discomfort/Bias. Training characteristics were associated with outcome expectancies with newer physicians reporting more positive treatment expectancies. Pediatric faculty was more positive and psychiatry faculty less negative in their treatment expectancies than internal medicine faculty.
Our results demonstrated that the mice produced more IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and less IL-10, and also exhibited fungal clearance, at the beginning of tumor evolution. With the tumor progression, this picture changed: IL-10 production increased and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha release decreased; furthermore, there was extensive fungal dissemination.
Breakpoints were non-random, with the highest frequency between 65 Mb and 75 Mb, close to a low copy number repeat region (68-71 Mb). There were, surprisingly, few breakpoints close to APC, contrary to expectations were there constraints on tumorigenesis caused by uncovering recessive lethal alleles or if mitotic recombination were mechanistically favoured by a longer residual chromosome arm. The locations of mitotic and meiotic recombination breakpoints were correlated, suggesting that the two types of recombination are influenced by similar processes, whether mutational or selective in origin. Breakpoints were also associated with higher local G+C content. The recombination and gain/deletion breakpoint maps on 5q were not, however, associated, perhaps owing to selective constraints on APC dosage in early colorectal tumours. Since polymorphisms within the region of frequent mitotic recombination on 5q might influence the frequency of LOH, we tested the 68-71 Mb low copy number repeat and nearby tagSNPs, but no associations with colorectal cancer risk were found.
Our reconstruction of the molecular interactions affected by glaucoma revealed multi-domain biological networks controlling activation of ONHAs at the level of intercellular stimuli, intracellular signaling and core effectors. The analysis revealed that synergistic action of the transcription factors AP-1, vitamin D receptor and Nuclear Factor-kappaB in cross-activation of multiple pathways, including inflammatory cytokines, complement, clusterin, ephrins, and multiple metabolic pathways. We found that the products of over two thirds of genes linked to glaucoma by genetic analysis can be functionally interconnected into one epistatic network via experimentally-validated interactions. Finally, we built and analyzed an integrative disease pathology network from a combined set of genes revealed in genetic studies, genes differentially expressed in glaucoma and closely connected genes/proteins in the interactome.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect modifications in transcription levels of the genes for matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), which were derived from previous genome-wide expression analysis. Significant up-regulation of these two genes was found in 10 horses that had completed a race of 90-120 km in a time-course experimental design.
Core autistic symptoms were highly prevalent in all ASD subgroups. Though AD subjects had the most pervasive problems, restrictions in non-verbal communication were common across all three subgroups and, contrary to current DSM criteria, so were verbal communication deficits. Lifetime psychiatric axis I comorbidity was very common, most notably mood and anxiety disorders, but also ADHD and psychotic disorders. The frequency of these diagnoses did not differ between the ASD subgroups or between males and females. Antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse were more common in the PDD NOS group. Of all subjects, few led an independent life and very few had ever had a long-term relationship. Female subjects more often reported having been bullied at school than male subjects.
Overall smoking prevalence for the total sample was 53.6% with significantly higher prevalences among men in slums (59.8%) than non-slums (46.4%). Respondents living in slums reported a significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher prevalence of smoking cigarettes (53.3%) as compared to those living in non-slums (44.6%). A similar pattern was found for bidis (slums = 11.4% and non-slums = 3.2%, P &lt; 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of smoking cigarettes (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.22), bidis (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.58-2.29) and any of the two (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.13-1.34) among men living in slums as compared to those living in non-slums when controlled for age, division, education, marital status, religion, birth place and types of work. Division, education and types of work were the common significant correlates for both cigarette and bidi smoking in slums and non-slums by multivariable logistic regressions. Other significant correlates of smoking cigarettes were marital status (both areas), birth place (slums), and religion (non-slums). Similarly significant factors for smoking bidis were age (both areas), marital status (slums), religion (non-slums), and birth place (both areas).
63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, or SLE were admitted to a ward and diagnosed to have pneumonia/pneumonitis. Using bronchoscopy a total of 6 cases of pulmonary infection associated with HSV-1 in the lower respiratory tract were identified. Among those, 2 cases suggested a causative role of HSV-1 as the sole agent causing pneumonitis that proved clinically responsive to antiviral treatment. In the remaining 4 cases HSV-1 appeared as a bystander of bacterial infection. Maintenance therapy with leflunomide, which inhibits HSV-1 assembly in vitro, was associated with a milder course of pneumonitis in one patient. Detection of HSV-1 was associated with stronger immunosuppressive regimens and vasculitic disease.
Four raters (two paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, two senior physiotherapists) used the CAP scores to analyze, on two different occasions, 11 videotapes containing standardized recordings of motion activity according to the domain CAPMotion Quality These results were compared to a criterion (two raters, well experienced CAP assessors) for validity and for checking for learning effect.Weighted kappa statistics, exact percentage observer agreement (Po), percentage observer agreement including one level difference (Po-1) and amount of scoring scales defined how reliability was to be interpreted. Inter- and intra rater differences were calculated using median and inter quartile ranges (IQR) on item level and mean and limits of agreement on domain level.Inter-rater reliability varied between fair and moderate (kappa) and had a mean agreement of 48/88% (Po/Po-1). Intra -rater reliability varied between moderate to good with a mean agreement of 63/96%. The intra- and inter-rater differences in the present study were generally small both on item (0.00) and domain level (-1.10). There was exact agreement of 51% and Po-1 of 91% of the six items with the criterion. No learning effect was found.
We develop an analytical bifurcation analysis based on the stability and the Routh-Hurwitz theorem for a common negative feedback system and a variety of its variants. We demonstrate that different combinations of the feedback strengths of individual loops give rise to different dynamical behaviours. Moreover, incorporating more negative feedback loops always tend to enhance system stability. We show that two mechanisms, in addition to the lengthening of pathway, can lower the Hill coefficient to a biologically plausible level required for sustained oscillations. These include loops coupling and end-product utilisation. We find that the degradation rates solely affect the threshold Hill coefficient for sustained oscillation, while the synthesis rates have more significant roles in determining the threshold feedback strength. Unbalancing the degradation rates between the system species is found as a way to improve stability.
We have developed a Boolean network-based simulation and analysis software tool, ChemChains, which combines the advantages of the parameter-free nature of logical models while providing the ability for users to interact with their models in a continuous manner, similar to the way laboratory biologists interact with laboratory data. ChemChains allows users to simulate models in an automatic fashion under tens of thousands of different external environments, as well as perform various mutational studies.
37.8% of participants (n=377) reported performing any recommended behaviour change "over the past four days . . . because of swine flu." 4.9% (n=49) had carried out any avoidance behaviour. Controlling for personal details and anxiety, recommended changes were associated with perceptions that swine flu is severe, that the risk of catching it is high risk, that the outbreak will continue for a long time, that the authorities can be trusted, that good information has been provided, that people can control their risk of catching swine flu, and that specific behaviours are effective in reducing the risk. Being uncertain about the outbreak and believing that the outbreak had been exaggerated were associated with a lower likelihood of change. The strongest predictor of behaviour change was ethnicity, with participants from ethnic minority groups being more likely to make recommended changes (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.3) and carry out avoidance behaviours (4.1, 2.0 to 8.4).
People cohabiting with a partner in mid-life (mean age 50.4) were less likely than all other categories (single, separated, or widowed) to show cognitive impairment later in life at ages 65-79. Those widowed or divorced in mid-life and still so at follow-up had three times the risk compared with married or cohabiting people. Those widowed both at mid-life and later life had an odds ratio of 7.67 (1.6 to 40.0) for Alzheimer's disease compared with married or cohabiting people. The highest increased risk for Alzheimer's disease was in carriers of the apolipoprotein E e4 allele who lost their partner before mid-life and were still widowed or divorced at follow-up. The progressive entering of several adjustment variables from mid-life did not alter these associations.
Steady increases in net coverage indicators were observed over the three year study period. Between 2005 and 2007, household ownership of at least one net (untreated or insecticide treated) increased from 44% (2686/6115) to 65% (4006/6198; P&lt;0.001), and ownership of at least one insecticide treated net doubled from 18% (1062/5961) to 36% (2229/6198) in the same period (P&lt;0.001). Among infants under 1 year of age, use of any net increased from 33% (388/1180) to 56% (707/1272; P&lt;0.001) and use of an insecticide treated net increased from 16% (188/1180) to 34% (436/1272; P&lt;0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, household ownership was positively associated with time since programme launch, although this association did not reach statistical significance (P=0.09). Each extra year of programme operation was associated with a 9 percentage point increase in household insecticide treated net ownership (95% confidence interval -1.6 to 20). In 2005, only 7% (78/1115) of nets in households with a child under 1 year of age had been purchased with a voucher; this value increased to 50% (608/1211) in 2007 (P&lt;0.001). In 2007, infants under 1 year in the least poor quintile were more than three times more likely to have used an insecticide treated net than infants in the poorest quintile (54% v 16%; P&lt;0.001).
We present a method to transform such literature-based gene association scores to network prior probabilities, and apply it to learn gene sub-networks for yeast, Escherichia coli and Human organisms. We also investigate the effect of weighting the influence of the prior knowledge. Our findings show that literature-based priors can improve both the number of true regulatory interactions present in the network and the accuracy of expression value prediction on genes, in comparison to a network learnt solely from expression data. Networks learnt with priors also show an improved biological interpretation, with identified subnetworks that coincide with known biological pathways.
We propose a method to estimate the posterior probability that a marker has (no) effect given its test statistic value, also called the local false discovery rate (FDR), in the GWAS. A critical step involves the estimation the parameters of the distribution of the true alternative tests. For this, we derived and implemented the real maximum likelihood function, which turned out to provide us with significantly more accurate estimates than the widely used mixture model likelihood. Actual GWAS data are used to illustrate properties of the posterior probability estimates empirically. In addition to evaluating individual markers, a variety of applications are conceivable. For instance, posterior probability estimates can be used to control the FDR more precisely than Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
We describe the latest implementation of the GenTHREADER method for structure prediction on a genomic scale. The method combines profile-profile alignments with secondary-structure specific gap-penalties, classic pair- and solvation potentials using a linear combination optimized with a regression SVM model. We find this combination significantly improves both detection of useful templates and accuracy of sequence-structure alignments relative to other competitive approaches. We further present a second implementation of the protocol designed for the task of discriminating superfamilies from one another. This method, pDomTHREADER, is the first to incorporate both sequence and structural data directly in this task and improves sensitivity and selectivity over the standard version of pGenTHREADER and three other standard methods for remote homology detection.
A robust regulation design is proposed for a stochastic synthetic gene network to achieve the prescribed steady states under these uncertain factors from the minimax regulation perspective. This minimax regulation design problem can be transformed to an equivalent stochastic game problem. Since it is not easy to solve the robust regulation design problem of synthetic gene networks by non-linear stochastic game method directly, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is proposed to approximate the non-linear synthetic gene network via the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique through the Robust Control Toolbox in Matlab. Finally, an in silico example is given to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed robust gene design method.
We present the extended similarity group (ESG) method, which performs iterative sequence database searches and annotates a query sequence with Gene Ontology terms. Each annotation is assigned with probability based on its relative similarity score with the multiple-level neighbors in the protein similarity graph. We will depict how the statistical framework of ESG improves the prediction accuracy by iteratively taking into account the neighborhood of query protein in the sequence similarity space. ESG outperforms conventional PSI-BLAST and the protein function prediction (PFP) algorithm. It is found that the iterative search is effective in capturing multiple-domains in a query protein, enabling accurately predicting several functions which originate from different domains.
The performance of SOrt-ITEMS has been validated with reads simulating sequences from 454 and Sanger sequencing technologies. In addition, the taxonomic composition of the Sargasso Sea data set has been analyzed using SOrt-ITEMS. SOrt-ITEMS shows improved specificity and accuracy of assignments especially in simulated scenarios, wherein sequences corresponding to the source organism of the reads are absent in the reference database.
The general idea is to encode only the differences between a genome sequence and a reference sequence, using absolute or relative coordinates for the location of the differences. These locations and the corresponding differential variants can be encoded into binary strings using various entropy coding methods, from fixed codes such as Golomb and Elias codes, to variables codes, such as Huffman codes. We demonstrate the approach and various tradeoffs using highly variables human mitochondrial genome sequences as a testbed. With only a partial level of optimization, 3615 genome sequences occupying 56 MB in GenBank are compressed down to only 167 KB, achieving a 345-fold compression rate, using the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence as the reference sequence. Using the consensus sequence as the reference sequence, the data can be stored using only 133 KB, corresponding to a 433-fold level of compression, roughly a 23% improvement. Extensions to nuclear genomes and high-throughput sequencing data are discussed.
In this article, we present an efficient algorithm for performing sub-graph isomorphism queries on a network and show its computational advantage over previous methods. We also present a novel application of this form of topological search which permits analysis of a network's structure at a scale between that of individual functional modules and that of network-wide properties. This analysis provides support for the presence of hierarchical modularity in the PPI network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
We found that nucleosome organization in gene promoters can be well described by autocorrelation transformation. Some promoters show obvious periods in their nucleosome organization, while others have no clear periodicity. The genes with periodic nucleosome organization in promoters tend to be lower expressed than the genes without periodic nucleosome organization. These suggest that regular organization of nucleosomes plays a critical role in gene regulation. To quantitatively associate nucleosome organization and gene expression, we predicted gene expression solely based on nucleosome status and found that nucleosome status accounts for approximately 25% of the observed gene expression variability. Furthermore, we explored the underlying forces that maintain the periodicity in nucleosome organization, namely intrinsic (i.e. DNA sequence) and extrinsic forces (i.e. chromatin remodeling factors). We found that the extrinsic factors play a critical role in maintaining the periodic nucleosome organization.
Results from simulation studies showed that the prediction model by gradient lasso recovers the prognostic genes. Also results from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma datasets and Norway/Stanford breast cancer dataset indicate that our method is very competitive compared with popular existing methods by Park and Hastie and Goeman in its computational time, prediction and selectivity.
In this work, hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) is proposed for combining data from ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip. In HHMM, inference results from individual HMMs in ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip experiments are summarized by a higher level HMM. Simulation studies show the advantage of HHMM when data from both technologies co-exist. Analysis of two well-studied TFs, NRSF and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), also suggests that HHMM yields improved TFBS identification in comparison to analyses using individual data sources or a simple merger of the two.
We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.
We present a new efficient algorithm and its implementation as a software tool to compute all perfect repeats in inputs of up to 500 million nucleotide bases, possibly containing many genomes. Our algorithm is based on a suffix array construction and a novel procedure to extract all perfect repeats in the entire input, that can be arbitrarily distant, and with no bound on the repeat length. We tested the software on the Homo sapiens DNA genome NCBI 36.49. We computed all perfect repeats of at least 40 bases occurring in any two chromosomes with exact matching. We found that each H.sapiens chromosome shares approximately 10% of its full sequence with every other human chromosome, distributed more or less evenly among the chromosome surfaces. We give statistics including a quantification of repeats by diversity, length and number of occurrences. We compared the computed repeats against all biological repeats currently obtainable from Ensembl enlarged with the output of the dust program and all elements identified by TRF and RepeatMasker (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/jherrero/.repeats/all_repeats.txt.bz2). We report novel repeats as well as new occurrences of repeats matching with known biological elements.
We propose here a novel algorithm that integrates semantic similarities (derived from the ontology structure) into the procedure of deriving clusters from the dendrogram constructed during expression-based hierarchical clustering. Our approach can handle the multiple annotations, from different levels of the GO hierarchy, which most genes have. Moreover, it treats annotated and unannotated genes in a uniform manner. Consequently, the clusters obtained by our algorithm are characterized by significantly enriched annotations. In both cross-validation tests and when using an external index such as protein-protein interactions, our algorithm performs better than previous approaches. When applied to human cancer expression data, our algorithm identifies, among others, clusters of genes related to immune response and glucose metabolism. These clusters are also supported by protein-protein interaction data.
Using the Tess program under the no-admixture model to analyse data consisting of several genuine HWLE populations with individuals of pure ancestries leads to highly inaccurate results; Using the Tess program under the admixture model to analyse data consisting of a continuous isolation-by-distance population leads to the inference of spurious HWLE populations whose number and features depend on the parameters used. Results previously reported about the A.thaliana using Tess seem to a large extent to be artefacts of the statistical methodology used. The findings go beyond population clustering models and can be an help to design more efficient algorithms based on graphs.
None of the oral cavity samples were positive for HPV, while in the genital tract, HPV was detected in 17 (57%) of the 30 patients, especially HPVs 6b and 16.
All 33 patients were surgically treated through a neck incision without the need for sternotomy. We did not observe definitive lesions in the inferior laryngeal nerve or definitive hypoparathyroidism. Only 2 patients had recurrent nerve paresis; and 2 patients were re-operated because of a neck hematoma.
fifty EAEP tests were carried out; 70% were classified as type I (normal response) according to Jerger's criteria. Altered EAEP results in at least one ear were classified into types II, III, IV or V according to Jerger. Females accounted for 31.25% of alterations, and males 44.44%, adding up to 36% of all cases.
There was a PES pressure reduction according to the CM after BT injection in all patients. The average pressure in the PES seen through the CM in eight patients before BT injection was 25.36 mmHg, and afterwards it dropped to 14.31 mmHg (p=0.004). There was vocal emission without stress and PES spasm improvement seen through the videolaryngoscopy after BT injection.
During visual analysis we did not find statistically significant differences which would separate the glottic alterations groups.
Three clinical histories are presented, describing two fish bones and one piece of fish cartilage. FB shifting was analyzed in all of them. Migration started in the esophagus in two, one going to the aorta and the other to the neck area. In the other two, migration started in the pharynx, and the FB moved towards the prevertebral fascia and the other externalized in the submandibular region. The mechanisms and the risks posed to the patient, by FB migration, and the way to diagnose them are hereby discussed.
The inflammatory process remained stable, showing its relationship with the surgical procedure and not with the presence of the cellulose blanket. There were no statistical differences in the other parameters.
There was no statistically significant difference between genders and ears. The average values obtained were 2.16, 2.42, 4.37, 60.50 ms; 40.71 to 67.33%; 96.25 to 99.38%; 73.55 to 73.88% and 58.38 to 65.47% respectively for the MSSNV, MSSV, LS, AFT-R, PSI/SSI tests with ipsilateral (PSI/SSIMCI) and contralateral (PSI/SSI/MCC) competitive message, DD and SSW tests.
There was little variation in the mortality coefficient in the years considered for study. The Sertão Mesoregion had the highest number of deaths and Fernando de Noronha island had the highest mortality rate. The patient profile found was: men, between 60-69 years, brown color, married, with low literacy, who died in a hospital setting.
Results show that there was no statistically significant difference for N2 and P3 latency and P3 amplitude as far as gender is concerned, nor correlation with the individual's age. There was a strong correlation of these measures with Fz and Cz electrode positioning.
We tested 625 children. In the first stage, 458 NBs passed and 155 failed. 122 NBs returned to the second stage, and 8 underwent it because they were positive for HL risk factors. 12 NBs (1.9%) were referred for diagnostic investigation. Of the 5 who returned for the BAEP, we observed HL in two NBs.
61% of the participants were female, average age average was 69.53 years. The results associated with tinnitus features were: no-pulsatile 76%, continuous 54%, bilateral 57%, recent 62% and alone 83%;32,5% had emotional disorders, 31.8% had sleep disorders, 22.5% had difficulties concentration and 13.2% had social problems; 39% classified their tinnitus in moderate; 35% had intense tinnitus and 26% considered it a mild one: as to comorbidities: relation with neurotology symptoms and hypertension; as for associations with audiometry findings: descending, sensorineural and symmetrical curves prevailed.
The most frequently found alterations in oral lichen planus were: an increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm relation (93.33%), nucleus membrane thickness (86.67%) and bi-nucleus or multinucleous (86.67%). The Student t test (alpha=5%) revealed a statistically significant difference between the average number of cell alterations in oral lichen planus (5.87+/-1.57) and in epidermoid carcinoma (7.60+/-1.81). As to the types of alterations, the chi-squared test also revealed statistically significant differences among the lesions assessed in relation to the following cell alterations: nuclear excess chromatism, atypical mitoses, cellular pleomorphism and abnormal cell differentiation (p&lt;0.05).
Under the FS, 54% of the nodules were benign, 30% were follicular neoplasms, and 16% were malignant. All cases considered benign and malignant under the FS evaluation were confirmed through the histological 'paraffin' analysis. Since it is not considered a definitive indication for total thyroidectomy, if the follicular neoplasms were classified as 'benign' under the FS, their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and global diagnostic accuracy were 69%, 100%, 100%, 91,5% e 77%, respectively. Among the 42 cases classified as 'follicular neoplasm' under the FNAB, in 1 case the FS conclusion was for papillary carcinoma, in 3 cases as benign (all confirmed through the 'paraffin'); and 38 cases continued as 'follicular pattern', being 29 follicular adenomas and 9 carcinomas through the 'paraffin'.
These measures varied between 17 and 26.5 millimeters.
The difference in signs and symptoms' score between GR and GC was significant. We noticed a significant difference between GR and GC in breathing, chewing and swallowing. We observed a significant association between the score of nasal obstruction and the intensity of breathing and chewing alterations.
Dysphonia had an impact on the quality of life of all patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups - professional users and non-users of their voices; however, considering the groups separately, this correlation was significant only in the group of patients who do not use their voices professionally.
Surgery time was shorter in the group using adrenaline 1:2,000, which also showed less bleeding in all evaluations (objective and subjective - p &lt; 0.0001). Plasmatic levels of epinephrine rose in all groups, more sharply in the 1:2,000 group. There was a trend towards elevation of blood pressure in the groups using adrenaline 1:2,000 and 1:10,000, with a greater occurrence of hypertensive peaks.
All vestibular test parameters were altered when we compared experimental and control groups.
The lesions exhibited a predilection for males with a female-to-male ratio of 1:3.3. Mean age was 57 years old and soft palate was the site affected in 77% of the cases. Pain symptoms were reported by 61.5% of the patients and association with risk factors such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake was seen in 100% and in 46% of the cases, respectively. The lesions showed epithelial dysplasia, where more than 50% were diagnosed as in situ or invasive carcinoma.
Both groups had high rates of hearing loss, especially the descending curve sensorineural type, and there was no statistically significant difference between the groups.
High levels of Der p 1 and Der f 1 mite allergens were found in a large proportion of the sample in most of the environments included in those studies; there were higher levels of pet allergens in cars and school transportation vehicles.
Chronic pain occurred to 96 patients (80%), pain was nociceptive for 48 patients (50%) and 19 patients (20%) had mixed pain. Morphine was relevant in 54 cases but only 27 prescriptions were made. One of the reasons was the fear of some physicians. Only eight prescriptions were respected. Six patients did not respected prescription because of unavailability whereas the remaining mentioned financial reasons as the obstacle. None adverse reaction occurred.
During our study period, we observed 32 cases of childhood ovary tumours that represent 8.16% of all ovarian tumours. The average age of occurring was 10.7 years. Histologically it was germ cell tumours in 40.6% of cases (mature teratomas: 34.4% ; immature teratomas: 3.1% ; yolk sac tumours: 3.1%), sex cord-stromal tumours in 21.8% of cases (granulosa cell tumours: 18.7% ; fibroma: 3.1%) and Burkitt lymphoma in 37.6%.
Significant prognostic variables in univariate analysis were the ASA anaesthetic score, stage T2b, tumour diameter, involvement of the uterine corpus, radiological (N1) and histological (N+) pelvic lymph node involvement and bilateral N+. Tumour volume was not significant. In multivariate analysis stage T2b (HR = 2.5; p = 0.003), N+ (HR = 3; p = 0.003) and bilateral N+ (HR = 6.1; p &lt; 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors. Four prognostic groups according the existence of 0 to 3 prognostic factors showed their overall survivals declining from 97 to 27% (p &lt; 0.0001).
Dexamethasone induced slight, but considerable DNA fragmentation by itself. It effectively protected cells from hydrogen peroxide induced DNA damage, leading to a maximum decrease of about 45% when preincubated on 5 days at 20 microM. alpha-Tocopherol most effectively reduced oxidative DNA fragmentation by about 38% when MOC were pretreated 5 days at 20 microM.
The raise of peripheral temperature was observed after induction of local inflammation or haematoma. Opposite to that, transient decrease of the skin surface temperature was observed after tumour transplantation. Progressive growth of tumour was associated with the raise of the skin surface temperature from the 10th day after tumour inoculation, when the tumours developed supportive neoangiogenic blood supply, as verified by histology.
The staining of MAL in gastric cancer tissues showed that high levels of alpha 2, 3-linked sialic acid residues were closely associated with the invasive depth (P=0.0003) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.0441). In gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines, SGC-7901, the highly metastatic cell line, displayed the most positive reaction with MAL among the selected cell lines. The potential of invasion and migration was confirmed using the assays of adhesion and transwell chamber that SGC-7901 exhibited the high activity of adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) and penetration to Matrigel.
Overall, our results indicate that the GG genotype of SNP309 is significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC (odds ratio, OR=2.60, 95% CI, 1.08-6.28). Interestingly, despite a wide range of confidence interval, there is a trend associating the GG genotype with a high risk of HCC in males (OR=3.31; 95% CI, 0.93-11.82) and in HCV-infected patients (OR=3.7; 95% CI, 0.82-16.45). By contrast, no association between age at diagnosis and MDM2 SNP309 genotypes was observed in HCC patients (P=0.610).
Overall, the OC relative frequency was 67% in PR and 40% and 4% in the NYC general and oral pathology laboratories, respectively (each p&lt;0.001). In PR, the OC relative frequency was highest for males (80%). When OC relative frequencies were stratified by pathology laboratory type (general/oral) and compared across PR and NYC, age/gender-specific OC relative frequencies were always higher in PR; however, differences were consistently statistically significant for males only.
There was no statistically significant difference among medically underserved Latina or non-Latina women in Pap test result and stage of cervical cancer after controlling for age and screening regularity. Rarely/never Pap-tested women were more likely to have 'SIL/ASC' (odds ratio=1.19; 95% confidence interval=1.08, 1.31) compared to women who were screened regularly. Medically underserved 25-39-year-old women were also more likely to be identified with 'SIL/ASC' (odds ratio=1.64; 95% confidence interval=1.50, 1.79) than women 50 and over. Younger were more likely to have low-grade 'HPV/Condylomata, Atypia/CINI/LSIL' (odds ratio=2.48; 95% confidence interval=1.66, 3.72) and high-grade 'CIN II/III/HSIL/CI/Other Cancers' (odds ratio=1.53; 95% confidence interval=1.08, 2.16) than women age 40 and above, similar to rarely/never Pap-tested women.
We did not find protective effects of Hap3 against lung cancer, despite an adequately powered design for this main effect. Homozygous variants of tagSNPs -1738 T&gt;A and -354 G&gt;T, which tag Hap2, showed an increased (but statistically non-significant) risk of lung cancer among all subjects as well as among individuals with low fruit and vegetable intake, compared to homozygous wildtypes for these SNPs. We did not find significant interactions between Hap2 and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables.
The SRRE for all studies that reported results for red meat (included variables labeled 'red meat' or single red meat items, such as beef, pork, or liver) was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.98-1.29; p-value for heterogeneity=0.015), and the SRRE using only data from prospective cohorts was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.91-1.15) with minimal heterogeneity (p=0.741). Similarly, in a meta-analysis of the five studies that simultaneously adjusted for smoking, BMI, and total energy intake, the SRRE for red meat was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.91-1.15). No significant association was observed in the meta-analysis of processed meat consumption (SRRE=1.07; 95% CI: 0.94-1.23), although a significant association was observed when only data from cohort studies were analyzed (SRRE=1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.37).
It was found that significant associations of the NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype (odds ratio, OR: 2.42; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.47-3.99), GSTM1 null genotype (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.11-2.42) and GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotype (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.00-2.95) with increased risk of bladder cancer. Conversely, carriers with at least one CYP2A6*4 allele showed lower risk than the non-carriers (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.79). The adjusted ORs (95% CI) for smokers with NAT2 slow-acetylator, GSTM1 null, GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotype, and variant CYP2A6 genotypes were 2.99 (1.44-6.25), 1.98 (1.13-3.48), 2.66 (1.22-5.81) and 0.41 (0.20-0.86), respectively. Furthermore, NAT2 slow-acetylator, GSTM1 null, and GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotypes were associated with higher tumor grade (P=0.001, 0.022, and 0.036, respectively), and only NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype was associated with higher tumor stage (P=0.007). CYP2A13 was not associated with risk or tumor characteristics.
The mean relative viscosity of Ringer's lactate was 4.19 (+/- 0.49), that of Ringer's lactate with 1.3% albumin was 4.30 (+/- 0.31), and of 20% albumin was 7.32 (+/- 0.71). The relative viscosity of Ringer's lactate and Ringer's lactate with 1.3% albumin were statistically similar, but that of 20% albumin was higher than the Ringer's lactate and Ringer's lactate with 1.3% albumin.
Two hundred and seventeen patient records were analysed; 102 (47%) patients were diabetic and 115 (53%) non-diabetic. The mean age in the two groups was almost similar. Differences noted between the two groups were that there was a higher prevalence of males and cigarette smokers in the non-diabetic group and hypertension among the diabetics. The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in the two groups was not statistically significant. The majority of patients in both groups presented with critical limb ischaemia. Overall, 208 (96%) of the patients had their procedures performed using loco regional anaesthesia. The incidence of superficial wound infection between the two groups was not statistically significant. Deep infection, which necessitated removal of the graft, and cardiovascular complications were significantly higher in the diabetics. Four patients (3.9%) in the diabetic group and only one (0.9%) in the non-diabetic group died.
Four left ventricular geometric patterns were identified: 23 (15.3%) had normal left ventricle geometry, 33 (22%) had concentric remodelling, 37 (24.7%) were found to have eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy occurred in 57 (38%) of the hypertensive individuals. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction occurred more in hypertensives with concentric left ventricular geometric pattern. Increased left ventricular mass index and relative wall thickness were found to be associated with the mitral E-wave, E/A ratio and pulmonary venous flow S-wave in the hypertensives (p &lt; 0.001).
The most presented age group was 60 to 69 years old, with a predomination of females (56.1%). We found dilated left atrium in 26.02% of the study patients and a high statistical correlation between different methods of measurement and calculated volumes of the left atrium.
Four independent predictors associated with a CK &gt; 5 ULN were identified. Statin therapy was protective [odds ratio (OR) 0.096, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.014-0.68, p = 0.019], and a serum creatinine &gt; 180 micromol*l(-1), positive serum troponins and embolectomy and/or fasciotomy were associated with CK elevation (OR 3.32, 95% CI: 1.03-10.7, p = 0.04; OR 5.84, 95% CI: 1.52-22.4, p = 0.01; OR 5.62, 95% CI: 1.14-27.8, p = 0.03 respectively). Statin therapy was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.86, p = 0.028).
Water displacement and ankle circumference had high inter-examiner agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.93, 0.96 right; 0.97, 0.97 left). Agreement was inconsistent for figure-of-eight (0.64, 0.86), moderate for indirect leg volume (0.53, 0.66), and low for clinical assessments at all locations. Agreement was low for the edema testers but varied by the pressure administered. Correlation with the classic, subjective clinical assessment was good for the nurse-performed assessments and patient questionnaire. Ankle circumference and patient questionnaires each took 1 minute to complete. Other tools took &gt;5 minutes to complete.
Ten patients completed the study. The difference between the mean within-subject changes in %HbA1c associated with 6-week periods of fluticasone and the mean changes associated with montelukast therapy was small but statistically significant (mean difference=0.25; P&lt;0.025). Neither fluticasone nor oral montelukast therapy for 6 weeks led to a significantly different mean % HbA1c compared with the relevant baseline (mean differences=0.11 and -0.14, respectively).
Using ER/PR+ and Her2- as a reference, ER/PR-, Her2- had the worst overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.2) and the worst disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-3.0). In ER/PR+, Her2-, chemotherapy conferred significant overall and disease-free survival advantages. Subtype comparison revealed statistically significant differences in outcomes.
In the laparoscopic group 80 anterior resections (including 4 intersphincteric resections and manual colo- anal anastomosis) and 9 abdominal-perineal resections were performed. 33.3% of patients were enrolled in "long-course" neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (partial and complete response rates 88.2% and 11.8%, respectively). Protective lateral ileostomy was performed in 72% of patients. Mean operative time was 254.3+/-38.3 min and mean blood loss was 215+/-180 ml. Conversion rate was 12.7%. Morbidity rate was 39.3% without mortality. The rate of anastomotic leaks was 13.48%, reoperation rate 13.48%, recovery rate 3.1+/-1.4 days and hospital stay 10.4+/-4.6 days. Concerning adequacy of oncologic resection, mean distance of the tumour from the anal verge was 4.3+/-2.2 cm. Nodal sampling of 12.4+/-4.8 were obtained. Six patients (6/89, 6.74%) had a R1 margin: 3 distal and 3 circumferential. Median follow-up was 29 months and local recurrence rate was 5.79%. Four-year cumulative overall survival was 78% and disease-free survival was 63% (Kaplan-Meier method).
All 5 microsatellite markers' status were established in 73 patients (79.3% of the samples). Among them, 7 tumours showed instability in just one marker (low microsatellite instability [MSI-L]) whereas 5 tumours had mutations in 2 or more markers (high microsatellite instability [MSI-H]), for a total 15.4% rate of MSI tumours. All MSI-H tumours were located in the right colon. We could not fi nd any impact from MSI detection on global or disease-free survival.
After initial deterioration, HRQOL scores partially recovered, although significant differences between treatment groups persisted at two years. Worsening of urinary incontinence was especially marked for the radical prostatectomy group (11.45, p=0.005), while deterioration in the urinary irritative/obstructive domain was worse following brachytherapy treatment (4.76, p=0.025). Decline in sexual function was significantly greater for the radical prostatectomy group than for the brachytherapy group (18.74, p&lt;0.001). No significant between-group differences were observed in bowel domain scores.
Between June 1977 and March 2003, 66 patients for whom follow-up was available were diagnosed with localised high-grade extremity osteosarcoma and treated with chemotherapy. The median age was 15 years, with only 3% older than 40 years, and the median follow-up was 100 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 67 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 113 months. The absence of a response to chemotherapy was correlated with a trend toward lower PFS and OS. High serum pre-treatment LDH level was associated in multivariate analyses with a poorer prognosis for both PFS (HR=8.623, 95%CI: 1.71-43.37; p=0.009) and for OS (HR=9.38; 95%CI: 1.73-50.74; p=0.009).
Reaction times in GenA(MBO) were significantly longer than in the other three conditions (ON(MBO), ON(MMO), GenA(MMO)). The distribution of brain activities associated with each condition resembled that reported in previous studies on healthy subjects using similar tasks; a comparison between GenA and ON revealed slight differences located above all in the premotor and prefrontal cortices, particularly as regards GeneA(MBO)&gt;ON(MMO). Furthermore, we found positive correlations between the severity of the motor deficit (as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - UPDRS score) and brain activity, particularly during GenA(MBO), in the pre- and post-central gyri bilaterally, left frontal operculum, left supplementary motor area (SMA) and right superior temporal cortex.
Symptomatic responses to hypoglycaemia occurred at higher blood glucose concentrations in SU-treated than INS-treated patients [3.5 (0.4) vs. 2.6 (0.5) mmol/l SU vs. INS; P = 0.001] or controls [SU vs. CON 3.5 (0.4) vs. 3.0 (0.6) mmol/l; P = 0.05]. They also had a greater increase in symptom scores at hypoglycaemia [13.6 (11.3) vs. 3.6 (6.1) vs. 5.1 (4.3) SU vs. INS vs. CON; P = 0.017]. There were no significant differences in counterregulatory hormone responses or impairment of cognitive function among groups.
Forty-two out of 105 centres exhibited significant seasonality in the incidence of Type 1 diabetes (P &lt; 0.05). The existence of significant seasonal patterns correlated with higher level of incidence and of the average yearly counts. The correlation disappeared after adjustment for latitude. Twenty-eight of those centres had peaks in October to January and 33 had troughs in June to August. Two out of the four centres with significant seasonality in the southern hemisphere demonstrated a different pattern with a peak in July to September and a trough in January to March.
The overall weighted prevalence of diabetes was 9.1%; 502 people (7.5%) had self-reported diabetes (9.0% of men and 6.0% of women); 36 (1.7%) had undiagnosed diabetes (2.6% of men and 0.8% of women). Of cases of diabetes, 18.5% were undiagnosed (22% in men, 12% in women). Significant risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes were male sex, higher body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and triglycerides.
CCC time showed significant correlations with all the neurological parameters, the strongest of which were with Valsalva ratio (rho = -0.64, P &lt; 0.0001), symptoms of DPN (rho = 0.66, P &lt; 0.0001), postural hypotension (rho = 0.54, P = 0.0001) and CTT (rho = -0.54, P = 0.0001). CCC time showed moderate diagnostic accuracy for both CAN and DPN: the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.71 and 0.76, respectively. The diagnostic characteristics of three cut-off values of CCC time, identified by ROC analysis (i.e. 10, 15 and 18 min), were analysed. Compared with 10 min, the 15-min cut-off value provided better specificity (from 27% to 52% and from 31% to 62% for CAN and DPN, respectively) and a better likelihood ratio for negative result (from 0.67 to 0.34 and from 0.58 to 0.33) without lowering sensitivity (from 82% to 82% and from 85% to 80%).
The JADE Risk Engine categorized patients into four risk levels (from low to high): level 1, n = 4520 (6%); level 2, n = 1468 (19.5%); level 3, n = 4476 (59.4%); and level 4, n = 1138 (15.1%). After a median follow-up period of 5.5 years (mean +/- sd 5.4 +/- 2.81 years), 763 (10.1%) died, 1129 (14.9%) developed cardiovascular disease (CVD), 282 (3.7%) developed end-stage renal disease and 1400 (18.6%) had at least one of these events. Compared with risk level 1, levels 2, 3 and 4 were associated with 2.8-, 4.7- and 8.6-fold increased risk of clinical end-points. Risk levels 3 and 4 were, respectively, associated with 2.2- and 3.9-fold increased risk for all-cause death and 4.8- and 12.1-fold increased CVD risks.
Forty patients participated in eight focus groups. Seventy-five of the 85 ICF categories contained in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for DM were identified by the patients. Forty-seven additional categories that are not covered by the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for DM were identified.
Subjects who lost weight were more frequently exposed to anti-IFRx (85.0 vs. 71.5%, P = 0.018) than subjects who maintained or gained weight during follow-up. The 158 subjects exposed to anti-IFRx were older (64.2 +/- 9.4 vs. 60.6 +/- 11.2 years, P = 0.04), had longer duration T2DM (14.5 +/- 9.5 vs. 9.0 +/- 9.4 years, P = 0.001), had greater prevalence of dyslipidaemia (72 vs. 19%, P &lt; 0.0001) hypertension (57.3 vs. 38.1%, P = 0.03) and cardiovascular disease (37.7 vs. 9.5%, P &lt; 0.0001) than subjects not exposed to anti-IFRx. In a logistic regression model for weight change status, anti-IFRx exposure was significantly associated with weight status (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.8, P = 0.02, an association that persisted), even after controlling for age, sex, baseline body mass index, years since diagnosis, OHA therapy and co-morbidities.
All analysable experiments, covering a broad range of blood glucose values, yielded highly accurate data for the complete experimental time with a mean relative absolute difference of 12.8 +/- 6.0% and a predictive residual error sum of squares of 15.6 +/- 6.3 (mean +/- SD). Of all measurement results, 98.2% were in zones A and B of the error grid analysis. The average absolute differences were 1.14 mmol/l for Type 1 and 0.88 mmol/l for Type 2 diabetic patients. Relative absolute differences were 16.0% for Type 1 and 12.6% for Type 2 diabetic patients.
Statistically significant improvements from baseline to week 30 were observed in both treatment groups for DTSQ-s and IWQOL-Lite measures, with significantly greater reduction in perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and greater satisfaction with continuing treatment in the QW group compared with the BID group. Effect sizes for change in DTSQ-s total scores were 0.84 QW, 0.64 BID; for IWQOL-Lite: 0.96 QW, 0.82 BID. Treatment satisfaction and QOL improved significantly between weeks 30 and 52 for those switching from BID to QW. Occurrence of adverse events did not affect patients' improvements in treatment satisfaction and QOL.
Psychometric analyses including Principal Components Analysis and Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient showed that a single satisfaction score (excluding two items scored individually) can be computed for the entire DTSQ-IP, indicating very good internal consistency reliability (0.92). The DTSQ-IP detected considerable dissatisfaction with meal choice and timing (13.7% of in-patients would never have chosen similar meals at home), and with in-patient hypoglycaemia (35.3% felt that their blood glucose was too low most of the time). In-patients on surgical wards, women, and those long established on insulin were significantly more dissatisfied, particularly with competence of hospital staff. Patients who administered their own insulin were not significantly less dissatisfied overall, but were so with the choice of meals (P = 0.005). Multiple regression analysis produced a model accounting for 8.2% of variability in DTSQ-IP (r = 0.29; P = 0.0058) and 21.7% of variability in LOS (r = 0.46; P = 0.0001).
Plasma levels of both apoC-II and apoC-III were increased in Type 2 diabetic patients. The clinical conditions associated with an increase of plasma apoC-II and apoC-III were abdominal obesity, body mass index, poor glycaemic control and lack of insulin treatment. However, when multivariate analysis was used, plasma apoCs levels correlated with triglyceride levels only. The apoC-III/apoC-II ratio was similar in the Type 2 diabetic and control subjects.
A significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) was identified between the median risk assessments of the two groups. The zero level of assessed risk was upward shifted in the patient group by 0.8 mmol/l and indicated the patients' view of risk increased.
Degradation of ionic liquids in this system was quite effective. Increasing the H(2)O(2) concentration from 100 to 400 mM improved ionic liquid degradation from 57-84% to 87-100% after 60 min reaction time. Resistance to degradation was weaker, the shorter the alkyl chain.
DM was rapidly absorbed onto the surface of the algal cells where it was hydrolyzed to diclofop (DC). Further degradation to 4-(2, 4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol (DP) occurred in the cells. However, only a minor amount of DC was degraded to DP under the same conditions when DC was initially added to the algal culture. When C. vulgaris was exposed to these compounds for 96 h, the determined EC(50) showed that DC was about ten times less toxic than DM (EC(50) = 0.42 mg/L) and that DP (EC(50) = 0.20 mg/L) was the most toxic.
Without the addition of Cu, the adsorption of lambda-CHT and CPM on Black soil is greater than that on Red soil, while the adsorption of lambda-CHT on both soils is significantly stronger than that of CPM. As the soil Cu concentration increased from 19 (or 18; background) to 1,600 mg.kg(-1), the adsorption coefficient (K (d)) of lambda-CHT decreased from 12.2 to 5.9 L.kg(-1) for Red soil, and from 26.1 to 16.8 L.kg(-1) for Black soil, whereas the CPM adsorption coefficient in both soils decreased nearly by 100% (K (d) decreased from 9.4 to 0.2 L.kg(-1) for Red soil and from 16.2 to 0.5 L.kg(-1) for Black soil).
XRD analyses evidenced the presence of sulfates (gypsum and thenardite), calcite, Ca-oxalates (whewellite and weddellite), and quartz forming part of the patinas. Although these mineral phases can be found in both color-type patinas, whewellite and thenardite are more common in the ochre-orange patinas. The results obtained were validated by the FTIR measurements. It has been observed, when thenardite is present, that gypsum occurs as traces. Thenardite is in most of the cases associated with whewellite and mainly occurs in the internal parts of the glass. In contrast, weddellite is limited to the absence of thenardite and whewellite and to the external parts of the stained glass. Quartz is present in all the patinas independent of their location and color. Calcite also occurs in many samples. It appears in both color-type patinas and, in some cases, is associated to the presence of weddellite but not to whewellite and/or thenardite.
Experimental set-ups were compiled systematically under the aspect whether they might be usable for testing the infochemical effect of single chemicals in standardized quantifying laboratory experiments. For an appropriate ecotoxicological assessment of the infochemical effect, experimental studies of many disciplines, such as molecular biology, neurobiology, physiology, chemical ecology, and population dynamics, should be evaluated in detail before a decision can be made which test system, respectively which test battery, might be suited best. The test systems presented here are based on the knowledge of the genetic sequences for olfactory receptors, binding studies of odorants, signal transmission, and reactions of the receivers on the level of the organisms or the populations. The following basic approaches are conceivable to identify the role of an infochemical: binding studies to the odorant-binding protein or to the odorant receptor binding protein (e.g., by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies), measurement of electrical signals of the receptor cells in the tissue (e.g., electroolfactograms, electroantennograms), registration of phenotypic changes (e.g., observation under the microscope), behavioral tests (e.g., in situ online biomonitoring, use of T-shaped olfactometers, tests of avoidance responses), measurement of population changes (e.g., cell density or turbidity measurements), and multispecies tests with observation of community structure and community function. The main focus of this study is on aquatic organisms.
Efficiency of reactors was almost the same even though the one emitting higher wavelength had doubled optical power compared to the other. Therefore, the effect of wavelength was evident and the radiation emitted at 269 nm was more powerful. Also, the impact of background was studied and noticed to have only slight deteriorating effect. In the 5-min experiment, the bacterial reduction of three to four log colony-forming units (CFU) per cubic centimeter was achieved, in all cases.
On the basis of irrigation water quality standards, the irrigation potentials of paper mill, fermentation (breweries and distilleries), and sugar factory effluents were recognized. In a soil-based approach, the compatibility of effluent with soil type was marked with A (preferred) and B (moderately preferred) classes and, compiling their recurring presence, the unanimous preference for paper mill effluent followed by rubber goods manufacturing industries/marine shrimp processing units, fermentation, and sugar mills was noted. Usability of these was also evident from a groundwater exploitation status-based approach.
The obtained data show that (1) naturally poor elements (Cu, Ni, Si, and SO(4) (2-)) dominantly influence the lake's water quality; (2) they are transported from the anthropogenic sources to the study lake through the atmospheric pathway; (3) mainly the contents of Cu, Ni, Sr, and Ca have influenced the sediment quality since the 1950s, corresponding to the industrial movement; and (4) Cu, Ni, and Sr originate from an anthropogenic source (smelter), and Ca originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources.
The studied individuals (n = 104) were sub-adult (30-70 cm, 71 ind.) and adult fish (&gt;70 cm, 33 ind.). Weight (W) (204.1 +/- 97.9 g, total biomass = 21,229.7 g) and total length (TL) (63.1 +/- 10.1 cm, range 29.5-89.0 cm) presented a significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlation. Two-way ANOVA (n = 81) showed that TL and W had significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among seasons, being higher in D1 than in D2 and R, respectively. Moreover, season vs. month interaction were detected for the variables length and weight. For the variable weight was detected significant difference for the factor month (p &lt; 0.05). It suggests that the fish enter the estuary at the end of the rainy season and increase in length and weight during the time they spend in the estuary. Fish from this estuary are shown to be fit for human consumption (125.3 +/- 61.9 microgHg-T kg(-1) w.wt.; n = 104). Fish mercury contents increased with size and weight. Correlations between TL and Hg-T (r = 0.37286) and between W and Hg-T (r = 0.38212) were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Dryer months showed higher mercury concentrations in fish (D1 773.4 +/- 207.5 microgHg-T kg(-1) d.wt., n = 27; D2 370.1 +/- 78.8 microgHg-T kg(-1) d.wt., n = 27; R 331.2 +/- 138.5 microgHg-T kg(-1) d.wt., n = 27). The variable mercury concentration showed differences in relation to the factor season (p &lt; 0.05), where fish captured during the first dry season showed the highest concentration of mercury. The correlation between Hg-T and rainfall (Rf) showed a negative correlation (r = -0.56; p &lt; 0.05).
Highly elevated concentrations of PCDD/Fs were found at many sites in coastal areas and concentrations were also slightly elevated in some offshore areas. Homologue profiles varied substantially amongst samples from coastal sites, while those from offshore and other pristine sediments were relatively similar. The offshore sediments showed different profiles from those observed in the deposition samples. Sediment levels of PCDD/Fs were not generally significantly correlated to organic carbon levels, except in some pristine areas. Comparison of data obtained in this and previous studies suggest that both their levels and profiles are similar today to those observed 20 years ago in coastal and offshore areas. The only detected trend is that their levels appear to have decreased slightly in the offshore area of the Bothnian Sea.
The confusion matrix-based field GPS points were applied to the habitat analysis process, and it was found that the habitat map was 81.3% precise. Then, with the current habitat map, we found that the mixed forest currently used by the monkeys is only a very small fraction (2.65%) of the overall potential habitat of the population, while the dark conifer forest is 4.09%.
The GM plant may affect the environment directly or indirectly by dispersal of the transgene. Magnitude of the transgene dispersal will depend on the GM crop, the agricultural practise and the environment of the release site. From case-to-case these three factors provide a variability that is reflected in widely different likelihoods of transgene dispersal and fitness of introgressed plants. In the present review, this is illustrated through a bunch of examples mostly from our own research on oilseed rape, Brassica napus. In the Brassica cases, the variability affected all five main steps in the process of gene dispersal. The modelling performed suggests that in Brassica, differences in fitness among plant genome classes could be a dominant factor in the establishment and survival of introgressed populations.
Sixty of 61 planned patients received treatment (30 per dosing group); 26 completed the study. Overall, the CBR was 53% (95% exact CI, 40-66): eight patients (13%) achieved objective PRs; 24 (40%) achieved SD 24 weeks. Median PFS was 34 weeks (95% CI, 24-49); median OS was 107 weeks (95% CI, 72 - not yet calculable). Most adverse events (AEs) were of grade 1 or 2 in severity, and were manageable through dose modification or standard interventions. No new AEs were apparent compared with the approved intermittent dosing schedule. Antitumour activity and safety were generally similar with morning and evening dosing. Continuous daily sunitinib dosing achieved and sustained effective drug concentrations without additional accumulation across cycles. Decreases from baseline in plasma levels of soluble KIT after 20 and 24 weeks of dosing correlated with longer OS.
FTS prevents liver nodule formation and reduces foci expressing the tumour marker GSTp. FTS abrogates DEN-induced Ras membrane activity, increases Tunel positive cells in transformed, GSTp-expressing hepatocytes, up-regulates caspase 3 and 8 activity, induces Fas, Fas ligand and JNK phosphorylation that occurs independently of TNFalpha and Trail. Cytochrome C release, Bax, Bcl2, Bcl-xl, Ki67 and nuclear cyclin D expression is not affected by FTS.
At 3-years follow-up, grade 3/4 toxicity was recorded for xerostomia (44%), hoarseness (14.3%), altered taste (6.1%) and oropharyngeal pain (1.9%). Factor analysis indicated that questionnaire division according to anatomical sub-site was reasonable. Cronbach's alpha was 0.851 (95% CI: 0.820-0.883) indicating high reliability. Good compliance was obtained with all questions except for the 'weight loss' item. A satisfaction survey showed that the questionnaire was clear and concise. Teeth and mandible sections have been removed. Dietary change due to xerostomia has been incorporated in line with CTCAEs. LENT-SOMA scoring of analgesic needs and dysphagia not described in CTCAEs were found useful and have been retained.
Significant improvements in most domains and worsening of nausea were reported by patients and parents from diagnosis to Weeks 12 and 23. Symptom distress decreased from diagnosis to Weeks 12 and 23 in 81% and 64% of patients, respectively. There were no sex- and few age-related differences in scores. Scores from patients and parents achieved good agreement.
R(+)XK469 competitively inhibited S-warfarin hydroxylation. The K(i) values of R(+)XK469 were estimated to be 959+/-426 microM for human liver microsomes and to be 377+/-92 microM for CYP2C9.
With the exception of mismatch repair deficiency, these molecular markers showed divergent and inconsistent results on their prognostic and/or predictive value. This underscores the complexity of the role of these markers.
Active ROM of shoulder flexion (P&lt;0.001), abduction (P&lt;0.001), and external rotation (P=0.005), wrist flexion (P=0.025), and extension (P&lt;0.01) of the plegic upper extremity improved significantly after CIMT. There were significant improvements in functional ability scale (P&lt;0.05 for all parameters) and performance time results of 13 (P&lt;0.05 for all parameters) out of 15 parameters of WMFT. Significant improvements were observed in quality-ability scores of every subunit of each activity (P&lt;0.05 for all parameters) and performance time scores (P&lt;0.05 for all parameters) of KFET.
Of 2091 titles and abstracts identified, full text versions of only three were obtained. The remaining 2 088 were excluded, largely on the basis of not including dysarthria, being diagnostic or descriptive papers, and for concerning adults rather than children. All obtained articles were excluded due to including populations without ABI, adults with dysarthria, or inappropriate design. Thus, no studies met inclusion criteria.
The MMAS values of the participants increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) particularly in the first three months and between the fifth and sixth month post-stroke. The WHOQoLBREF scores showed inconsistent increase and decrease over the study period; this was however not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). No significant correlation was observed between MMAS and WHOQoLBREF scores (P&gt;0.05) however, both the psychological and environmental domains of the overall health item of the QoL showed significant correlation (P&lt;0.05) with motor function at the 1st month post-stroke.
In the ectoneural division of the nervous system, both antisera recognize the content of secretory vacuoles in the apical cytoplasm of the radial glia-like cells of the neuroepithelium and in the flattened glial cells of the non-neural epineural roof epithelium. The secreted immunopositive material seems to form a thin layer covering the cell apices. There is no accumulation of the immunoreactive material on the apical surface of the hyponeural neuroepithelium or the hyponeural roof epithelium. Besides labelling the supporting cells and flattened glial cells of the epineural roof epithelium, both anti-RS antisera reveal a previously unknown putative glial cell type within the neural parenchyma of the holothurian nervous system.
BoNT-A injections allowed a statistically significant improvement in KSC of both lower limbs (p=0.004). Moreover, the unaffected side KSC reached normal values after BoNT-A injections.
Leg strength and locomotor kinematics - in particular local instability - correlated with functional gait performance in controls. Conversely, reduced functional gait performance in the PN group was primarily mediated by impaired standing balance control.
Antero-posterior shear was significantly lower in the deformity group (p&lt;0.05). The lateral forefeet of the patients, however, experienced slightly higher shear loads (p&gt;0.05).
The robotic surgery programs at UNC Hospital and Florida Hospital are growing steadily since the inception of the programs in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Since 2005 there have also been numerous publications detailing the effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of the robot.
A therapeutic response was achieved in 43.8% of patients with a combination of two antihistamines, 68.4% of patients with three antihistamines and 76.9% of patients with high dosage desloratadine. The average reduction in pruritus was 57.5% (two antihistamines), 67.4% (three antihistamines) and 89% (desloratadine). Adverse drug effects were observed rarely.
Two RCTs were included for the review of clinical effectiveness and safety. The only RCTs identified that evaluated different durations of clopidogrel treatments were conducted in patients with stroke, PAD, STEMI or PCI. Two small RCTs and one uncontrolled retrospective cohort study were identified for the review of rebound after thienopyridine withdrawal in patients with medically-treated NSTE-ACS. On broadening the criteria, five RCTs, two observational cohorts, nine case series and 33 case reports were identified in patients post-PCI, and two case series and two case reports were identified in patients with stroke, PAD or STEMI. The CURE trial reported that the proportion of patients experiencing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke was lower in the clopidogrel group at 30 days [relative risk (RR) 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.92] and from 30 days to 12 months (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.70-0.95). Clopidogrel seems to be effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events in patients with NSTE-ACS at intermediate and high risk of ischaemic events, and appears to increase the risk of bleeding when compared with aspirin in patients with intermediate risk of ischaemic events. In terms of the cost-effectiveness of alternative durations of clopidogrel, the updated model reinforced the conclusions from the earlier analysis, i.e. a policy of 12 months of clopidogrel for patients with NSTE-ACS appears to be cost-effective in both 'average' patients and higher-risk patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of 12 months' duration ranged from 13,380 pounds to 20,661 pounds per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across the different scenarios. For lower-risk patients, treatment beyond 3 months does not appear to be cost-effective. The ICER of 12 months' treatment with clopidogrel varied between 49,436 pounds and 58,691 pounds per QALY. Estimates of expected value of perfect information (EVPI) were higher for the combined analysis and for analysis of high-risk patients alone (between 48.69 million pounds and 108.4 million pounds at a threshold of 30,000 pounds per QALY). At a threshold of 20,000 pounds-30,000 pounds per QALY, total EVPI ranged between 3.27 million pounds and 20.38 million pounds in the lower-risk group.
ProMMP-2 levels were significantly higher in adjacent normal tissues. Active MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were higher in malignant breast tissues. Activation ratios of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly higher in malignant breast tissues and in patients with lymph node metastasis. ProMMP-2, active MMP-2, and active MMP-9 could significantly discriminate between malignant and adjacent normal breast tissues. The MMP-2 activation ratio showed significant discriminatory efficacy between patients with and without lymph node metastasis and significant association with increased risk of lymph node metastasis in node-negative patients.
In the study population, the data indicated a high prevalence of HPV 16. However, during the course of study (1999 - 2003), four (66.6%) dysplasia cases with HPV 18, three (21.4%) dysplasia cases with HPV 16, and none with low-risk HPV6/11, turned into invasive cancer, within one year.
The results of the study indicated that 52% of the sample performed BSE. Approximately 35% of those who performed BSE reported that they acquired information regarding BSE during their work experience. A significant relationship was found between higher levels of work experience and BSE practice. Except for age, no significant relation was found between the sociodemographic factors and BSE practice. The sample showed a strong belief in the breast lump being the cause of breast cancer and it had a significant correlation with BSE practice.
Twenty-three of the 28 patients had inguinal LND. In group 1, of 13 patients, 12 were alive, with no recurrence of disease at a mean follow-up of 37 months (8-84) months. In group 2, only two patients were alive and disease-free, at a mean follow-up of 58 months (33-84 months). The five-year cancer-specific survival rates for early and delayed LND were 91 and 13%, respectively, (p = 0.007).
Colorectal patients, 22.64% (12 of 53), presented with mutations in K-ras constituting 13 missense mutations out of which 11 were G--&gt;A transition, one G--&gt;C transversion, and one G--&gt;T transversion. 61.5% percent of the mutations occurred in codon 12 and 38.5% in codon 13. One tumor contained missense mutations in both codons. K-ras mutations were significantly associated with advanced Dukes' stage (P &lt; 0.05) and positive lymph node status (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover Codon 12 K-ras mutations were associated with mucinous histotype (P &lt; 0.05). Comparison of the mutation profile with other high-risk areas reflected both mucinous histotype differences and similarities indicating coexposure to a unique set of risk factors.
Mean age (SD) at the time of diagnosis was 50 (15). Fifty-nine percent of ovarian, 33.9 and 47.7% of uterine corpus and uterine cervix malignant patients were premenopausal. About 90% of all were nonsmokers and 82.7% were multiparae. Various types of gynecologic malignancies included ovarian (55.5%), uterine corpus (24.9%), and uterine cervical cancers (19.6%) were diagnosed. In tumors of the uterine corpus and uterus cervix, the most frequent stage of diagnosis was stage IIA.
Of the 98 OS lesions, 85 (86.8%) involved the skeleton, the youngest patient was 6 and the oldest 60 years old; 13 lesions (13.2%) involved the jaws (seven mandibular and six maxillary) and the youngest and oldest patients were 15 and 50 years-old, respectively. Non-gnathic OS was more prevalent between the ages of 11 and 20 years (avg. 15 years) and was common in the distal femur and proximal tibia, presenting most frequently with pain and swelling. OS of the jaws, however, presented more than 10 years later than non-gnathic OS, being more prevalent between the ages of 20 and 30 years (avg. 27 years). OS of the jaws most frequently involved the mandibular body and the posterior maxillary alveolar ridge, presenting frequently with pain, swelling and loosening of teeth. Two patients with gnathic OS died during the 10-year follow-up period (15.3%).
Twelve benign lesions were seen in 12 patients. In our series, cysts predominated, with three aneurysmal bone cysts and five simple bone cysts. The other benign tumors were: one fibrous dysplasia, one vascular hamartoma, one osteoblastoma, and one chondromyxoid fibroma. The bone cysts were treated by curettage, with or without bone grafting, except for one large aneurysmal bone cyst, which was treated by excision of the calcaneum. The postoperative function in this patient was good, with modified footwear.
At mean follow-up of 15 months, 74% of the eyes had a favorable anatomical outcome with single procedure. The visual status was favorable in 63% . The lens remained clear in all the eyes at the last follow-up, and the media clarity was maintained in 87%. Intraoperative complications included vitreous hemorrhage, pre-retinal hemorrhage and retinal break formation.
Out of 5897 suspected cases of microbial keratitis 3563 (60.4%) were culture-proven (bacterial--1849, 51.9%; fungal--1360, 38.2%; Acanthamoeba--86, 2.4%; mixed--268, 7.5%). Patients with agriculture-based activities were at 1.33 times (CI 1.16-1.51) greater risk of developing microbial keratitis and patients with ocular trauma were 5.33 times (CI 6.41-6.44) more likely to develop microbial keratitis. Potassium hydroxide with calcofluor white was most sensitive for detecting fungi (90.6%) and Acanthamoeba (84.0%) in corneal scrapings, however, Gram stain had a low sensitivity of 56.6% in detection of bacteria. Majority of the bacterial infections were caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis (42.3%) and Fusarium species (36.6%) was the leading cause of fungal infections. A significantly larger number of patients (691/1360, 50.8%) with fungal keratitis required surgical intervention compared to bacterial (799/1849, 43.2%) and Acanthamoeba (15/86, 17.4%) keratitis. Corneal healed scar was achieved in 75.5%, 64.8%, and 90.0% of patients with bacterial, fungal, and Acanthamoeba keratitis respectively.
Of total 61 patients 36 were females and 36 had convergent squint, mean age 9.8 years. The correlation of BFP testing with IEAD was good for esotropia and exotropia. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of central, steady, maintained (CSM) grading was 93%, 78%, 79%, and 93% respectively. Sensitivity and negative predictive values were higher in children aged four to nine years and anisometropia&gt; 1 diopter. The correlation between IEAD and lower grades of BFP testing was poor.
This study included 93 strabismic-children aged 4-16 years of which 52 were females. Forty-one had esodeviation and 52 had exodeviation. Seventy per cent parents were extremely distressed due to squint, 65% were extremely distressed due to people's remarks, 65% were extremely worried, 55% children were extremely distressed due to people's remarks, 57% children were severely ostracized, 38% had severe difficulty in communication and 50% had difficulty to cope; 64% parents were not advised a corrective surgery. The difference between families from rural and urban areas, or whether a male child was affected or a female child or for an esodeviation or an exodeviation was statistically not significant. The questionnaire had a good internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.71).
CLW showed no significant change in the tear ascorbic acid levels (0.4 +/- 0.26 mM) compared to the control subjects (0.61 +/- 0.59 mM). The amount of ascorbic acid in tears did not correlate with the TAC or the total protein of the tears. The mean TAC in CLW was 0.69 +/- 0.16 mM, with a total protein of 1.35 +/- 0.46 mg/ml while in controls it was 0.7 +/- 0.18 mM and 1.21 +/- 0.47 mg/ml respectively.
Our series comprised 350 patients suffering from DM. The duration of diabetes was &gt; or =15 years in 101 (29%) patients. Physician was treating 108 DM patients with insulin. The prevalence of DR was 55% (95% CI 49.6-60.1). The proportions of background diabetic retinopathy (BDR), preproliferative diabetic retinopathy (PPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema were 20%, 13%, 17% and 22% respectively. The prevalence of blindness among DM patients was 16%. The prevalence of cataract and glaucoma was 34.3% and 8.6%. Duration of DM was the predictor of DR. One-fifth of the patients had sight-threatening DR and needed laser treatment.
Only 79 (37.6%) children out of 210 had received vitamin A-first dose supplement. Further analysis of 79 children was carried out with regard to selected variables like religion, gender, birth order, place of birth, immunization status and literacy of mother. These analyses showed that 71 (89.9%) were Hindu and eight (10.1%) were non-Hindu ( P = 0.04). Nearly 44 (55.7%) males and 35 (44.3%) females had received vitamin A ( P = 0.74). The proportion of children born in a health institution who received first dose (57%) of vitamin A supplementation was significantly higher than of those who were born at home (43%) ( P 0.001). Similarly, higher proportion of children with birth order-one (48.1%) in comparison to birth order-three or above (26.6%) received vitamin A ( P 0.001). Thirty children though fully immunized for vaccine-preventable disease up to the age-of-one year had not received vitamin A-first dose supplement, suggesting that an opportunity had been missed. The association between receipt of vitamin A by the child and literacy status of mother was found to be significant ( P 0.001).
Specimens from 13 patients yielded TRA-8-induced IC50 values. Of these specimens, 15% were found to be sensitive to TRA-8-induced cytotoxicity at IC50 doses less than 500 ng/mL. Specimens from 13 patients underwent combination treatment with TRA-8 and carboplatin/paclitaxel. Of these specimens, 77% exhibited additive cytotoxicity in comparison with those treated with either agent alone, whereas 15% exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity. Immunohistochemical analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling and cleaved caspase 3 staining demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis with the combination treatment.
Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme protein overexpression was found in 13.9% of the tumors. Platinum resistance was found in 75% of the tumors with positive ERCC1 protein expression compared with 27% among the patients with negative tumor staining for ERCC1 (P = 0.0013). These findings translated into a significant difference in progression-free survival in both univariate (P = 0.0012) and in multivariate analysis (P = 0.006).
Five (11%) cases of occult neoplasia were found in 45 patients. This included 3 cases of micro-invasive serous carcinoma of the fallopian tube, 1 case of in situ carcinoma in the fallopian tube and 1 case of metastatic breast cancer in the ovary. All cases of primary neoplasia were in the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube.
Twenty-six patients were enrolled, and 24 patients were eligible for assessment. The response rate was 83.3% (95% CI, 62.6%-95.3%; ). The median progression-free survival was 25 months. The median overall survival had not been reached. Incidences of grade (G) 3/4 hematological toxicities were absolute neutrophil count, 96%; hemoglobin, 29%; and thrombocytopenia, 16%. Nonhematological toxicities included G2 liver function, 4%; G3 sensory neuropathy, 8%; and G3 myalgia and arthralgia, 4%.
From 1997 to 2006, 15 patients with PSC were histologically reviewed in our institution. Five of these patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four patients had ovarian PSC, and 1 had peritoneal PSC. Four patients were surgically treated during initial management and another patient at the time of recurrence. All of them underwent complete cytoreductive surgery followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy in 2 patients and by conventional adjuvant chemotherapy in 1. After a median follow-up of 42 months, 4 of them remain disease-free.
Twenty-four patients were identified. Patients with multiple brain lesions (n = 16) had a shorter median time to diagnosis of BMD than patients with single lesions (n = 8; 22.5 vs 39 months). Radiation therapy was included in the treatment of BMD for 19 patients (78%). Fourteen patients received whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) only (survival, 6 months [range, 1-51 months]). Three patients received a combination of gamma knife radiosurgery and WBRT (survival, 20 months [range, 17-67 months]), and 1 patient received gamma knife radiosurgery alone (survival, 10 months). Four patients underwent craniotomy with 3 receiving postoperative WBRT (survival, 8.5 months [range, 2-97 months]). Two patients elected for palliative care only. The median survival from the diagnosis of BMD was 8.5 months (range, 1-97 months) with a 42% 1-year survival and 16% 2-year survival. Patients with single lesions had a significantly longer survival than patients with multiple lesions (17 months [range, 3-97 months] vs 6 months [range, 3-67 months], respectively).
Patients were divided into 2 groups: those younger than 70 years (group 1: 84 women, 73%) and those 70 years or older (group 2: 31 women, 27%). Although, as expected, elderly women had more major comorbidities, the rate of perioperative complications was similar between the 2 groups. In a logistic regression model, only chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, and past abdominal surgery correlated with a higher rate of perioperative complications. None of the cohort patients died during the perioperative period. The long-term disease-specific survival was significantly poorer for the older group.
Histological evaluation revealed that 34 patients had no invasion, 97 had less than 50% MI, and 60 had greater than 50% MI. On MRI assessment, 135 patients had correct diagnoses, and the accuracy was 70.7%. Regarding the diagnosis of greater than 50% MI depth, the accuracy, the sensitivity, and the specificity of the MRI assessment were 83.2%, 75.0%, and 85.7%, respectively. Seventeen patients were overestimated, and 15 patients were underestimated by the MRI assessment. On intraoperative gross assessment, 162 patients had correct diagnoses, 8 patients were overestimated, and the remaining 21 patients were underestimated. The accuracy of the gross assessment was 84.8%, the sensitivity was 65.0%, and the specificity was 93.9%. The preoperative grading accuracy was 71.8% (125/174). A discrepancy between preoperative and postoperative grades was more frequent in a low-grade tumor. The incidence of underdiagnosis was significantly higher in patients with a grade 3 (G3) tumor than in those with a G1 or G2 tumor in both assessments.
The expression of HIF-1alpha increased in fL HIF-1alpha but not in dn HIF-1alpha SiHa cells. Consistently, the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes such as VEGF, CXCR4, and HGTD-P increased in fL HIF-1alpha-transfected SiHa cells but decreased in dn HIF-1alpha-transfected SiHa cells. The UCC cells transfected with fL HIF-1alpha had increased cellular proliferation and migration. However, the inhibition of HIF-1alpha through dn HIF-1alpha attenuated cell proliferation and migration under both normoxia and hypoxia.
There were 206 eligible patients. The mean potential follow-up was 4.4 years. At 5 years, for all patients, overall survival rate was 59%. For all outcome measures apart from local failure, for which adenocarcinoma histology was the most powerful adverse prognostic factor (HR, 4.29; P &lt; 0.0001), lymph node status on PET was the dominant unifactor and multifactor prognostic factor. Corpus involvement on MRI was significantly associated with nodal involvement on PET but of MRI-derived parameters only tumor volume has prognostic value, limited to time to failure and nodal failure.
Overall, HPV prevalence was 93.5% in CC, 92.6% in HSIL, and 63.4% in LSIL. Human papillomavirus 16 was the most predominant HPV type in all cervical lesions, detected in 83.1% of CC, 77.8% of HSIL, and 33.8% of LSIL. Human papillomavirus 45 was the second most predominant HPV type in CC (16.9%) and HSIL (11.1%). Human papillomavirus 33 was the second most predominant HPV type in LSIL (8.5%). Human papillomavirus 18, equal with HPV 45, was the second most common type in Mongolian CC (15.6%), whereas in Han Chinese specimens, no HPV 18 was found.
Twenty-eight patients with squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled onto this trial. Twenty-five patients were evaluable. There were no objective responses, with 4 (16%) patients achieving stable disease; only 1 patient had a progression-free survival of 6 months (4%) or more. The 1-sided 90% confidence interval for response was 0.0% to 8.8%. The 2-sided 90% confidence interval for the proportion of patients surviving progression-free for at least 6 months is 0.2% to 17.6%. Erlotinib was well tolerated, with the most common drug-related adverse events being gastrointestinal toxicities, fatigue, and rash.
: Altogether, 131 (7.0%), 90 (4.8%), and 39 (2.1%) cases progressed to SIL, CIN1+, and CIN2+, respectively, progression times being equal in the NIS (11.9, 16.8, and 19.6 months) and LAMS (13.6, 14.1, and 15.4 months) cohorts (P = 0.931, P = 0.335, and P = 0.535). The 2 most powerful end-point markers of disease progression to CIN2+ were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions based on Papanicolaou test results at 6-month (odds ratio [OR] = 47.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3-128.7) and 12-month (OR = 21.5; 95% CI, 5.1-90.8) follow-up visits, with longitudinal positive and negative predictive values of 42.1% and 98.0% (6 months) and 33.3% and 97.7% (12 months). Of the virological end points, more than 6 months of persistent high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was the most powerful predictor of progression to CIN1+ (OR = 18.6; 95% CI, 2.5-136.5), with longitudinal positive and negative predictive values of 10.3% and 99.4%, respectively. No additional benefit was obtained using more than 12 months of persistent HR-HPV end point.
All of 43 patients underwent surgery. Of the 43 patients, 17 (39.5%) showed a complete response, 22 (51.2%) had a partial response to cisplatin-paclitaxel, making the overall response rate 90.7%; the remaining 4 patients (9.3%) had a stable disease. A down-staging response was seen in 72.1% (31/43) of patients showing a response. After surgery, patients received adjuvant therapy according to their pathological findings. Among the 43 patients, 37 were followed up. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the overall 2- and 5-year survival rates were 94.5% and 89.2%, respectively. Initial stage, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, differentiation, depth of invasion after chemotherapy, and metastasis were significantly correlated with survival. Differences in TA4, tumor size, and stage before and after chemotherapy were also significantly correlated with survival. In contrast, initial tumor size, carcinoembryonic antigen concentration, cell type, and lymphovascular invasion did not correlate significantly with survival rate.
Disseminated tumor cells were detected in 19% of BM aspirates from patients with gynecological malignancies. Incidences of DTC in ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer were 25%, 16%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. For patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer, no correlation with established clinicopathological factors was observed. In case of cervical cancer, BM positivity was correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, tumor size, and nodal involvement. Bone marrow positivity of ovarian cancer patients was correlated with significantly shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.035). For other tumor entities, no association between BM status and clinical outcome could be observed.
Of 157 women included in the study, 127 filled out the questionnaire. Overall, QoL score assessed with the FACT questionnaire did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The FACT subscales assessing physical, functional, emotional, and social well-being did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, whereas the FACT-Cx subscales assessing disease-related symptoms in group 2 patients showed a significantly worse score (72 vs 66; P = 0.03). Evaluating singularly the 15 items of the Cx subscales assessing disease-related symptoms, we did not find any significant difference between the 2 groups, but only Cx1 ("I am bothered by discharge or bleeding from my vagina") was significantly worse in group 2 patients. At univariate analysis, we found that NSRH and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) impact negatively on the FACT-Cx subscales regarding pelvic visceral function. However, at multivariate analysis, only adjuvant RT impact negatively.
Ninety patients with pelvic exenteration were included. R0 resection was achieved in 61 patients (67.8%), R1 in 20 patients (22.2%), and R2 in 9 patients (10.0%). Sixty-four patients had a rectal resection, all less than 7 cm from the anal verge. Forty-two of them had a rectal anastomosis; in 23 cases, with a protective colostomy. The other 22 patients had a terminal colostomy. Fifty-three patients had an ileal anastomosis for bladder reconstruction by ileal conduit, and 29 patients had an ileo-ascendostomy for an ileocecal pouch.Twenty-three patients (25.6%) needed surgical intervention for complications; anastomotic dehiscence being most frequent with 7 cases (7.8%). Three leakages appeared in ileal anastomoses (3/53, 5.7%) and 4 in rectal anastomoses (4/42, 9.5%). Although not significantly, the risk of symptomatic leakage was lower for patients with a protective colostomy (1/23, 4.3%) than for those without (3/19, 15.7%). We found no correlation between the preceding radiotherapy or chemotherapy and the frequency of breakdown of rectal anastomosis.
The overall conversion rate was 1.7% (2/117). Four patients had vessel injuries, 3 of which were treated laparoscopically. One patient had a common iliac vein laceration that could not be controlled laparoscopically after failing to deal with the injured branch of common iliac vein. Cystotomy occurred in 5 patients. One case of stage IIa with a bladder laceration longer than 3 cm was converted to laparotomy during the early stages of the learning curve. The remaining 4 were managed laparoscopically. Postoperative complications occurred in 38.5% (n = 45) of the patients, including 38 patients with urinary retention who exhibited complete resolution within 6 months by intermittent training and catheterization, 4 with lymphocyst who underwent conservation treatment, 1 with ureteral fistula that was treated by cystoscopic placement of double-J ureteral stents, 1 with mild adynamic bowel obstruction who received conservative management, and 1 with vesicovaginal fistula that was closed by conservative treatment.
Three hundred two colorectal anastomoses were realized with a protective stoma in 59 (19.5%) of cases and a stoma closure in 76.5% (51). The rate of functional anastomosis was 96% (290/302). Complications occurred in 26.9% (82/305) of the patients, with a fistula in 25 (8.2%). The reintervention rate was 8.8% (27/305). The median length of hospitalization was 15 days. The absence of a macroscopic residual disease was obtained in 58% (173/303) of cases. A residual disease that was 1 cm or smaller was observed in 73 cases (24%) and 2 cm or smaller observed in 36 (11.9%). Postoperative chemotherapy was started with a median time of 32 days.Postoperative death occurred in 1 patient (0.33%). The survival rates were 62.7% and 27.6% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. With a multivariate analysis, the 2 significant prognostic factors were residual disease and time of surgery (P &lt; 0.0001).
The mean number of exenterations performed during the last 5 years was comparable in both countries. Consistently, (central) recurrent cervical cancer or persistent tumor after chemoradiation is the main indication. Before exenteration, positron emission tomography-computed tomography is mostly performed in the United States, whereas magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging tool in Germany. Staging is more often done surgically in the United States (61%) compared with Germany (32%). None of the US institutions recommend an exenteration for patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IVA in contrast to 43% in Germany. In the case of fistula to the bladder and/or rectum, exenteration was recommended only by 29% and 61% in US and German clinics, respectively. In Germany, interdisciplinarity with general surgeons, urologists, plastic surgeons, and radio-oncologists is more common. There is consensus to apply adjuvant therapy after exenteration in patients with positive margins and/or positive lymph nodes. However, adjuvant therapy is more frequently recommended in Germany (93%) than in the United States (74%).
Fourteen out of 442 patients were identified as having a "prophylactic" stent inserted. The mean age of this series of 14 women was 66.6 years. Seven women had ultraradical surgery requiring bowel resection and/or resection of tumor from the bladder. Nine women had a stent inserted because of the presence of a hydroureter, 3 for ureteric stricture and 2 to protect a flimsy or fragile ureter after ureteric dissection and tumor debulking. There were no ureteric complications during the post-operative period. This resulted in 9 (64%) women achieving either complete or optimal cytoreduction of their tumor bulk. Optimal/complete cytoreduction in all stage III/IV cases during this period was 88%.
We evaluated the performance of the system on 5 patients (A-E). For patients A and B the computerized system initiated VNS in response to seizures; for patients C and D the system initiated VNS in response to epileptiform discharges; and for patient E neither seizures nor epileptiform discharges were observed during the evaluation period. During the 81 hour clinical test of the system on patient A, the computerized system detected 5/5 seizures and initiated VNS within 5 seconds of the appearance of ictal discharges in the EEG; VNS did not seem to alter the electrographic or behavioral characteristics of the seizures in this case. During the same testing session the computerized system initiated false stimulations at the rate of 1 false stimulus every 2.5 hours while the subject was at rest and not ambulating. During the 26 hour clinical test of the system on patient B, the computerized system detected 1/1 seizures and initiated VNS within 16 seconds of the appearance of ictal discharges; VNS did not alter the electrographic duration of the seizure but decreased anxiety and increased awareness during the post-seizure recovery phase. During the same testing session the computerized system did not declare any false detections.
There was no difference in the time to complete the 21-km run (high-GI vs. low-GI vs. control: 91.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 91.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 92.9 +/- 2.0 min, n.s.). There were no differences in total CHO and fat oxidation throughout the trials, despite differences in preexercise blood glucose, serum insulin, and serum free-fatty-acid concentrations.
TAS concentration (55.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 42.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 37.4 +/- 1.2 micromol/L, p &lt; .001), protein concentration (5.68 +/- 0.36 vs. 5.40 +/- 0.18 vs. 4.01 +/- 0.16 mg/ml, p &lt; .01), and AChE activity (0.89 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.03 DeltaOD/min x mg protein, p &lt; .001) were significantly reduced, whereas Na+,K+-ATPase (6.00 +/- 0.36 vs. 10.44 +/- 1.04 vs. 11.90 +/- 1.21 micromol phosphorus inorganic/hr x mg protein, p &lt; .001) and Mg2+-ATPase activity (7.20 +/- 0.65 vs. 10.88 +/- 1.08 vs. 11.55 +/- 1.22 mmol phosphorus inorganic/hr x mg protein, p &lt; .001) were statistically significantly increased after 2 and 3 hr of forced exercise. Post-L-cys administration, AChE activity was decreased (0.90 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.02 DeltaOD/min x mg protein, p &lt; .001) and remained unaltered (0.64 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.04 DeltaOD/min x mg protein, p &gt; .05) 2 and 3 hr postexercise (0.47 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.02 DeltaOD/min x mg protein, p &gt; .05). Na+,K+-ATPase was decreased and remained unchanged (1.85 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.19 mumol phosphorus inorganic/hr x mg protein, p &gt; .05) 2 and 3 hr postswimming (1.91 +/- 0.19 vs. 2.06 +/- 0.17 mumol phosphorus inorganic/hr x mg protein, p &gt; .05). Mg2+-ATPase activity was similar with L-cys supplementation pre- vs. postswimming.
Stent expansion was significantly less in the SB than in the MV (87.1 +/- 20.4% vs. 97.0 +/- 29.1%, p = 0.007). The SB ostium was the most frequent site of post-procedural MSA. At the SB ostium, follow-up minimum lumen area (MLA) correlated with post-procedural MSA (r = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of neointimal area was higher at the SB ostium than at the MV proximal, MV distal, and SB distal stent (23.8 +/- 18.9% vs. 13.3 +/- 17.3%, 15.4 +/- 20.5%, and 12.5 +/- 17.2%, p &lt; 0.001). The optimal threshold of post-procedural MSA to predict follow-up MLA &gt; or =4 mm(2) at the SB ostium was 4.83 mm(2), yielding an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.80 to 0.95).
One-year event-free survival for patients randomized to R-PCI was 81.5%, compared with 64.1% for repeat thrombolysis and 67.5% for conservative therapy (overall p = 0.004). Adjusted hazard ratio was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28 to 0.71; p = 0.0008) for R-PCI versus repeat thrombolysis and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.83; p = 0.007) for R-PCI versus conservative therapy. Adjusted hazard ratio for longer-term (median 4.4 years) overall mortality for R-PCI versus repeat thrombolysis was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.75; p = 0.004) and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.23 to 0.79; p = 0.006) for R-PCI versus conservative therapy. There was no difference in either analysis between repeat thrombolysis and conservative strategies.
Circulating CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes increased in AMI patients, peaking on days 3 and 5 after onset, respectively. Importantly, the peak levels of CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes, but not those of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes, were significantly negatively associated with the extent of myocardial salvage. We also found that the peak levels of CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes, but not those of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes, were negatively correlated with recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction 6 months after infarction.
Abnormal T-U waves (6.2 +/- 0.9 mm) directly preceded TdP in 34 of 35 LQTS patients and were larger than T-wave amplitude (2.8 +/- 0.2 mm) in control patients and larger than the largest T-U-wave in LQTS without TdP (4.7 +/- 0.8 mm). The TdP-initiating beat emerged from a T-U-wave in 27 of 35 LQTS patients and in none of 40 control patients. The QRS duration of the first TdP beat (175 +/- 12 ms) was longer than in control PVCs (145 +/- 4 ms) and in PVCs in LQTS patients not related to TdP (138 +/- 22 ms). The QRS angle was less steep before TdP than in other PVCs (all p &lt; 0.05).
During follow-up (5.4 +/- 2.2 years), 78 patients had at least 1 cardiac event, including 29 cardiac deaths. Abnormal perfusion (n = 126) was associated with a higher incidence of MACE (p &lt; 0.001) and cardiac death (p &lt; 0.05). In patients with normal perfusion, abnormal CFR was independently associated with a higher annual event rate over 3 years compared with normal CFR for MACE (1.4% vs. 6.3%; p &lt; 0.05) and cardiac death (0.5% vs. 3.1%; p &lt; 0.05). In abnormal perfusion, CFR remained predictive throughout the 10-year follow-up (p &lt; 0.001).
The median age at HT was 12.4 years. Primary diagnosis included single ventricle (36%), d-transposition of the great arteries (12%), right ventricular outflow tract lesions (10%), l-transposition of the great arteries (8%), ventricular/atrial septal defects (8%), left ventricular outflow obstruction (8%), and other (18%). Ninety-three percent of patients had at least 1 operation before HT. Survival at 3 months post-HT was significantly worse in CHD patients versus children with cardiomyopathy, but not adults with cardiomyopathy (86%, 94%, and 91%, respectively). There was no difference in conditional 3-month survival among the 3 groups. Five-year survival was 80%. Risk factors for early mortality were older recipient age, older donors with longer ischemic times, and pre-HT Fontan operations. Predicted survival in Fontan patients was lower (77% and 70% at 1 and 5 years) versus non-Fontan patients (88% and 81% at 1 and 5 years). Risk factors for constant phase mortality included younger recipient age, higher transpulmonary gradient, cytomegalovirus mismatch at HT, and earlier classical Glenn operation.
There were no significant baseline differences between the groups in terms of LV diameter, ejection fraction (27% vs. 28%), infarct territory, or time from infarction. However, control patients had smaller total low-voltage area &lt; or =1.5 mv (30% of surface area vs. 55%, p &lt; 0.001); smaller very low-voltage area &lt;0.5 mv (7.3% vs. 29%, p &lt; 0.001); higher mean voltage of low-voltage zones; fewer fractionated, isolated, and very late potentials with lower density of these scar-related electrograms per unit low-voltage area; and less SMVT inducibility. Potential conducting channels within dense scar and adjacent to the mitral annulus were more frequent in SMVT patients.
We observed that treatment with apigenin rendered the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, treatment of TC-1 tumor cells with apigenin was found to enhance apoptotic tumor cell death in vitro in a dose-dependant manner. We showed that TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with apigenin combined with E7-HSP70 DNA generate highest frequency of primary and memory E7-specific CD8+ T cells, leading to potent therapeutic anti-tumor effects against E7-expressing tumors.
A significant but small fraction of the progeny from parents with reduced mars activity showed gynandromorphy and non-disjunction. Results of cytological analysis revealed that the decrease in chromosome fidelity was a result of delayed polymerization of the mitotic spindle, which led to asynchronous chromosome segregation in embryos that had reduced mars activity. By removing one copy of tousled-like kinase (tlk) from flies with reduced mars activity, chromosome fidelity was further reduced. This was indicated by an increased in the non-disjunction rate and more severe asynchrony. However, the morphology of the mitotic spindles in the embryos at metaphase where both gene activities were reduced was similar to that in mars embryos. Furthermore, tlk overexpression did not affect the morphology of the mitotic spindles and the cellular localization of Mars protein.
Unpublished trials make up 8.8% of all included trials in our sample. Thirty-eight percent of the "unpublished" trials have in fact been published. Allocation concealment was "unclear" or not adequate in 54.3% and 61.3% reported blinding. In 47.2% reported withdrawal rates were &gt;20%. Trials that were eventually published had larger mean population sizes (P-value, 0.02). Of the reported sponsors, 87.3% were drug companies. Methodological quality and publication bias are mentioned in half of the reviews and explored in a third. Quality ratings did not have consequences for pooling, because 82.8% was included in the forest plots.
Trials were cited from 0 to 632 times (median 23 times). Trials were cited more often when results were statistically significant than when they were not (median=41 vs. 17 times, P&lt;0.001), and when impact factors were higher (10.2 more citations per impact factor point, P&lt;0.001). Patch trials were cited more often than gum trials (median=29 vs. 17 times, P=0.001), and trials funded by the pharmaceutical industry were cited more often than other trials (median=28 vs. 16.5 times, P=0.001). Trials with statistically significant results were published in journals with higher impact factors than trials with nonsignificant results (median impact factor=2.80 vs. 1.81, P=0.011).
In general, updating meta-analyses caused 2- to 5-fold inflation of the type I error rates, which exceeded the inflation caused by publication bias. As a rule of thumb, the results of a meta-analysis are robust up to 5, 10, 15, or 22 updates, if the P-value multiplied by 4, 6, 8, or 10 remains below the desired significance level.
Review questions and selection criteria varied; there were both focused and broad reviews of prognostic factors. A quarter of reviews did not clearly define search strategies. The number of potential citations identified ranged from 15 to 4,458 and the number of included prognosis studies ranged from 3 to 32 (of 162 distinct citations included across reviews). Seventy percent of reviews assessed quality of included studies, but assessed only a median of four of six potential biases. All reviews reported associations based on statistical significance; they used various strategies for syntheses. Only a small number of important prognostic factors were consistently reported: older age, poor general health, increased psychological or psychosocial stress, poor relations with colleagues, physically heavy work, worse baseline functional disability, sciatica, and the presence of compensation. We found discrepancies across reviews: differences in some selection criteria influenced studies included, and various approaches to data interpretation influenced review conclusions about evidence for specific prognostic factors.
The validity of our conclusions for the superiority of fluoride toothpaste as indicated from the initial network analysis using Bayesian methods was challenged when we adjusted for possible confounders. The network was dominated by studies comparing placebo with toothpaste, which were older and had been carried out in populations with higher baseline risk than studies involving other fluoride modalities.
One distinct disability domain was identified. The 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with the full-item bank (r=0.99). The item bank and the HAQ-II scales covered a similar estimated scoring range. In terms of reliability, 95% of OA-DISABILITY reliability estimates were over 0.83 vs. 0.60 for the HAQ-II. Except at the highest scores, the 10-item OA-DISABILITY-CAT demonstrated superior precision to the HAQ-II.
SEs for NNT(t) and MERT were derived. The corresponding CVs are particularly useful, because they decompose the variability of NNT(t) and MERT into the uncertainty in their components (the values of target and adverse events, and the adverse event risk [AER]). The precision required for these components to formulate treatment recommendations is, thereby, highlighted. These ideas were illustrated with data concerning warfarin treatment for atrial fibrillation.
For P&lt;0.05, the final model with continuous variables, containing five predictors, disagreed on three predictors with both categorization strategies. For P&lt;0.157, the model with continuous variables, containing six predictors, disagreed on three predictors with the model containing stratified continuous variables and on six predictors compared with the model with dichotomized variables. The models in which the variables were kept continuous performed best. There was no clear difference in performance between categorization before and after the selection procedure.
For each of the five variables (interview length, meals/snacks, meal components, items, kilocalories), naïve and adjusted equivalence tests rejected that observation-status groups were different, indicating that school-meal observations did not influence children's 24-hour dietary recalls. There was a target-period effect on length (P&lt;0.0001) (longer for prior-24-hour recalls), a school year effect on length (P=0.0002) (longer for third year), and a target period-interview time interaction on items (P=0.0110) and kilocalories (P=0.0047) (both smaller for previous-day recalls in the afternoon than prior-24-hour recalls in the afternoon and previous-day recalls in the evening), indicating that variables were sufficiently sensitive and psychometrically reliable.
When RD is estimated from relative measures, the counterintuitive result occurred in 2 of 10 instances. This discordance of interpretation is because of the logarithmic transformation that makes CIs of relative measures asymmetric around their point estimates.
We categorized the solutions into four main groups. The first group includes methods that impute or adjust for missing data on the reference standard. The second group consists of methods that correct estimates of accuracy obtained with an imperfect reference standard. In the third group a reference standard is constructed by combining multiple test results through a predefined rule, based on a consensus procedure, or through statistical modeling. In the fourth group, the diagnostic accuracy paradigm is abandoned in favor of validation studies that relate index test results to relevant clinical data, such as history, future clinical events, and response to therapy.
Introduction of the required author contribution forms by the four leading general medical journals did not result in a drop in the rate of increasing authors per article per year, or in the number of authors per article compared with the control. Overall, there was a trend of an increasing number of authors listed per article.
Factor analysis identified two plausible attributes. Experts rated the importance of ADDQoL and additional items, described attributes from item sets and suggested severity levels. Three pilot rounds (n1=52, n2=65, n3=111) tested versions of a CS, containing five attributes with severity levels that were modified using RA and expert input. The final attributes were Physical Ability and Energy, Relationships, Mood and Feelings, Enjoyment of Diet, and Satisfaction with Management of Diabetes. The validation survey (n=396) results indicated satisfactory Rasch fit statistics, reliability, and severity scaling, whereas correspondence of responses to the CS with included measures suggested validity.
When men and women were considered together, the multivariate test comparing attachment scores by depressive group was statistically significant at p &lt; .05. Between-subjects testing indicated that atypical depression was associated with significantly lower secure attachment scores, with a trend toward higher anxious-ambivalent attachment scores, than was melancholia. When women were analyzed separately, the multivariate test was statistically significant at p &lt; .01, with both secure and anxious-ambivalent attachment scores differing significantly across depressive groups.
Regardless of acupuncture assignment or symptom pattern at entry, all patients experienced improvement over the course of study participation. There was evidence that acupuncture treatment did target the symptom dimension of interest (mood elevation in Study I, depression in Study II). There were few negative side effects and no attrition directly associated with adjunctive acupuncture.
Patient performance was significantly lower than that of the healthy comparison subjects on all neurocognitive variables (p &lt; .001). Most, but not all, neurocognitive measures were significantly correlated with the patients' functional disability shown 6 months after admission to the study, including self-care management, vocational outcome, family contact, and social functioning. Results suggest that processing speed has a significant influence in these relationships.
Anxiety disorder patients as a group reported poorer sleep quality and endorsed a larger number of different types of situations (e.g., surprise, embarrassment) associated with cataplectic events. Among anxious patients, 33.3% (11 of 33) endorsed events specific for classic cataplexy, as opposed to 9.1% (3 of 33) of healthy volunteers (chi(2) = 5.80, p = .016).
Augmentation with atypical antipsychotics reduced mean +/- SD Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total scores in SSRI-refractory OCD patients (at initial assessment = 29.3 +/- 9.9, after 1 year = 19.3 +/- 6.8). However, compared to SSRI responders (at initial assessment = 25.8 +/- 11.4, after 1 year = 13.7 +/- 4.6), total YBOCS scores in those who required atypical antipsychotic augmentation were initially higher, and they remained at higher levels than those of SRI responders after 1 year of the treatments.
Altogether, 20.6% of veterans with MDD received antipsychotic medications, and 43% of those who did received them at the higher doses recommended for schizophrenia. GEE models showed that younger age, male gender, psychiatric comorbidities, duration of diagnosed MDD, and more intensive mental health service use were all associated with greater likelihood of receiving antipsychotics and with less likelihood of receiving them at conventional antipsychotic doses.
Reported clinical manifestations of psychiatric illness in premutation carriers include an apparently significant rate of cognitive, mood, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders. Fragile X premutation-associated conditions are part of the clinical differential diagnosis of several psychiatric syndromes, particularly in pedigrees with known fragile X syndrome cases.
Of the 421 patients enrolled, 44 were started on placebo and were later randomly assigned to citalopram treatment. There were data available for 34 subjects who took placebo for at least 14 days. In this group, there was a 60% reduction in irritability and apathy scores, no effect on scores for delusions, and a clinically insignificant drop in scores for hallucinations.
At day 42, last-observation-carried-forward endpoint, treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant improvement compared to placebo on the BPRSd (least squares mean +/- SE = -8.9 +/- 1.3 vs. -4.2 +/- 1.4; p = .012), as well as on all secondary efficacy measures, including the PANSS total score (-14.1 +/- 2.1 vs. -5.5 +/- 2.2; p = .004) and the PANSS positive (-4.3 +/- 0.7 vs. -1.7 +/- 0.7; p = .006), negative (-2.9 +/- 0.5 vs. -1.3 +/- 0.5; p = .025), and general psychopathology (-7.0 +/- 1.1 vs. -2.7 +/- 1.2; p = .0061) subscales. Significant improvement was seen as early as day 3, based on BPRSd, PANSS, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness assessments. Treatment with lurasidone was generally well tolerated and was not associated with adverse changes in metabolic or electrocardiogram parameters. There were no clinically significant differences between lurasidone and placebo in objective measures of extrapyramidal symptoms.
At 4 months, the strength measured by 1 repetition maximum for chest press increased by a mean (95% CI) of 4.0 kg (0.8 to 7.2; p = .014) in the strength training group versus the relaxation group, and maximal oxygen uptake increased by 2.7 mL/kg/min (1.2 to 4.3; p = .001) in the aerobic group versus the relaxation group. At 4 months, the mean change in HAM-D(17) score was -1.3 (-3.7 to 1.2; p = .3) and 0.4 (-2.0 to 2.9; p = .3) for the strength and aerobic groups versus the relaxation group. At 12 months, the mean differences in HAM-D(17) score were -0.2 (-2.7 to 2.3; p = .8) and 0.6 (-1.9 to 3.1; p = .6) for the strength and aerobic groups versus the relaxation group. At 12 months, the mean differences in absence from work were -12.1% (-21.1% to -3.1%; p = .009) and -2.7% (-11.7% to 6.2%; p = .5) for the strength and aerobic groups versus the relaxation group. No statistically significant effect on cognitive abilities was found.
The 6-marker genotype combinations defined 4 groups of patients with distinct probabilities of response. More than 75% of iloperidone-treated patients in the group with the optimal genotype combinations showed a 20% or greater improvement, compared with 37% for patients with other genotypes. These patients had a significant response by the first week of treatment, which was earlier than for patients with other genotype combinations. The odds of responding to iloperidone treatment with at least 20% improvement ranged from 2.4 to 3.6 for patients with 1 of the 6 favorable single-marker genotypes. The odds increased to 9.5 or greater for patients with the most favorable 6-marker combinations. The difference in PANSS-T score improvement observed between the genotype groups was also seen for the positive, negative, and general psychopathology PANSS subscales. The relationship between treatment efficacy and genotype combinations was not observed for patients treated with ziprasidone.
One hundred eighteen patients (57.8%) were men. The mean (SD) age was 44.39 (10.4) years. The incidence of induced depression during the 48 weeks of antiviral treatment was 73 (42%). Low self-directedness dimension (HR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.446 to 0.890, p = .009), baseline subclinical depression levels (HR = 1.113, 95% CI = 1.023 to 1.22, p = .013), and history of mood disorders (HR = 0.372, 95% CI = 0.220 to 0.629, p &lt;.001) were independent predictive factors for induced depression during PegIFN and RBV treatment. Other predictive personality TCI-R subscales were enlightened second nature (HR = 2.939, 95% CI = 1.423 to 6.071, p = .004), fatigability (HR = 0.421, 95% CI = 0.237 to 0.749, p = .01), and disorderliness (HR = 0.449, 95% CI = 0.248 to 0.815, p = .008).
The clinical group endorsed a higher number of symptoms than the nonclinical group, both cross-sectionally and across time. In both the clinical and nonclinical groups, the clusters of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal were interrelated at any given point in time and across 20 years. In both groups, avoidance was found to be a particularly stable symptom cluster over time. Finally, hyperarousal levels 1 year after the war were found to play an important role in both groups, as they predicted future avoidance and intrusion symptoms.
Almost all adverse events (98%) were mild to moderate in severity. The mean +/- SD reduction in MRS score at week 55 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) was -23.5 +/- 1.5 (p &lt;.0001) from a baseline of 29.4. CGI-S score decreased by 2.32 +/- 0.25 at week 55 (LOCF, p &lt;.0001) from a baseline of 5.0. MRS and CGI-S reductions were comparable across the subpopulations. The overall MRS responder rate was 86%; subpopulation responder rates were 88% (manic), 79% (mixed), 84% (psychotic), and 88% (nonpsychotic). Long-term improvement within subpopulations was comparable to the overall study population.
The combined risks for suicide were found to be 1.43 (95% CI = 1.23 to 1.66), 1.29 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.50), and 1.25 (95% CI = 1.08 to 1.45) in the first, second, and third week, respectively, after suicides of entertainment celebrities, while adjusting for secular trends, seasonality, economic situation, and temporal autocorrelation. The same-gender and same-method specific increases suggest that as people identify more with the celebrity, their risk for suicide rises. A medium-term rise in suicides up to 24 weeks after the incidents of celebrity suicide is also evident.
No treatment effect on GSK-3 activity or CSF-based biomarker concentrations (P &gt; .05) was observed. Lithium treatment did not lead to change in global cognitive performance as measured by the ADAS-Cog subscale (P = .11) or in depressive symptoms.
As compared with baseline, overall recession at six months was reduced from 2.35 +/- 0.35 mm to 1.98 +/- 0.55 mm (p&lt;0.001) in the PT group and from 2.26 +/- 0.31 mm to 1.90 +/- 0.45 mm (p&lt;0.001) in the MT group. The data showed 40% (power) and 38% (manual) of all recession sites improved by at least 0.5 mm while 51% and 54% remained unchanged. Eight percent and 7% recessions increased over time. Differences between groups were not statistically significant at either timepoint.
The mean SBS in Groups 1 through 4 were 11.562+/-3.148, 8.060+/-1.781, 8.830+/-1.554, and 3.074+/-0.784 (MPa), respectively. There were significant differences in the SBS between Group 1 with other groups (P&lt;0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between Groups 2 and 3, but the SBS of both of them were significantly higher than that of Group 4 (P&lt;0.05).
The application of SEP produced the lowest Ra values. No significant difference was detected between the BS values of polished and rough surfaces. No correlation was observed between Ra and BS values. Even though etching enamel with the SEP resulted in a surface with less roughness, similar BS values were observed for both self-etching and etch-and-rinse techniques.
The results revealed statistically significant differences between the polymer burs and carbon steel burs with respect to caries removal efficacy (p&lt;0.001) and the time taken for caries removal (p&lt;0.001). No statistically significant results were obtained regarding patients' perception of the treatment and longevity of the restorations.
The average size of the FLSB to bind against the canal walls first at the working length was approximately two ISO sizes larger than the FKFB (P&lt;0.001).
Twenty-five children (eight PLBW and 17 NBW) were caries free, and the mean+/-SD dmft was 2.5+/-0.3 in PLBW and 2.2+/-0.4 in NBW children (p&gt;0.05). The length of feeding in PLBW children was lower than the NBW group (p&gt;0.05).
The results showed a significantly higher prevalence of caries among asthmatic patients as compared to the matched control group as well as a positive correlation between the duration of asthma and the caries indices.
Prevalence of premolar rotation was found to be 80% in the study group followed by canine rotation (20%), taurodontism (26.6%), infraocclusion of premolars (25.5%), impacted mandibular canine (11.1%), and peg lateral (7.7%). Forty-nine (54.4%) palatally impacted, 37 (41.1%) labially impacted, and 4 (4.4%) centrally impacted canines were also observed. Of the 250 subjects in the control group 78.8% presented with premolar rotation. Maxillary canine transmigration, infraocclusion of premolars, anomalies of maxillary lateral incisors, and taurodontism showed significant associations with palatally impacted canines (P&lt;0.05).
A total of 765 mothers (75.5%) reported systemic signs and symptoms in their children. Fever (51.8%), diarrhea (12.5%), and vomiting (2.9%) were the most prevalent symptoms and signs reported. Teething problems were reported by 60% of mothers from a high socioeconomic class, as well as 76.7% and 77.9% from middle and low socioeconomic classes, respectively. Interestingly, 65.5% of mothers believed teething should be accompanied with systemic signs and symptoms such as fever (42.1%), diarrhea (13.9%), and vomiting (0.6%). No significant difference was noted between breastfeeding status, gender of the child, and reported systemic signs and symptoms noticed by the mothers.
RT leads to alterations in the dentition, saliva, oral microflora, and diet of patients. Consequently, irradiated patients are at increased risk for the development of a rapid, rampant carious process known as radiation caries. Motivation of patients, adequate plaque control, stimulation of salivary flow, fluoride use, and nutritional orientation are essential to reduce the incidence of radiation caries and ultimately improve the quality of life for HNC patients.
Our results showed that the expression level of PDCD4 was inversely correlated to the metastatic potential of HCC cells. After transfection with the PDCD4 gene, HCC cell proliferation rate was significantly decreased, cell apoptosis rate was significantly increased, the expression of MTA1 gene, HCC cell migration and Matrigel invasion were also remarkably inhibited.
Among these GEM sensitivity-related genes, dCK alone showed a significant correlation with GEM efficacy. Eight of 12 patients in the effective group had high dCK expression, whereas 16 of 23 patients in non-effective group had low dCK expressions (P = 0.0398).
The answer rate was 77.5%. Seventy-six per cent of participants encountered monitoring criteria for psychiatric disturbance. Rate of psychological morbidity in between study cluster was much higher than Iranian general population, Iranian non-sued general practitioners, interns and medical students. There was, however, minimal dysfunction of work, public or family life. The survey form to estimate the doctor's realization of lawful risk displayed that doctors yet misconceive medico-legal risk. Doctors being sued or having legal protests against them depict the process as an exceedingly demanding event.
The number of participants who were able to complete the knot (n = 14 text v. n = 18 video, p = 0.49) and the average time needed for completion (479 s text v.494 s video, p = 0.38) were not statistically different in the two groups. However, time to review the material (407 s text v. 258 s video, p &lt; 0.001), number of attempts at the task (15 text v. 5 video had n&gt;2 attempts, p = 0.01), and number of those who expressed understanding when they could not complete the task (35% text v. 59% video, p = 0.047) were statistically different.
We collected all patient data for demographics, operating time, estimated blood loss, histologic findings, lymph node count, analgesic-free postoperative day, length of stay, and intraoperative and early postoperative complications. Mean (SD) patient age was 58.3 (11.5) years (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.7-60.9). Body mass index was 25.2 (6.1) kg/m(2) (95% CI, 23.6-26.7). In 3 patients (3.7%), conversion to conventional laparotomy was required. Mean operative time was 181.1 (63.1) minutes (95% CI, 166.7-195.5). Mean docking time was 4.5 (1.1) minutes (95% CI, 2.2-2.7). Mean hospital stay was 2.5 (1.1) days (95% CI, 2.2-2.7), and 93% of patients were analgesic-free on postoperative day 2.
The particles were examined at light microscopy to study their morphologic features. Particle analysis was carried out using a laser diffraction particle analyser. Monopolar uterine tissue vaporization generated particles of a smaller median diameter than did bipolar vaporization (0.13 microm and 0.25 microm, respectively). The distribution by particle surface area in both instruments seems to be complex, with peaks at 0.35 and 4.0 microm for monopolar-generated particles and 0.5 and 5.0 microm for bipolar-generated particles. Another smaller peak with larger particles produced by both instruments was identified at 30 microm. During monopolar uterine tissue vaporization, 9.96% of particles generated were smaller than 5 microm, whereas during bipolar vaporization, 3.81% of particles were smaller than 5 microm (p = .01).
We analyzed the data to determine the outcome of SPA-LAVH and compared the initial 10 cases (group A) and the latter 14 cases (group B) to consider the learning curve. Median and range are used to describe non-normal data. A total of 24 consecutive patients have undergone SPA-LAVH, for benign gynecologic conditions, including 16 uterine myomas and 8 cases of adenomyosis, regardless of body mass index or previous abdominal or pelvic surgery. All cases but 3 were performed exclusively through a single port. The median operative time, weight of the uterus, and estimated blood loss were 119 minutes (range 90 to 255 minutes), 347 g (range 225 to 732 g), and 400 mL (range 100 to 1000 mL), respectively. The decline in hemoglobin from before surgery to postoperative day 1 was from 0.7 to 4.3 g/dL, with a median of 2.05 g/dL. The median hospital stay (postoperative day) was 3 days (range 3 to 7). When we compared the operative outcomes between the 2 groups, there was a tendency toward a decreased operative time in group B, although the difference was not significant. However, there was a significant decrease in the estimated blood loss and hospital stay in group B (p = .00, = .04, respectively).
Mean blood loss, mean duration of postoperative ileus, and mean decrease in hemoglobin were significantly lower in the LPS compared with the MLPT group (p &lt; .001). Mean operative time was not significantly longer in the LPS group compared with the MLPT group. Duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the LPS compared with the MLPT group (p &lt; .001). No intraoperative complications were observed during MLPT. In 1 patient, conversion from LPS to MLPT was necessary because of difficulty in reconstructing the uterine wall.
The diagnosis was confirmed by serum human chorionic gonadotropic concentration and at ultrasonographic or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent hysteroscopic removal of conceptive tissues under ultrasonographic guidance. Before surgery, 36 patients received 25 mg of oral mifepristone, 25 mg, twice a day for 3 days, and 3 patients received an injection of methotrexate salt, 50 mg, and underwent preoperative bilateral uterine artery embolization. Results were reported as good in 37 patients; only 2 patients required additional surgery.
Of the 212 patients who underwent tubal insufflation with air-saline solution, 52 demonstrated tubal occlusion, bilateral in 21 patients and unilateral in 31 patients, for a total of 73 suspected occluded tubes. At the HyCoSy test with SonoVue and CnTI, only 47 tubes seemed to be occluded, and in the other 26 tubes, passage of SonoVue was observed. HyCoSy with Sono Vue demonstrated high concordance for tubal obstruction with the laparoscopic dye test (94%).
Patients were asked to take a deep inspiratory breath, which accentuated respiratory excursion. The movement of the intraabdominal contents in a vertical fashion in relation to the abdominal wall, referred to as the "viscera slide," between the bowel and peritoneum was evaluated. Abdominal wall tissue thickness, Uracus to peritoneum thickness (UTP, mm) were also evaluated. Non parametric Mann-Whitney testing was used. No major demographic differences between the 2 study groups was noted. The abdominal wall tissue thickness was not significantly different between the 2 groups. The UTP was shorter in A group than in B group (1.5 +/- 0.3 mm vs 3.5 +/- 0.9 mm, p = .002). Absence of the "sliding viscera" sign was observed in 16 patients in group A and in 1 patient in group B. Patients with an absence of the sliding viscera sign were found to have subumbilical fibrous adhesions during laparoscopy.
Obstetric complications at term and neonatal outcomes after hysteroscopic metroplasty were compared between 2 groups. The rate of fetal malpresentation was significantly higher in group A versus group B (11/31 [35.5%] vs 0/62, p &lt; .001). Mean birth weight was significantly lower in group A versus group B (2940 g +/- 52 vs 3266 g +/- 456, p =.002). The rate of caesarean section was significantly higher in group A versus group B (19/31 [61.3%] vs 4/62 [6.4%], p &lt; .001).
Endometrial polyps were diagnosed in 31 women (12.1%). At 1 year, the polyp regression rate was 27%. Myomas occurred more often in women with endometrial polyps, and women with polyps experienced significantly heavier periodic bleeding compared with women without polyps.
The 168 patients underwent 172 laparoscopic bowel resections (4 patients were operated on twice) by the same surgeon. Lesions were distributed as follows: 133 (79%) in the rectum, 61 (24%) in the sigmoid colon, 47 (19%) in the appendix, 5 (2%) in the terminal ileum, 3 (1%) in the descending colon, and 3 (1%) in the cecum. At surgeon discretion, 12 lesions were not resected. A total of 216 bowel procedures were necessary to remove the 240 lesions include shaving resection in 22 patients (10%), discoid resection in 52 (24%), segmental resection in 92 (42%), terminal ileal resection in 2 (1%), partial cecal resection in 1 (0.6), and appendectomy in 47 (22%). Major complications occurred in 13 patients (7.6%) and included rectovaginal fistula in 3 patients (1.7%), rectosigmoid anastomosis dehiscence and bowel occlusion in 1 patient each (0.6%), and persistent bowel dysfunction in 4 patients (2.3%). These results are comparable to those reported in the literature to date. Complete relief of symptoms (measured using the Visick scale) was noted in patients with dysmenorrhea (59%), dyspareunia (75%), noncyclic pelvic pain (90%), pain on defecation (100%), constipation (83%), and cyclic rectal bleeding (100%).
The median and range of age, parity, and body mass index were 45 years (34-49), 1 (0-4), and 38 kg/m(2) (26-52), respectively. All women were receiving warfarin therapy (4-12.5 mg/d) for previous venous thromboembolism. Some patients had additional comorbid conditions and were at high risk for traditional medical or surgical therapies. After placement of the LNG-IUS, all women reported menstrual reduction at 3 and 6 months. By 12 months, 1 woman with large fibroids expelled the LNG-IUS and was treated with transfemoral uterine artery embolization. Two women had amenorrhea, and 7 had hypomenorrhea. At 2 to 5 years, 1 woman expelled the LNG-IUS and hysterectomy indicated extensive adenomyosis in a 195-g uterus, and 1 woman had hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, 4 were menopausal, 2 had amenorrhea, and 1 had hypomenorrhea. In the 5 women with uterine fibroids measuring 4.2 to 147 cm(3), the fibroids were reduced in volume by approximately 75% in 2, were no longer detectable in 1, were subsequently shown to be adenomyoma in 1, and required uterine artery embolization in 1.
Postsurgery, upon initial physical therapy evaluation, scores on the Penn Shoulder Score questionnaire ranged from 37 to 74 out of 100. All 5 wrestlers improved with rehabilitation such that their scores at discharge ranged from 81 to 91 out of 100. Mean external rotation-internal rotation strength ratio for the involved shoulder was 73.5% (range, 55.9%-88.7%) preseason and 80.9% (range, 70.2%-104.1%) postrehabilitation. Four patients were able to return to wrestling over a period of 1 season, with no episodes of reinjury to their surgically repaired shoulder.
IACFM-treated ligaments were 43.1% stronger (P&lt;.05), 39.7% stiffer (P&lt;.01), and could absorb 57.1% more energy before failure (P&lt;.05) than contralateral, injured, nontreated ligaments at 4 weeks postinjury. On histological and scanning electron microscopy assessment, IACFM-treated ligaments appeared to have improved collagen fiber bundle formation and orientation within the scar region than nontreated ligaments. There were minimal differences between IACFM-treated and contralateral, nontreated ligaments at 12 weeks postinjury, although IACFM-treated ligaments were 15.4% stiffer (P&lt;.05).
Significant differences in signal amplitude among exercises were noted for the gluteus medius (F5,90 = 7.9, P&lt;.0001) and gluteus maximus (F5,95 = 8.1, P&lt;.0001). Gluteus medius activity was significantly greater during side-lying hip abduction (mean +/- SD, 81% +/- 42% MVIC) compared to the 2 types of hip clam (40% +/- 38% MVIC, 38% +/- 29% MVIC), lunges (48% +/- 21% MVIC), and hop (48% +/- 25% MVIC) exercises. The single-limb squat and single-limb deadlift activated the gluteus medius (single-limb squat, 64% +/- 25% MVIC; single-limb deadlift, 59% +/- 25% MVIC) and maximus (single-limb squat, 59% +/- 27% MVIC; single-limb deadlift, 59% +/- 28% MVIC) similarly. The gluteus maximus activation during the single-limb squat and single-limb deadlift was significantly greater than during the lateral band walk (27% +/- 16% MVIC), hip clam (34% +/- 27% MVIC), and hop (forward, 35% +/- 22% MVIC; transverse, 35% +/- 16% MVIC) exercises.
The group-by-time interaction for the 2-by-3 mixed-model ANOVA was statistically significant for pain as the dependent variable (F = 64.8; P&lt;.001), indicating that patients receiving Kinesio Taping experienced a greater decrease in pain immediately postapplication and at the 24-hour follow-up (both, P&lt;.001). The group-by-time interaction was also significant for all directions of cervical range of motion: flexion (F = 50.8; P&lt;.001), extension (F = 50.7; P&lt;.001), right (F = 39.5; P&lt;.001) and left (F = 3.8, P&lt;.05) lateral flexion, and right (F = 33.9, P&lt;.001) and left (F = 39.5, P&lt;.001) rotation. Patients in the experimental group obtained a greater improvement in range of motion than thosein the control group (all, P&lt;.001).
FL insert use for 4 weeks resulted in a 12% improvement in total FFI-R score (mean +/- SD before, 35.6 +/- 10.9; after, 31.1 +/- 9.8 [P = .03]). FL insert use resulted in a 20% reduction in medial midfoot average pressure loading (mean +/- SD, 64.8 +/- 20.4 and 51.0 +/- 15.4 kPa, with 3Q and FL insert respectively [P = .015]) and an 8.5% reduction in medial midfoot contact time (mean +/- SD, 84.9% +/- 6.4% and 76.4% +/- 7.1% of stance, with 3Q and FL insert respectively [P&lt;.01]), compared to the 3Q insert. No differences in plantar loading were discerned between the shoe-only and FL conditions.
The response rate was 28.7% (233/811), 145 academic, 48 private, and 40 employed. More than 90% received partial to full financial hospital support. Only 7.3% received no outside support, most frequently those in private practices (16.7%; P = .016). More than 90% had resident or fellow coverage. Nearly all practices covered newborn conditions and solid tumors, with differences in pediatric trauma, patent ductus arteriosus, and urologic condition. Transfer out of community was low but increased for specific conditions during the respondents' absence, from 0.4% to 5.2% to 3.4% to 6.9% (P = .001-0.003). A minority of respondents noted that nonpediatric surgeons treated selected pediatric conditions in their communities as follows: inguinal hernia (38.4%), umbilical hernia (42.6%), abscesses (37.5%), and trauma (36.6%). Pediatric surgeons shared call within their group in 86.3%, whereas 5.6% took call alone. Many restricted call by excluding trauma (37.2%), soft tissue infections or appendectomies (21.3% for both), and older children (&gt;12 years, 23.8%). Nearly one fifth (18.9%) expressed interest in having an APSA surgeon serve as a locum tenens in their practices.
The mean (SD) weight gain per week in the CDH infants was significantly lower compared to non-CDH infants (89 [39] g vs 141 [49] g; P = .002). The breathing pattern between both groups differed considerably. In CDH infants, V(T) was significantly lower (P &lt; .001) and RR significantly higher (P = .005). The respiratory compliance was also significantly (P &lt; .001) reduced, whereas R(rs) did not differ significantly. No statistically significant differences were seen in FRC(pleth) related to the body weight between CDH and non-CDH infants (20.3 [4.4] mL/kg vs 21.5 [4.9] mL/kg).
Nine hundred seven patients from the registry were identified as having been both managed with ECMO and undergone attempted surgical repair. The survival rate for the entire Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Study Group registry was 67% and 61% for those receiving ECMO in whom repair was attempted (P &lt; .001). Among ECMO-treated children, survivors had a greater estimated gestational age (38 +/- 2 vs 37 +/- 2 weeks; P &lt; .01), greater birth weights (3.2 +/- 0.5 vs 2.9 +/- 0.5 kg; P &lt; .001), were less often prenatally diagnosed (53% vs 63%; P &lt; .01), and were on ECMO for a shorter period of time (9 +/- 5 vs 12 +/- 5 days; P &lt; .001). In logistic regression models, therapy-related variables, including the duration of ECMO, the nature of diaphragmatic repair, and the type of abdominal closure and certain comorbidities, particularly the presence of a concomitant severe cardiac abnormality, were independently associated with outcome.
Thirty-two children with blunt thoracic trauma were included as follows: group I (n = 14) and group II (n = 18). In all patients, there were 28 diagnostic procedures performed resulting in only 1 positive test-a bronchial tear found on bronchoscopy in association with obvious respiratory distress. Group I was more than twice as likely to undergo invasive procedures as group II (P &lt; .0001), resulting in significantly greater costs ($13683 +/- 2520 vs $5378 +/- 1000; P &lt; .002). Patients in group I also received more diagnostic imaging to assess pneumomediastinum (1.89 vs 1.08 studies/patient per day; P &lt; .05). More than 28% of all patients were completely asymptomatic and had pneumomediastinum as their only marker of injury. Strikingly, these patients received more than 46% of the procedures.
Associated cardiac diagnosis were present in 54 (30%) of 183 of all patients with vascular rings. Left thoracotomy was a common operative approach in all patients except pulmonary artery sling patients where a median sternotomy was the preferred approach. There were 3 early and 5 late deaths (all patients had complex cardiac anomalies) with a median follow-up of 6 years. Overall survival was 96% at 35 years. Postoperative complication occurred in 3 patients (2%) as follows: tracheostomy because of severe distal tracheal compression (n = 2) and left true vocal cord paralysis (n = 1). None of the patients showed any evidence of recurrent vascular ring anomalies at last follow-up. Of the children, 75% (135/180) were free from compressive symptoms within 1 year of the operation.
On comparison of the costal and costal cartilage lengths in the asymmetric group, the right fifth ribs and costal cartilages were significantly shorter than the left (P = .02 and .03, respectively), and right sixth ribs were also significantly shorter than the left (P = .004), but right sixth costal cartilages were not (P = .31). In the symmetric group, the lengths of the left and right fifth ribs and costal cartilages were showing no significant difference (P = .20 and P = .80, respectively), and those of the sixth ribs and costal cartilage were also showing no significant difference (P = .97 and P = .64, respectively).
Of 45 patients, 7 (15%) had liver nodules during a median of 80 months of follow-up. All the nodules occurred after PSSS. Five nodules were subjected to biopsy; we found 2 liver cell adenomas and 3 focal nodular hyperplasias.
A significant difference between the success and the failure group was found with regard to the number of bile ducts, the maximal length measurable in any direction for bile duct structures, and the proliferation, but not for any type of diameter. The normal portal plate was different from the portal plate of children with biliary atresia by always having 2 large biliary structures and the cells being mucinous and columnar in the largest bile ducts. Only 1 of 4 normal portal plates showed signs of proliferation. There was no significant difference between the normal and the success group with respect to the number, maximal length, and proliferation of the bile ducts. A difference in the diameter between the normal group and the entire EHBA group was significant for the maximal internal diameter but not for the other types of diameter measurements.
Thirty patients were initially treated by esophageal dilatation (ED), whereas 10 were treated by laparoscopic or open Heller myotomy (HM). Both groups were similar with respect to age (10.6 vs 12.4 years; P = .19). There were 18 males and 12 females in the ED group, compared to 5 males and 5 females in the HM group (P = .72). Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis, including dysphagia, vomiting, food sticking, chest pain, and weight loss, was 15.9 months for ED and 10.7 months for HM (P = .41). Mean time from diagnosis to initial intervention was 76 days in ED vs 86 days in HM (P = .78). Subsequent interventions by myotomy or both dilatation and myotomy were required in 9 (30%) of 30 patients in the ED group and 2 (20%) of 10 patients in the HM group (P = .70). A clear transition from open to laparoscopic approach occurred between 1995 and 2001. Mean operating times were comparable (186.3 vs 156.0 minutes; P = .48). Of 14 laparoscopic myotomies, 11 (79%) had fundoplication, and 2 (18%) of the 11 were converted to open procedure. Intraoperative mucosal perforation rates were similar between open and laparoscopic groups (17% vs 18%). At follow-up, 32% of ED patients vs 43% HM had complete symptom relief (mean follow-up duration, 75.2 months; SD, 196.5).
Of the surviving patients (69 minor OC, 20 giant OC), 12 were lost to hospital follow-up. The first questionnaire was returned by 64 (83%) of 77 patients. There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal disorders. Cosmetic problems were experienced significantly more in giant OC. The results of the COOP/WONCA charts indicated a good to very good quality of life in both groups comparable to the control group.
Preterm infants with gastroschisis had a 14 times higher risk for any of the recorded morbidities. As compared to term neonates with gastroschisis, preterm neonates with gastroschisis had a higher rate of sepsis, longer duration to reach full enteral feedings, and longer length of stay. Although the preterm infants with gastroschisis were less likely to be small for gestational age at birth, they were as likely as the term infants with gastroschisis to have failure to thrive at discharge and had a greater drop in weight percentile during hospitalization.
Plasma TOS and OSI levels were significantly higher at the end of the surgery than after induction of anesthesia (P &lt; .05 and P &lt; .01, respectively). On the other hand, plasma TAS levels were lower in the end of the surgery than after induction of anesthesia (P &lt; .05).
Five hundred consecutive Hickman lines were inserted between June 2004 and October 2006. Patients' ages ranged from 14 days to 19 years (median, 44 months). Patients weighed between 600 g to more than 100 kg. Lines inserted were all tunneled silicone Hickman lines with a Dacron cuff (size 2.7F-10F, with 1-3 lumens), of which 60% were 7F double-lumen lines. Successful cannulation occurred in 99.8%. Perioperative complications (within 30 days) occurred in 12 patients (2.4%) and were all treated conservatively with no need for either blood transfusion or chest drain. Catheter-related sepsis rate was 3.16 per 1000 line days.
Patient ages were 9 to 20 years (mean, 16). Seven were male. Renal failure was caused by glomerulnephitis in 4 patients, 3 had a history of obstuctive uropathy, 2 were diabetic and one had congenital nephrotic syndrome. Eight patients had PRA-AVFs created, 1 had an RC-AVF, and 1 patient required a transposition AVF. Follow-up was 4 to 56 months (mean, 32 months). Primary, primary-assisted, and cumulative patencies were 77.8%, 100%, and 100% at 24 months. No prosthetic grafts were used in any vascular access patient during the study period.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and esophageal atresia patients showed impaired growth, that is, both height for age (-1.5 standard deviation score [SDS]) and weight for height (-1.0 SDS). Overall neurologic outcome was normal, however, suspect or abnormal for 40% of CDH patients. Overall mental development was normal, but psychomotor scores were significantly lower than the norm (95% confidence interval, 83.8-92.2 at 6 months and 87.9-98.5 at 24 months). Sex, maternal age, socioeconomic status, CA, severity-of-disease covariables, and need of medical appliances at home could predict negative outcome significantly (P &lt; .05).
The results were compared by the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests for independent samples, both at the P &lt; .05 significance levels. Mothers stated that anxiety was different in the postsurgery period, showing a significant decrease when comparing the experimental and control groups. Both instruments to measure child behavior also showed that prepared children had less habit changes than the control group, which showed increased levels of inadequate behavior.
A total of 113 patients (65 males) were identified. At the time of survey, 57 patients (51%) were alive. Overall, there were 26 (23%) patients with constipation, and 9/23 (39%) had delayed passage of meconium after 48 hours. Despite frequent bowel disorders only 4 (3.5%) patients had undergone histologic examination of the rectum. Hirschsprung's disease was detected in 3 patients (95% confidence interval, 0.62-8.77). The expected number of HD cases in the study population was 0.026 giving 117-fold significant increase in the incidence of HD among patients with HLHS when compared to general Finnish population.
Eight cases (11.4%) in group A developed postoperative EC, whereas 11 (40.7%) in group B did so. The incidence of postoperative EC in group A was significantly lower than that in group B (P &lt; .005). According to the Rintala scoring system, the percentage of patients with an excellent score in group A (85.7%) was significantly higher than that in group B (P &lt; .05). The recurrence rate of constipation in group B was 14.8% (4/27), whereas it was 2.8% (2/70) in group A.
All patients presented at or shortly after birth with air and meconium tracking below the pelvic floor manifesting as either an expanding, meconium-stained aerocele or with perirectal spreading sepsis. Where abdominal signs were present, laparotomy confirmed the extension of the meconium perforation into the peritoneal cavity. Management was by diverting colostomy, drainage of the perineal collection, and supportive therapy. A posterior approach to the rectum and excision of a fibrotic section of the lower rectal wall was performed in one case. One case developed rectal stenosis that was treated by dilatation before colostomy closure. In all the other cases, digital examination performed before colostomy closure ruled out significant narrowing. There was no mortality, and the site of the rectal perforation healed in all cases to leave good anorectal function after treatment.
Two hundred three patients had sufficient data for complete analysis (42% males; mean surgery age, 15 +/- 7years). Surgical indications were ulcerative colitis (168) and familial adenomatoid polyposis (35). Surgical procedures included SIAA (112) and JPAA (91). Daytime and nighttime stooling frequencies were significantly higher (P &lt; .013) for SIAA patients at 1 to 24 months after pull-through; however, stooling frequencies began approximating each other by this time. Symptomatic pouchitis (compared to enteritis after SIAA) was significantly higher in JPAA patients (odds ratio, 4.5; confidence interval, 2.32-8.72). Frequency of pouchitis declined with time. There was no significant difference in the incidence of surgical complications between the 2 groups. Finally, continence rates were strikingly good in both groups compared to previously reported series.
Children enrolled in the study had a mean +/- SE age of 3.7 +/- 0.3 years and weighed 16 +/- 0.8 kg. Patients were predominantly male (82%). Patients underwent 1 of 3 types of open hernia repair as follows: unilateral herniorrhaphy without peritoneoscopy (n = 41; 31%), unilateral herniorrhaphy with peritoneoscopy (n = 55; 41%), and bilateral herniorrhaphy (n = 38; 28%). Skin closure time was significantly shorter in the skin adhesive group (adhesive = 1.4 +/- 0.8 minutes vs suture = 2.4 +/- 1.1 minutes; P = .001). Mean wound cosmesis scores based on the visual analog scale were similar between groups (adhesive = 78 +/- 21; suture=78 +/- 18; P = .50). Material costs related to herniorrhaphy were higher for skin adhesive (adhesive = $22.63 vs suture = $11.70; P &lt; .001), whereas operating room time costs for adhesive skin closure were lower (adhesive = $9.33 +/- 5.33 vs suture = $16.00 +/- 7.33; P &lt; .001). Except for a 7% incidence of erythema in both groups, there were no complications encountered.
We located and critically evaluated 526 cases. Fourth arch anomalies were usually located on the left (94%) and generally presented as acute suppurative thyroiditis (45%) or recurrent neck abscess (42%). Barium swallow and direct laryngoscopy were the most useful diagnostic tools. Treatment options differed mainly in recurrence rates: incision and drainage, 89%; open neck surgery and tract excision, 15%; endoscopic cauterization of the sinus tract opening, 15%; and open neck surgery with partial thyroidectomy, 8%. Complications after surgery occurred primarily in children 8 years or younger.
Torsion of WS should be suspected in any child presenting with acute abdomen. Moreover, in case of acute abdomen and intermittent abdominal pain, we suggest studying spleen position with ultrasound.
None of the experimental groups demonstrated complete elimination of marginal microleakage. There were significant differences in microleakage of the tested adhesives (P&gt;.001). IDS microleakage scores were similar to those obtained using the conventional cementation technique (CCT) for both adhesives. The highest mean bond strengths were obtained with TEBI (51.1 MPa), whereas SEAI showed the lowest mean bond strengths (1.7 MPa). IDS resulted in significantly higher bond strengths than CCT (P&lt;.001).
212 consecutive patients underwent TMMR without adjuvant radiation. 134 patients (63%) had high-risk histopathological factors. At a median follow-up of 41 months (5-110), three patients developed pelvic recurrences, two patients developed pelvic and distant recurrences, and five patients developed distant recurrences. Recurrence-free and overall 5-year survival probabilities were 94% (95% CI 91-98) and 96% (93-99), respectively. Treatment-related grade 2 morbidity was detected in 20 (9%) patients, the most common being vascular complications. Resection of the Müllerian compartment resulted in local tumour control irrespective of the metric extension of the resection margins. The pelvic topography of the peak relapse probability after conventional radical hysterectomy indicates an incomplete resection of the posterior subperitoneal and retroperitoneal extension of the Müllerian compartment.
The signature has a performance, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.4% (95% CI 77.7-93.2), 84.4% (66.5-94.1), and 86.5% (81.1-90.6), respectively, to predict patient outcome. Multivariate analysis indicates that the signature is a significant independent predictor of overall survival and progression-free survival after controlling for currently used risk factors: patients with high molecular risk have a higher risk of death from disease and higher risk of relapse or progression than patients with low molecular risk (odds ratio 19.32 [95% CI 6.50-57.43] and 3.96 [1.97-7.97] for overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively, both p&lt;0.0001). Patients at an increased risk of an adverse outcome can also be identified in the current treatment groups, showing the potential of this signature for improved clinical management. These results were confirmed in the validation study, in which the signature was also independently statistically significant in a model adjusted for MYCN status, age, International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, ploidy, International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification grade of differentiation, and mitosis karyorrhexis index (odds ratios between 4.81 and 10.53 depending on the model for overall survival and 3.68 [95% CI 2.01-6.71] for progression-free survival).
There were 24 510 eligible women at entry (18 386 in the revealed group, 6124 in the concealed group). In the first round of screening 233 women (1.27%) in the revealed group had CIN3+, compared with 80 (1.31%) women in the concealed group (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.75-1.25; p&gt;0.2). There was an unexpectedly large drop in the proportion of women with CIN3+ between the first and second rounds of screening in both groups, at 0.25% (29 of 11 676) in the revealed group and 0.47% (18 of 3866 women) in the concealed group (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.96; p=0.042). For both rounds combined, the proportion of women with CIN3+ were 1.51% (revealed) and 1.77% (concealed) (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.08; p&gt;0.2).
Bariatric surgery resulted in a sustained mean weight reduction of 19.9 kg (SD 15.6 kg) over 10 years, whereas the mean weight change in controls was a gain of 1.3 kg (SD 13.7 kg). The number of first-time cancers after inclusion was lower in the surgery group (n=117) than in the control group (n=169; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85, p=0.0009). The sex-treatment interaction p value was 0.054. In women, the number of first-time cancers after inclusion was lower in the surgery group (n=79) than in the control group (n=130; HR 0.58, 0.44-0.77; p=0.0001), whereas there was no effect of surgery in men (38 in the surgery group vs 39 in the control group; HR 0.97, 0.62-1.52; p=0.90). Similar results were obtained after exclusion of all cancer cases during the first 3 years of the intervention.
The energy intake was low in 75% of mothers, and 90% had low intake of essential FAs (EFAs). Dietary linoleic acid (LA, 18:2w6), but not w3 FAs, correlated to concentrations in breast milk. Infants' plasma and breast milk correlated for arachidonic (AA, 20:4w6), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5w3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6w3) acids. A high concentration of mead acid (20:3w9) in the infants at birth correlated negatively to the concentrations of LA, AA and w3 FAs. Infants of mothers who stopped breastfeeding during the study period showed decreased DHA concentrations and increased w6/w3 ratios, with the opposite FA pattern seen in the mothers' plasma.
The K1 allelic family was widespread in children living in the two sites, compared to other msp1 allelic families (frequency &gt;90%). The MAD 20 allelic family of msp1 was more prevalent (p = 0.0001) in the urban (85.3%) than the rural area (63.2%). In the urban area, the 3D7 alleles of msp2 were more prevalent compared to FC27 alleles, with a high frequency for the 3D7 300bp allele (&gt;30%). The multiplicity of infection was in the range of one to six in the urban area and of one to seven in the rural area. There was no difference in the frequency of multiple infections (p = 0.6): 96.0% (95% C.I: 91.6-100) in urban versus 93.1% (95%C.I: 87.6-98.6) in rural areas. The complexity of infection increased with age [p = 0.04 (rural area), p = 0.06 (urban area)].
Surgical procedures performed were osteosynthesis (72%) and femoral arthroplasty (28%). With regard to complications, 1 patient died during the intra-operatory period and there was 1 failure of ostesyntesis that required re-operation. There was an improvement in the quality of life measured according to the Karnofsky scale after the surgery (P=.017). Survival after surgery was 2 months in the group of patients with impending fracture and 5 months in the group of patients with established fracture (P=.816).
For the whole population, big endothelin-1 was 0.86 (0.61-1.20)fmol/ml. We evaluated its predictive value in detecting cardiovascular mortality, obtaining an AUC of 0.68 (0.08) (P=.02), and a cut-off value of 0.98 fmol/ml (sensitivity 69%, specificity 75%). When a logistic regression analysis was performed, big endothelin-1 was also an independent predictor of mortality (OR=5.851, P=.009).
The crude rate was 8.99 per 100.000 populations for year and the adjusted-age rate was 3.47 per 100.000 populations for year. The distribution of patients based on the MDACC index was: 31.4% had low risk, 62% had intermediate risk and 6.6% had high risk. The percentage of 5- and 10-years survival probabilities were 87% and 73% for low risk, 75% and 49% for intermediate risk and 29% and 16% of high risk. The GIMEMA index was unable to predict the overall survival in our patients.
In Group 1, males were 74%, the average age was 72.4 (SD 4.2) years, and the Child-Pugh distribution was 8.2% (A), 68.5% (B) and 23.3% (C).The most usual etiology of cirrhosis was viral (65.8%). In comparison with group 2, there was a superior frequency of renal impairment at admission, hepatocellular carcinoma and a viral etiology. Yet the bilirubin levels were higher in group 2. In-hospital mortality rate was 23.3%. The survival at 3 and 6 months was of 69.5% and 54.8%, while in group 2 it was 80.3% and 78.4% respectively (p=0001). An age&gt; 65 years, the existence of hepatocellular carcinoma and a Mean Arterial Pressure &lt;75 mm Hg at admission, in the overall cohort, were independent predictors of mortality.
We found that many of the articles surveyed included terminology, contextual descriptions, acronyms and titles that assumed a shared understanding of setting between authors and readers. We include illustrative examples in the text.
The measures showed no improvement on knot tying (GRS: P = 0.14; SSC: P = 0.7), marginal improvement on closure of laceration (GRS: P = 0.48; SSC: P = 0.003), and improvements on excision (GRS: P = 0.012; SSC: P = 0.003) and bowel anastomosis (GRS: P &lt; 0.001; SSC: P &lt; 0.001).
A total of 355 respondents (228 men, 127 women) returned a completed questionnaire (response rate 57.4%). Mistreatment was reported by 84.8% of respondents (n = 301). Verbal abuse was the most frequently experienced form of mistreatment (n = 256, 72.1%), followed by alcohol-associated harassment (n = 184, 51.8%). Among women, sexual harassment was also often reported (n = 74, 58.3%). Doctors were most often reported as abusers (n = 124, 34.9%), followed by patients (n = 77, 21.7%) and nurses (n = 61, 17.2%). Abuse was reported to have occurred most frequently during surgical rotations (n = 98, 27.6%), followed by rotations in departments of internal medicine (n = 76, 21.4%), emergency medicine (n = 41, 11.5%) and anaesthesia (n = 40, 11.3%). Very few respondents reported their experiences of abuse to superiors (n = 36, 12.0%). The most frequent emotional response to experiences of abuse was anger (n = 84, 41.4%).
Participants conceived that the pressure towards independence in clinical work originated in trainees' desire to lay claim to the identity of a doctor (as a member of a group of autonomous high achievers), and in organisational issues such as heavy workloads and constant evaluations.
A total of 210 students (107 guided, 103 experiential) participated in the study. At 3 months, 64.5% of the students in the experiential group successfully intubated the manikin, compared with 36.9% in the guided group (P &lt; 0.001). The experiential group also had higher overall scores, signifying quality of intubation attempts, at 3 months (79% versus 70%; P &lt; 0.001). Success rates and overall scores for both groups were comparable at 6 and 9 months, but were better in the experiential group at 12 months. Success rates improved with time, reaching 86% at 12 months.
The Harvey-trained group was slightly but not significantly better than the CD-trained group at identifying heart sounds (3.11 versus 2.47, respectively; P = 0.06). However, there was no difference between the Harvey and CD-trained groups in diagnosis (2.94 versus 2.84, respectively), communication skills (18.9 versus 19.6, respectively) or examination skills (17.4 versus 17.5, respectively).
Interprofessional relationships improved significantly (P &lt; 0.05) after the O&amp;G attachment. There was also some improvement of borderline significance (P = 0.05) in interprofessional teamwork and communication, as well as a non-significant improvement in perceptions of interprofessional interactions. Most (17/27, 63%) students stated that O&amp;G was their primary career intention after the attachment. They did not witness any bullying or interprofessional difficulties.
Students spent nearly 8 hours a day on clerkship activities. Most time was spent on observing doctors (40%), followed by participating in consultations without direct supervision (12%). The time students spent on observing doctors (r = 0.206, P &lt; 0.05) and in consultations without direct supervision (r = 0.211, P &lt; 0.05) was significantly related to the students' PHEEM scores. There was a significant relationship at the P &lt; 0.10 level between the time spent on directly supervised activities and students' PHEEM scores (r = 0.165, P &lt; 0.10).
Three interprofessional communication strategies were identified: (i) all participants routinely formulated 'workarounds' to circumvent problematic EPR-mediated communications; (ii) workarounds were classifiable as instances of Abandoning, Forcing or Submitting to the EPR, and (iii) novices learned workaround strategies through an informal curriculum, but they did not learn to manage the interprofessional effects of these workarounds.
Standardised observers accompanied a total of 51 medical students and watched 199 of their encounters with paediatric patients. The reliability of the communication skills scores from nine observed patient encounters was calculated to be 0.80. There was substantial correlation between the communication skills scores awarded by the clinic observers and students' communication skills scores on their OSCE cases (r = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001). Following 83.8% of the encounters, students strongly agreed that the observer had not interfered with their interaction with the patient. After 95.8% of the encounters, students agreed or strongly agreed that the observers' scoring of their communication skills was valid.
We found that SPs talk (55% versus 45% for students) and interrupt (74% versus 26% for students) significantly more than medical students. The scenario is significantly associated with the number of words and interruptions. Multivariable testing shows that female SPs are associated with more words. The number of words is significantly and positively associated with examination grade. The number of student interruptions is significantly and positively associated with grade.
As expected, ICMC students showed a steeper learning curve in both the basic and clinical sciences: at the end of their training students had attained higher levels of knowledge in both domains. The learning curve pertaining to the clinical sciences was almost linear, whereas that for the basic sciences showed a sharper rise, indicating a continuing growth of knowledge.
The mean particle size ranged from 230 to 360 nm, as measured by dynamic laser light scattering, and scanning-electron microscopy confirmed the spherical nature and smooth surface of the nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of void nanoparticles, drug-loaded nanoparticles and native DXY indicated no interaction between the drug and polymer in the nanoparticle. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis of drug-loaded nanoparticles indicated a molecular level dispersion of DXY in the formulation. The antibacterial activity of native DXY and DXY-loaded nanoparticles were tested using a strain of Escherichia coli (DH5alpha) through growth inhibition and colony-counting method. The results indicated that DXY-loaded nanoparticles are more effective than native DXY due to the sustained release of DXY from nanoparticles in the E. coli strain.
BP decreased proliferation of human colorectal, breast and leukemic cancer cell lines in vitro. However, BP had no effect on the proliferation and viability of normal human arterial smooth muscle cells and human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. in vivo, BP induced a moderate inflammatory reaction but had no mutagenic effects. After BP implantation the animals showed an inflammatory reaction followed 2 weeks later by a cicatrization reaction with the organization and fibrosis of the scar.
Splenectomy, antibiotic therapy and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide.
Light-microscopic examination of spinal cord specimens from group 2 revealed hemorrhage, edema, necrosis, and vascular thrombi 24 hours after trauma. Similar (but less prominent) features were seen in specimens obtained from group 3 rats. Twenty-four hours after injury, the mean apoptotic cell numbers in groups 1 and 2 were zero and 4.57 +/- 0.37 cells, respectively. In group 3, the mean apoptotic cell number was 2.30 +/- 0.34 cells, a value significantly lower than that in group 2 (P &lt; .05). Five days after trauma, the injured rats in group 2 demonstrated significant motor dysfunction (P &lt; .05). In comparison, the motor scores exhibited by group 3 rats were markedly better (P &lt; .05).
There was no displacement of bioabsorbable plates or screws in any case. In one case (0.46%), radiological imaging revealed osteolysis underneath the implant eight months after the surgical procedure. Prominences caused by the plates and screws employed were visible in two cases (0.93%). We found fractures in the osteosynthesis mesh in two patients (0.93%). Four patients (1.85%) presented local inflammation. No alterations of cranial morphology secondary to inadequate stability were observed.
The overall expression of ERBBs suggests that ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimers and ErbB4 homodimers may be major functional units of the ErbBs in MB, while ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers may play a more prominent role in addition to ErbB4-containing dimers in PA. Different expression patterns of ERBB4 JM transcripts in MB, PA and normal brain were observed. The JM-d variant was only detected in MBs, while JM-c was present in MB and PA but was not identified in normal brain. The expression of cleavable ERBB4 transcript variants was elevated in PAs and MBs compared with normal brain, while mRNA levels of ErbB4-processing proteases were similar in both tumour types and normal brain. This suggests that proteolytic cleavage of ErbB4 may be more common in MB and PA, which leads to signalling events divergent from those in normal brain.
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 1p, combined LOH on 1p and 19q, low MGMT expression and high Ki-67 expression were associated with oligodendroglial tumours, whereas high p53 expression was associated with astrocytic and mixed tumours. LOH on 1p and low MGMT expression were associated with grade II oligodendroglial tumours, whereas high expressions of p53 and Ki-67 were associated with grade III oligodendroglial tumours. In addition, high Ki-67 expression was associated with grade III astrocytomas. LOH on 1p and LOH on 19q were associated with nontemporal oligodendroglial tumours. Nonrandom associations were found between LOH on 1p and LOH on 19q, MGMT expression and p53 expression, and MGMT expression and Ki-67 expression, whereas mutual exclusions were found between LOH on 1p and 19q and p53 expression, and LOH on 1p and Ki-67 expression.
Immunoblots showed constitutive expression of PY14Cav-1 in cortex of control rats and a significant increase in PY14Cav-1 expression at the lesion site up to day 4 post lesion. PY14Cav-1 immunostaining was observed in the endothelium of lesion vessels at days 0.5-4 post lesion, in neutrophils at days 0.5 and 2 and in macrophages at day 6 post lesion. Dual labelling showed that 100% of vessels with BBB breakdown to fibronectin showed endothelial PY14Cav-1 on day 0.5, the percentage decreasing to 62% on day 4. On day 6, none of the vessels showed endothelial phosphorylated Cav-1.
There is insufficient information with regards to the existence of the various different schools on the side of the lay public. The connotations of the different groups are similar: independent of the level of familiarity, 4 different types of therapy can cluster-analytically be identified in relation to the 3 factors of the polarity profile (activity-potency-valence).
Our evaluation study found significant improvement in mental health status, life satisfaction, psychopathology, specific knowledge about depression and compliance. Using multiple regression analyses, we identified variables predicting a more favourable outcome in the participating patients. The vast majority of our sample would highly recommend PE to other depressive patients, and found an increase in knowledge about depression to be supportive.
Of the patients, 61.5% presented with seizures, and 34.7% had clinically defined epilepsy. The development of epilepsy was associated with CCMs located in the temporal lobe and the absence of symptomatic hemorrhage. After microsurgical resection in 44 patients with intractable epilepsy, 72.7% were completely seizure-free (Engel class 1), 11.4% had rare seizures (Engel class 2), 4.5% had meaningful improvement (Engel class 3), and 11.4% had no improvement (Engel class 4). Predictors of complete seizure freedom were gross total resection, smaller CCMs, and the absence of secondary generalized seizures (94% of patients were seizure-free with all 3 predictors).
Sixty-six patients were operated on by the lateral supraorbital approach. The median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score was 80 (range, 40-100). Three patients were redo cases in which the primary operation had been performed elsewhere. Seemingly complete tumor removal was achieved in 60 patients (91%); there was no surgical mortality. Postoperatively, 6 patients (9%) had cerebrospinal fluid leakage, 5 (8%) had new visual deficits, 4 (6%) had wound infections, 4 (6%) had cotton granulomas, and 1 (2%) had a postoperative hematoma. The median Karnofsky score at discharge was 80 (range, 40-100). Six patients had recurrent tumors; 3 underwent reoperations after an average of 21 months (range, 1-41 months); 1 was treated with radiosurgery, and 2 were only followed. During the median follow-up time of 45 months (range, 2-128 months), there were 4 recurrences (6%) diagnosed on average 32 months (range, 17-59 months) after surgery.
Notably, the grading of preoperative optomotoric paresis improved in 15 of the 17 patients who presented with that symptom. Complete recovery could be achieved in 8 patients. Complete recovery rates in patients with preoperative grading of "good," "fair," and "poor" were 77.7%, 20%, and 0%, respectively (P = 0.0088). Improvement of cranial nerve dysfunction was found in 32 of 34 deficits. No worsening of cranial nerve function occurred. Endocrinologically, the prolactin level was normalized in 13 of the 17 patients with preoperative hyperprolactinemia. Recovery of growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism were found in 3 patients (37.5%) and 1 patient (33.3%), respectively. Seventeen patients were followed for more than 3 years. Of these 17 patients, 12 patients received initial postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. The overall tumor control rate after surgery with initial adjuvant radiotherapy was 100% (median follow-up, 65 months; range, 36-126 months).
Intraoperative imaging revealed residual tumor and guided extended tumor resection in 17 of 55 cases. As a result, the percentage of gross total removal of macroadenomas increased from 58.2% to 83.6%. The accuracy of imaging evaluation of low-field iMRI was 81.8%, compared with early postoperative high-field MRI (Correlation coefficient, 0.677; P &lt; 0.001). A significantly lower accuracy was identified with low-field iMRI in 6 cases with cavernous sinus invasion (33.3%) in contrast to the 87.8% found with other sites (Fisher's exact test, P &lt; 0.001).
Eighty-three patients were enrolled in the study. Arachnoid infiltration was identified in 11 of 80 (13.8%) and CSFCM was positive in 20 of 77 (26.0%) specimens. Arachnoid infiltration and CSF cytology were found in 20.0% and 44.8%, respectively, for medulloblastoma/pineoblastoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), 6.9% and 3.6% for pilocytic astrocytoma, and 0.0% and 33.3% for ependymoma. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was negatively influenced by either arachnoid infiltration (40.9% arachnoid positive versus 65.4% arachnoid negative; P = 0.23) or CSFCM positivity (52.6% CSFCM positive versus 67.1% CSFCM negative; P = 0.03). The 3-year EFS for patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumor who had positive arachnoid sampling was 33.3%, compared with 67.3% in patients who had no evidence of arachnoid infiltration (P = 0.26). The 3-year EFS for patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumor who had positive CSFCM was 50.0% compared with 67.5% in patients who had negative cytological analysis of CSFCM (P = 0.07). Arachnoid infiltration and CSF sampling were congruous with M stage in 73.3% and 86.2% of patients, respectively.
Clinical and radiographic follow-up data were available for 82 hemangioblastoma tumors. Only 13 (16%) of the treated hemangioblastomas progressed, whereas 18 tumors (22%) showed radiographic regression, and 51 tumors (62%) remained unchanged in size. With median follow-up of 69 months (range, 5-164 months), the actuarial local control rates at 36 and 60 months were 85% and 82%, respectively. Radiosurgery improved lesion-associated symptoms in 36 of 41 tumors. During the follow-up period, 9 patients died of causes unrelated to the progression of their treated hemangioblastomas, and 5 patients developed radiation necrosis.
Of 317 patients with back pain, 147 (46%) were managed surgically. Compared with patients managed nonoperatively, operative patients had higher baseline mean NRS scores for back pain (6.3 versus 4.8; P &lt; 0.001), higher mean ODI scores (35 versus 26; P &lt; 0.001), and lower mean SRS-22 scores (3.1 versus 3.4; P &lt; 0.001). At the time of the 2-year follow-up evaluation, nonoperatively managed patients did not have significant change in the NRS score for back pain (P = 0.9), ODI (P = 0.7), or SRS-22 (P = 0.9). In contrast, at the 2-year follow-up evaluation, surgically treated patients had significant improvement in the mean NRS score for back pain (6.3 to 2.6; P &lt; 0.001), ODI score (35 to 20; P &lt; 0.001), and SRS-22 score (3.1 to 3.8; P &lt; 0.001). Compared with nonoperatively treated patients, at the time of the 2-year follow-up evaluation, operatively treated patients had a lower NRS score for back pain (P &lt; 0.001) and ODI (P = 0.001), and higher SRS-22 (P &lt; 0.001).
The average follow-up period was 28.1 months, with a maximum of 48 months. The visual analogue scale for back and leg pain and the Oswestry disability index, which recorded a preoperative mean of 6.7%, 7.2%, and 64.7% and a postoperative mean of 3.2%, 3.0%, and 21.47%, respectively, showed statistically significant improvement at the time of the last follow-up evaluation, compared with preoperative scores. There have been neither recurrent disc herniations nor spinal instability during the follow-up period.
The average age of the patients was 56 years; 29 (58%) were men and 21 (42%) were women. The most commonly affected level was L4-L5 (64%). The mean surgical intervention time was 94.3 (+/- 14.3) minutes. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 3.16 (+/- 2.3) days. The follow-up time after surgery was 4 years (48 +/- 6.6 months; range, 24-72 months). We obtained good or excellent results in 72% of patients, achieving good subjective satisfaction in 68% of the patients. The mean decrease in the Oswestry Disability Index score was 30.23 (+/- 24.29), the mean decrease in the leg pain visual analog scale score was 6.02 (+/- 2.57), and the mean decrease in the lumbar pain visual analog scale score was 0.84 (+/- 2.06). Adjusted mean differences were in all cases statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).
Eight complications were recorded: 4 device dislocations and 4 spinous process (SP) fractures, including 2 spontaneous fractures of the L4 SP in patients treated at L3-L4 and L4-L5. The following anatomic variants were demonstrated: markedly decreased interspinous distance (kissing spine-like), with concomitant facet joint hypertrophy, a posterior V-shaped interspinous area, limited accessibility of the space between the base and the tip of the SP because of facet joint hypertrophy and variations in the shape of the inferior surface of the cranial SP.
Offending vessels were identified correctly in 16 of 17 patients (94%) using the interactive visualization method and in 10 of 17 patients using 2-dimensional images. These data demonstrated a significant difference (P = 0.015 by Fisher's exact method).
Nine (0.5%) patients had a secondary causative structural lesion, 7 patients had a tumor, and the remaining 2 had a vascular malformation. Direct compression by dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar artery was noted in 12 (0.7%) patients. In 7 (0.4%) patients, only the distal portion of the facial nerve was compressed, and five (0.3%) had only venous compression. Bilateral HFS and tic convulsif were encountered in 7 (0.4%) and 6 (0.37%) patients, respectively. Fifty-six (3.4%) patients were younger than 30 years old at the time of microvascular decompression.
CCM lesions harbor somatic and germline KRIT1 mutations on different chromosomes and are therefore biallelic. Both mutations are predicted to truncate the protein. The KRIT1 somatic mutations (novel c.1800delG mutation and previously identified 34 nucleotide deletion) in CCMs from 2 different patients were found only in the vascular endothelial cells lining caverns. No obvious somatic mutations were identified in the 2 other lesions; however, the results were inconclusive, possibly owing to the technical limitations or the fact that these specimens had a small proportion of vascular endothelial cells lining pristine caverns.
The area of the necrotic core on virtual histological images (median, 8.0%; interquartile range, 5.0%-13%) was significantly smaller compared with that of the histological sections (median, 50%; interquartile range, 40%-63%) (P &lt; 0.0001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed poor agreement in the necrotic core measurement between virtual histological images and histological sections (mean difference, 39.8%; 95% confidence interval, 35.8%-43.8%). Severe IPH was significantly associated with a larger necrotic core and symptomatology (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0039, respectively). The area of necrotic core on the virtual histological analysis did not correlate with symptomatology (P = 0.70), but that on pathological analysis tended to correlate with symptomatology (P = 0.059).
High CRM1 expression (80% of cancer cell nuclei stained) was observed in 70 specimens and was related to the grade of malignancy. A strong inverse correlation was evident between p27 levels and both Ser10-phosphorylated p27 (P &lt; 0.001) and CRM1 level (P &lt; 0.001). We also reviewed each grade of tumors separately and investigated whether CRM1 expression predicted patient survival within each subgroup. In brief, CRM1 overexpression was significantly associated with overall survival (P &lt; 0.001).
A dynamic lumbar functional spinal unit that encloses a tethered nerve root can create significant stretch and/or compression. This phenomenon may be present in a variety of pathological conditions. These include anterior, posterior, and rotatory olisthesis as well as degenerative conditions such as the loss of disc interspace height and frank multisegment spinal deformity. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that stretch can result in nerve damage, the pathophysiology that may associate nerve stretch with chronic pain has yet to be determined.
The aneurysmal wall showed decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression compared with surrounding segments, the feeding artery, and native controls, whereas all other markers increased. Anti-CD68 staining indicated the absence of inflammatory cells in the aneurysmal wall. Comapping molecular marker distributions with flow fields revealed confinement of these molecular changes within the hemodynamic region of high WSS and high, positive WSS gradient.
At days 1 and 3 after simvastatin or saline treatment, cytokine levels in the lesion boundary zone were significantly higher in the simvastatin- and saline-treated rats compared with the sham group, peaking at day 3. Simvastatin only reduced the level of IL-1beta but not IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, compared with the saline group. Also, simvastatin significantly reduced the number of activated microglial cells and astrocytes compared with the saline control animals. There was also a trend toward improvement of modified neurological severity score, reaching statistical significance (P = 0.003) toward the end of the trial.
The results showed that both doses of simvastatin significantly improved functional outcome compared with the control, with no difference between the 2 doses. Simvastatin treatment of 1.0 mg/kg increased the number of morphologically intact neurons in the hippocampus, but treatment of 0.5 mg/kg had no significant effect. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies showed that 0.5 mg/kg simvastatin significantly increased BDNF levels within the hippocampus, but 1.0 mg/kg had no significant effect. Neither dose had any effect on BDNF levels within the cortex.
In experiment 1, both treatment groups had delayed onset of paresis compared with control. Compared with surgery alone, surgery + OncoGel resulted in superior median BBB scores on posttreatment days 9 (21 versus 19, P &lt; 0.001) through 14 (11 versus 8, P &lt; 0.005). In experiment 2, both treatment groups had delayed onset of paresis compared with control. Compared with surgery + XRT, surgery + XRT + OncoGel resulted in superior median BBB scores on posttreatment days 13 (21 versus 19, P &lt; 0.001) through 17 (12 versus 8, P &lt; 0.005). Median time to loss of ambulation (BBB scale score &lt;/=7) was maximized by the addition of OncoGel to surgery plus XRT: control (8.5 days), surgery alone (13.5 days), surgery + OncoGel (16 days), surgery + XRT (17 days), and surgery + XRT + OncoGel (19 days). In experiment 3, both treatment groups had delayed onset of paresis compared with control. Compared with XRT alone, XRT + OncoGel resulted in superior median BBB scores on posttreatment days 6 (21 versus 19, P &lt; 0.001) through 11 (13 versus 8, P &lt; 0.005). However, compared with surgery + XRT + OncoGel, XRT + OncoGel resulted in worse median BBB scores on posttreatment days 8 (20 versus 21, P &lt; 0.01) through 13 (7 versus 19, P &lt; 0.005).
The participants' mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age was 74.7 +/- 12.2 years. Almost one half of them (n = 46; 44.7%) were considered to have severe vision impairment (presenting visual acuity &lt;6/60 in the better eye). Disordered thresholds were evident initially. Collapsing the two middle categories produced ordered thresholds and fit to the Rasch model (chi = 10.1; degrees of freedom = 9; p = 0.34). The mean (SD) items and persons Fit Residual values were -0.31 (1.12) and -0.25 (0.78), respectively, where optimal fit of data to the Rasch model would have a mean = 0 and SD = 1. Unidimensionality was demonstrated confirming the construct validity of the PHQ-9 and there was no evidence of differential item functioning on a number of factors including visual disability. The person separation reliability value was 0.80 indicating that the PHQ-9 has satisfactory precision. There was a degree of mistargeting as expected in this largely non-clinically depressed sample.
In 1887, the right eye of a patient with lagophthalmic keratitis as a sequel to cancerous destruction of the lower eyelid was fitted with a protective blown scleral shell. His left eye was effectively blind. The referring ophthalmologist was Professor Theodor Sämisch of Bonn and the fitting was undertaken by the firm of F Ad Müller &amp; Söhne of Wiesbaden, Germany. With periodical replacement, a shell was worn for at least 21 years. Müller scleral shells were principally fitted in keratoconus providing markedly improved visual acuities and wearing times of up to 14 h a day. There were instances of continuous wear.
Distance and near VA were significantly better with monovision than with the multifocal option (p &lt; 0.05). Intermediate VA (p = 0.13) was similar with both corrections, whereas there was also no significant difference in distance and near CSF (p = 0.29 on both occasions). Reading speeds (p = 0.48) and the critical print size (p = 0.90) were not significantly different between the two contact lens corrections, but stereoacuity (p &lt; 0.01) and the near range of clear vision (p &lt; 0.05) were significantly better with the multifocal option than with monovision. Subjective assessment of near ability was similar for both types of contact lens (p = 0.52). The high addition multifocal lens produced significantly poorer distance and near CSF, near VA, and critical print size compared with the low addition alternative.
Protein recovery from care solutions was as follows (quantities are in microg/lens): AQuify (galyfilcon A: 0.56, lotrafilcon B: 1.24), Complete MoisturePlus (galyfilcon A: 1.44, lotrafilcon B: 1.47), Opti-Free Express (galyfilcon A: 2.31, lotrafilcon B: 5.67), and ReNu MoistureLoc (galyfilcon A: 1.17, lotrafilcon B: 4.38). For each care solution, greater quantities of protein were removed from lotrafilcon B (3.19 +/- 2.19 microg/lens) than from galyfilcon A (1.37 +/- 0.72 microg/lens). Lactoferrin, lysozyme, and lipocalin were the most commonly identified, whereas various keratin compounds and other unique proteins were also detected.
A total of 5171 people were observed by two independent observers, and the inter-rater reliability use of sunglasses was excellent (Cohen kappa = 0.83). Overall, 33.0% of people wore sunglasses. chi analysis revealed that significantly more people (p &lt; 0.001) wore sunglasses at swimming pools (35.1%) and parks (34.8%) compared to beaches (30.4%). Adults (41.6%) were more likely to wear sunglasses than children (12.3%; p &lt; 0.001). Gender was not significantly associated (p = 0.3) with the use of sunglasses (males = 32.7%; females = 33.3%). Those wearing hats were significantly more likely (p &lt; 0.001) to wear sunglasses (46.6%) than those with bare heads (28.4%).
The mean (standard deviation) CISS score was 30.21 (9.30) at baseline and decreased to 13.38 (9.44) with the BI-prism glasses, vs. 23.62 (10.76) with the placebo glasses. There were significant differences between the baseline survey score and the score with the BI-prism glasses (p &lt; 0.0001) and between the score with placebo glasses and the one with BI-prism glasses (p = 0.001).
There were no significant differences in the number of bacteria adherent to unworn AF and OK lenses. Analysis of lenses after wear showed OK lenses retained significantly higher numbers of viable bacteria than AF lenses in all studies.
Dry eye subjects had a significantly higher blink rate (p = 0.017, t-test). Both groups blinked significantly less during the game and letter tasks (p &lt; 0.04, t-test). Partial blinks were common as were clusters or "flurries" of rapid blinks, but there was no significant difference in blink amplitude for control and dry eye subjects. Tear film break-up in normal subjects was typically inferior; whereas dry eye subjects showed more tear break-up centrally and superiorly. Real-time video recording of tear break-up and blink behavior pointed to complex interaction between the two. Dry eye subjects shifted more toward intense ocular symptoms at posttesting (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank) than controls. Both groups showed a shift toward more corneal staining at posttesting (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank), which was typically inferior.
No clinically meaningful differences in total HOAs were found between brands or between the spherical and toric lens within a brand. Positive spherical aberration (SA) was reduced by all spherical and toric lenses compared to wearing no lens by 0.07 to 0.23 microm (p &lt; 0.0001). Frequency toric induced the greatest change in SA. The thin-zone design lens (Acuvue Advance for Astigmatism) had a statistically different amount of vertical coma (-0.04 microm) than the three prism-balast toric lenses (0.11 to 0.23 microm; p &lt; 0.0001). SofLens toric had the greatest amount of vertical coma, but better VA than Acuvue Advance for Astigmatism and Frequency toric. With the exception of Acuvue Advance for Astigmatism, toric lenses had greater absolute magnitude of vertical coma than their sphere counterparts (all p &lt; 0.002). No other significant HOA differences were observed.
For normal observers, values for the C-index (confusion) and for the S-index (polarity of an individual's pattern of cap reversals) begin to worsen when viewing distance increases beyond 2 m (corresponding to a subtense of 15 minarc). Thereafter, increasing values of the indices (deteriorations in color vision) fall exponentially with distance. We find that the functions for the Farnsworth and Lanthony panels are so highly correlated that the same function can be used for both. The cutoff index values for our conditions, values that differ little from those reported by others, correspond to a viewing distance of about 2.5 to 3.0 m.
Carnitine and its derivatives were detected in the tear samples. In DES patients, concentrations were substantially lower than in healthy subjects; the mean concentrations were L-carnitine, 3.27 +/- 0.80 and 8.94 +/- 0.50 microMol/L; L-acetylcarnitine, 1.66 +/- 0.50 and 3.05 +/- 0.65 microMol/L; and L-propionylcarnitine, 0.30 +/- 0.11 and 0.57 +/- 0.13 microMol/L, in DES patients and healthy subjects, respectively.
ADS activity was not greatly affected by pH changes between 4 and 6 and was greater per unit of biomass for cell suspensions than for biofilms. NaF was a poor inhibitor, while triclosan was highly effective with a 50% inhibitory dose for the two organisms between 0.03 and 0.05 and between 0.10 and 0.15 mm-h for suspension cells and biofilms, respectively. The weak acid indomethacin was nearly as potent at pH 4.0 as triclosan, while capric and lauric acids were less potent, especially for biofilms. The methyl ester of lauric acid was slightly stimulatory. The major targets for the inhibitors appeared to be transport systems for arginine uptake, although carbamate kinase was a secondary target.
The mutant devoid of the glmM gene displayed long chains, reduced growth rate and increased autolysis. Biofilm formation by the mutant was found to be attenuated.
Lysogeny was demonstrated in 4 of the 10 E. faecalis strains. Three of the lysogenic strains yielded phages exhibiting a Siphoviridae morphology, with long, non-contractile tails 130 nm in length, and spherical/icosahedral heads 41 nm in diameter. The virus induced from the fourth lysogenic E. faecalis strain had a contractile tail characteristic of Myoviridae. Restriction endonuclease analysis of NsiI and NdeI DNA fragments from one of the Siphoviridae phage isolates (phage phiEf11) indicated a genome size of approximately 41 kbp.
The pretreatment of cells with serine protease inhibitors significantly inhibited A. actinomycetemcomitans extract-induced expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. In addition, A. actinomycetemcomitans extract-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression was significantly decreased in PAR-2/siRNA-transfected cells.
A significantly higher amount of HMGB1 was detected from necrotic and apoptotic HGF. LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and E. coli significantly induced the production of HMGB1 in a time-dependent manner. After 6 h of LPS stimulation, HMGB1 was present in the cytoplasm of cells whereas its location was mainly nuclear after 24 h.
A mean of 8.3 P. intermedia sensu lato isolates from each subject/sampling was examined. During the second trimester, the mean number of P. intermedia sensu lato in plaque increased along with increasing signs of pregnancy gingivitis, and then both decreased. After delivery, gingival inflammation still decreased while the number of P. intermedia sensu lato transiently increased both in plaque and saliva. In the present study, the vast majority of isolates (95.3%) proved to be P. nigrescens and 2.5% were P. intermedia. The remaining 2.2% of the isolates could not be identified with PCR as P. intermedia or P. nigrescens. The corresponding percentages in the control population were 94.2%, 5.5%, and 0.3%.
The strains P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and P. nigrescens ATCC 33263 adhered to epithelial cells, the adhesion numbers of P. intermedia being twice as high as those of P. nigrescens. These strains invaded epithelial cells but invasion was weak. The adhesion of P. intermedia was specifically targeted to epithelial cell lamellipodia. The number of adhered P. intermedia cells increased or decreased when the formation of lamellipodia was stimulated or inhibited, respectively. None of the tested strains showed toxic effects on epithelial cells; a clinical P. intermedia strain even increased the number of viable cells by about 20%.
The forward primers were species-specific for these five Veillonella species, and could produce specific amplicons when used together with reverse primer and individual DNA templates of these species in PCR. These primer pairs were also found to discriminate between the respective species, and the Veillonella strains isolated from human oral cavities were successfully assigned to one of the five oral species of the genus Veillonella based on their specific products by PCR.
We detected HPVs significantly more frequently in lesions than in controls (P &lt; or = 0.001 in all comparisons). HPV prevalence increased gradually with increasing severity of lesions (32.8, 40.9, and 47.7% in OLP, OL, and OSCC, respectively). Copy number distribution patterns roughly corresponded to prevalence rates, but OLP and OL were comparable. HPV prevalence differed significantly between EA-OLP and non-EA-OLP groups (42.6 vs. 22.4%); EA-OLP group showed a prevalence similar to that found in OL.
Mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus grew at pH 4.0 but the growth of S. sanguinis and S. oralis ceased below pH 4.2 and pH 4.2-4.4, respectively. Acidification at pH 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and Actinomyces, respectively. Furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of S. sanguinis, S. oralis and Actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental pH had returned to 7.0. The acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus.
In GECs, the hBD-2 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in response to S. mitis-biofilm stimulation compared with S. mutans-biofilm stimulation (P &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the RNAase-7 mRNA expression was significantly higher in GECs when responding to both S. mutans biofilms and naturally formed biofilms compared with S. mitis biofilms (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The IL-8 and 5-LO mRNA was significantly upregulated in response to S. mutans biofilms (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively).
When BM-Mvarphi, obtained from diabetic NOD mice, are stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS under hyperglycemic conditions the following changes occur: reduced messenger RNA expression and cell surface expression of TLR2, reduced messenger RNA expression and protein production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, reduced signal transduction, and a reduction in phagocytic function. All the activity of BM-Mvarphi from diabetic NOD mice was restored when differentiation and stimulation occurred under normoglycemic conditions.
Salivary HCMV was detected in seven (50%) periodontitis patients, but not in any gingivitis or edentulous subjects (P &lt; 0.001). Salivary EBV was detected in 11 (79%) periodontitis patients, in five (33%) gingivitis patients, and in seven (54%) edentulous subjects (P = 0.076). Salivary samples showed copy counts of HCMV in the range of 3.3 x 10(3)-4.2 x 10(4)/ml and of EBV in the range of 3.6 x 10(2)-1.6 x 10(9)/ml.
Archaea were detected in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis at a prevalence of 70.7-73.2%, but were not detected in healthy subjects. Using one primer set, all sequences of the archaeal amplicons were identified as Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species. With another primer set, the amplicons were also found to be identical to the uncultured M. oralis-like species except one phylotype was found to belong to the class Thermoplasmata.
Proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. Identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors, and antibiotic-resistance proteins.
All patients had some degree of left and right ventricular dysfunction. Patchy mid wall gadolinium delayed enhancement was demonstrated, suggesting an underlying fibrotic process. Some degree of cardiomyopathy was universal. No evidence of myocardial infarction or fatty infiltration was demonstrated, but coronary artery disease cannot be completely excluded. Repeat scanning after 18 months in one subject showed progression of fibrosis and decreased left ventricular function.
Of 105 lesions delivered, 99 steam pops occurred. Twenty-one steam pops were preceded by MBII. MBII were seen in 26 lesions, five of which were not associated with steam pop. Surface temperature at onset of MBII was 87 +/- 9 degrees C versus a tissue temperature of 78 +/- 23 degrees C (P = 0.044). Surface temperature at the time of steam pops was 71 +/- 17 degrees C versus a tissue temperature of 102 +/- 17 degrees C (P &lt; 0.0001). The sensitivity of MBII for steam pops was 21%, and 58% for detecting surface temperature in excess of 80 degrees C.
No differences were seen between the groups in terms of acute success rate of clinical VT ablation (95% vs 100%, respectively; P = ns) and in the noninducibility of any VT at the end of the procedure (55% vs 85%, respectively; P = 0.08). Moreover, untolerated VTs were eliminated in 30% of group 1 versus 83.3% of group 2 patients (P &lt; 0.05). The mean total procedural and fluoroscopy times were 236.4 +/- 42.7 and 29.0 +/- 7.8 minutes in group 1 and 144.5 +/- 50.8 and 23.4 +/- 5.8 minutes in group 2 (P &lt; 0.001 and &lt; 0.05, respectively). At a mean follow-up of 15.2 +/- 6.7 months no differences were seen in VT recurrences between groups, but noninducibility at the end of the procedure was predictive of freedom from recurrences (P &lt; 0.001).
Increased scarring corresponded with increased ERP (P &lt; 0.01), decreased subendocardial electrogram amplitude (P &lt; 0.001), and slope (P &lt; 0.001). ERP did not differ between endocardium and epicardium (P &gt; 0.05). The ARI(m) and RT were prolonged during early myocardial activation (P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for AT, the RT and ARI(m) were prolonged in areas of scarring (P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for electrogram amplitude, the ARI(m) was prolonged in dense scar (P &lt; 0.05).
The CT height, width, and area were significantly greater in group 1 than in group 2 (P &lt; 0.001). In both groups, at the longest pacing cycle length during CS pacing resulting in CT transverse conduction block at some levels, the width and area were significantly greater at the levels with block than at those without block. During LRA pacing, the area was also significantly larger at the levels with block than at those without in group 1, but not in group 2. The slope angle of CT ridge was significantly steeper at the levels with block than at those without in both groups (P &lt; 0.01), but that was not the case with CS pacing. CT arborization in its inferior portion was more frequently documented in group 1 than group 2 (P &lt; 0.05).
Right ventricular (RV) sensing decreased in the first 6 months post-LVAD. Mean R-wave amplitude preimplant was 10.9 +/- 5.25 mV compared with 7.2 +/- 3.4 mV during follow-up (P = 0.02). RV impedance also decreased from 642 +/- 240 ohms at baseline to 580 +/- 212 ohms at follow-up (P = 0.007). There was a significant increase in RV stimulation threshold following implantation of the LVAD from 0.8 +/- 0.6 V at baseline to 1.4 +/- 1.0 V in the first 6 months postimplant (P = 0.01). A marked increase in ventricular tachyarrhythmia burden was observed in three patients. One patient displayed electromagnetic interference between the LVAD and defibrillator, resulting in inappropriate defibrillation therapy.
Gross and histological evidence of mild esophagitis was noted in dogs from groups A and C but not in dogs from group B. There was no evidence of esophageal stricture or fibrosis in any dog from any group.
We retrospectively analyzed three cases in which patients with RV active-fixation leads in situ also had coronary angiography. Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to determine the relationship of the lead tip at various pacing sites to the coronary arteries. A lead placed on the anterior wall was in close proximity to the LAD, whereas septal and free wall positioning was not.
Initial studies evaluated the ability of the AIGIS(RX) pouch to reduce Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi) infection in this model using clinical and quantitative microbial endpoints. Results demonstrate S. epi infection in all control samples, while no pathogens were recovered from samples with the AIGIS(RX) pouch. Systemic antibiotic levels were undetectable. Additional studies tested the efficacy of the AIGIS(RX) pouch with additional bacterial strains, Staphylococcus capitis, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter Baumannii. In each case, the device and implant pocket with the AIGIS(RX) pouch was free of any signs of infection. An assessment of biofilm produced by Acinetobacter demonstrated the elimination of biofilm formation on the implanted device.
During a mean follow-up period of 10 +/- 7 months, 53 patients (62%) had recurrent symptoms after ILR placement with the mean time to recurrence of 12 +/- 17 weeks. Of these, an arrhythmic diagnosis was established in 12 patients (14%). Forty-one patients (48%) did not have any arrhythmia during their symptoms. These patients were discharged from the electrophysiology clinic. Thirty-three patients (38%) did not have any symptoms following ILR placement. Out of these, device was explanted in 10 patients, while the rest are still being followed.
The study population consisted of 37 patients (59 +/- 11 years). At baseline, mean LVEF was 23 +/- 5%. Mean left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were 175 +/- 73 mL and 225 +/- 88 mL, respectively. At 3-month follow-up, mean LVEF was 41 +/- 9% (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. baseline), and mean LVESV and LVEDV were 108 +/- 65 mL and 176 +/- 73 mL, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. baseline). During 18-month follow-up, 12 (32%) patients had ventricular arrhythmias, resulting in appropriate ICD therapy. No significant relations existed between baseline LVEF (P = 0.77), LVEF at 3-month follow-up (P = 0.34), change in LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up (P = 0.28), and the occurrence of ICD therapy during 18-month follow-up.
We found that the presence of sodium citrate residues on AuNPs impaired the viability of the ATII-like cell lines A549 and NCIH441. Interestingly, the presence of an excess of sodium citrate on the surface of NPs not only reduced the in vitro viability of the cell lines A549 and NCIH441, as shown by MTT assay, but also affected cellular proliferation and increased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as demonstrated by Ki-67 and LDH-release assays respectively. Furthermore, we investigated the internalization of AuNPs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and we observed that particles were internalized by active endocytosis in the cell lines A549 and NCIH441 within 3 hr. In addition, gold particles accumulated in membrane-bound vesicles and were not found freely dispersed in the cytoplasm.
We have designed, implemented, and assessed a Perl-based workflow named DAWGPAWS for the generation of computational results for human curation of the genes and transposable elements in plant genomes. The use of DAWGPAWS was found to accelerate annotation of 80-200 kb wheat DNA inserts in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors by approximately twenty-fold and to also significantly improve the quality of the annotation in terms of completeness and accuracy.
We found a lifetime-prevalence of mental disorders (axis I) of 83 %. 80 % of the participants showed at least one personality disorder.
Four inpatient suicides and 14 attempted suicides of twelve inpatients were recorded during the 11-year period. Three of the 4 inpatient suicides and 6 of the 12 inpatients attempting suicide during hospital stay had a diagnosis of depression. Furthermore, 280 suicides before admission were attempted by 262 patients. Regression analysis revealed life time suicide attempt, ICD-10 diagnosis F43, period of onset of present episode less than one week and ICD-10 diagnosis F32 / F33 as significant predictors of attempted suicide before admission. Suicidal thoughts without concomitant suicide attempt before admission were recorded for 389 admissions of 346 patients. According to regression analysis, risk of suicidal thoughts before admission is increased for patients with life time suicide attempt, ICD-10 diagnosis F43, ICD-10 diagnosis F32 / F33, ICD-10 diagnosis F30 / F31, greater number of hospital admissions, short cumulative length of stay and non-chronic course of disease.
We finally included 11 studies in our review which show that schizophrenia causes societal cost of several billion Euros per year. After adjustment for inflation, costs per patient and year estimated between 1980 and 2002 tended to be relatively stable at around 14,000 to 18,000 Euro. Additionally, relatives are confronted with spending of 950 to 1,700 Euro due to the patients' disorder. Indirect costs are mainly due to early retirement or unemployment and amount to 25,000 to 30,000 Euro per patient when using the human capital approach. We found that changes in treatment settings and increasing costs of drug treatment seem to be reflected in published cost-of-illness studies.
There is an increase in the number of patients treated with antiandrogenic medication during the observed time period. Patients under this kind of pharmacotherapy receive higher grades of home leave steps.
The following sources of bias were identified: 1. The levels of evidence are related to the quality of studies, not to reported effect sizes; 2. external validity of studies are not taken into account systematically; 3. absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; 4. the ethical framework of many clinically relevant objectives cannot be represented adequately in randomized controlled trials; 5. achieved consensus between professionals, users, and relatives may be highly important and receives inadequately low levels of recommendation due to the definition of evidence.
No significant differences in executive functioning were found between the three groups. BPD patients showed, however, a decreased ability to delay a gratification compared with controls.
Compared to patients treated in hospitals, those insurants who had been on a two-year temporary leave were psychologically strongly distressed. There was also a gender effect: Women in particular showed significant limitations in daily activities/routines, a higher level of anxiety and somatization. Less than 30 % of the pensioners were motivated for vocational rehabilitation in order to return to their jobs. The motivation was not dependant on the psychological load and the age but most probably on the somatization tendencies and the daily activities.
Close to 25% of the mothers had high depressive symptoms. In separate multiple logistic regression models, education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07, 6.39) or unemployment (AOR=2.38; 95% CI=1.16, 4.90) and the use of quick relief medications (AOR=2.74; 95% CI=1.33, 5.66) for asthma were positively associated with depressive symptoms.
Of the 902 respondents completing the survey, 676 (75%) reported experiencing "any type of pain." Of these, 17% reported being diagnosed with chronic pain. Minorities reported a higher average daily pain than Whites (4.75 vs. 3.72; p&lt;.001). However, race/ethnicity did not explain utilization of pain treatment; income, education, age, gender, and pain levels explained more variability in different pain treatment utilization variables than race/ethnicity.
The experimental group showed greater improvement in understanding diabetes than the control (t=3.29, p&lt;.001). There was no significant difference in control of blood sugar levels (t=-1.72, p=.10) and self-care (F=1.03, p=.32).
Most registrants were female (92.5%), 45-54 years old (34.3%), Caucasian (84.5%), and college graduates (57.5%). Over 68% smoked 10-20 cigarettes/day; 66.4% smoked within 30 min of waking. Half of those with previous quit attempts did not use evidence-based methods; 30% had not made a quit attempt in the past year. "Read-only" social support was the most frequently used Nurses Quitnet feature.
Paired t test scores of the combined practically oriented questions were significantly increased from 1.8 to 4.6 (p&lt;.001) from pre- to posttest scores. Likewise, the practical demonstration of learned pump use skills significantly improved from 0.08 preintervention to 4.8 postintervention ( p&lt;.001).
The response rate was 58% (n=35 of 60 sample). The most compelling reason for enrolling was that the researchers recognized an unmet health need among the population (91%), followed by the opportunity to talk with other women in similar circumstances (74%), and the fact that nurses were conducting the study (57%). Comprehension of informed consent was high, most preferred a "group" consent process, and 100% trusted the researchers to follow procedures outlined in the informed consent document.
The pretest probability of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was 74%. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-5.3] and 0.3 (95% CI: 0.2-0.7) for the stress test and 10.0 (95% CI: 1.8-78.4) and 0.0 (95% CI: 0.0-infinity) for MSCT-CA, respectively. MSCT-CA increased the posttest probability of significant CAD after a negative stress test from 50% to 86% and after a positive stress test from 88% to 100%. MSCT-CA correctly detected all patients without CAD.
The FRL volume increased by 5%-25% (15% on average) after right PVE in patients with liver metastases and by 9%-19% (14% on average) in patients with biliary cancers. In all patients, the ratio of FRL to functional liver volume was &gt;or=30% after right PVE. No postoperative deaths due to severe liver failure occurred in the 20 patients who underwent extended hepatectomy.
Seventeen of 98 tumours were cystic or necrotic (12/17 hypointense and 5/17 hyperintense on DWI); the ADC value of hyperintense cystic areas was 0.97+/-0.23x10(-3) mm2/s. The ADC value of solid tumours varied between 0.64 and 3.5x10(-3) mm2/s. The rrCBV value was 1.4 (sigma 0.66) in low-grade gliomas; 1.22 (sigma 0.25) in lymphomas; 4.5 (sigma 0.85) in grade III gliomas; 3.18 (sigma 1.26) in grade IV gliomas and 2.53 (sigma 1.6) in metastases.
A total of 1,680 arterial segments was evaluated; 138 (8.3%) were affected by atherosclerotic alterations. Carotid lesions were confirmed in 23 patients (34 segments), involvement of peripheral vessels in 14 (57 segments) and abdominal aneurysms in three. Sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRA were, respectively, 95%-97% for head and neck vessels, 100%-100% for thoracoabdominal vessels, 98%-97% for thigh vessels and 84%-88% for calf vessels; concordance with the DSA findings was significant (p&lt;0.05). Subclinical atherosclerotic lesions were evidenced in 25 patients, involving carotid arteries (12 segments), peripheral vessels (21 segments) and abdominal aorta (one segment). All these lesions were confirmed by a second modality, and ten of these patients required further care.
CT colonography detected colonic masses in 12 out of 135 subjects (8%). It generated 93 false positives and 19 false negatives in the identification of diminutive lesions (&lt;or=6 mm), and 70 false positives and six false negatives in lesions&gt;6 mm. Sensitivity was 83% in smaller lesions and 93% in lesions&gt;6 mm; specificity was 45% and 59%, respectively.
Cyclopus sensitivity was 74.1% (R2=54.8%; CADx=41.9%) and was higher for interval cancers reviewed as screening error (90.9%; R2=54.5%; CADx=81.8%) compared with those reviewed as minimal sign (65.0%; R2=55.0%; CADx=20.0%). Specificity was 15.7% (R2=29.2%; CADx=17.9%). Overall accuracy was 30.8% (R2=35.8%; CADx=24.1%). The positive predictive value of a case with CAD marks [regions of interest (ROI)] was 23.4% (23/98; R2=16.0%; CADx=15.1%). Average ROI number per view among negative controls was 1.13 (R2=0.93; CADx=0.99). Cyclopus was more sensitive for masses compared with isolated microcalcifications (208 vs 62 ROI; R2=90 vs 213; CADx=192 vs 130).
Assessments were based not only on imaging but also on the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for determining pain and on changes in morphine-equivalent doses. In both cases, 3-month follow-up showed a statistically significant reduction of pain. In no case did local complications occur either during or after treatment. Only one patient treated with radiofrequency (1/9, 11%) developed low-grade fever and general malaise during the 6 days following the procedure, compatible with a post-radiofrequency syndrome, which was treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) only and resolved on day 7.
The total number of claims was 1,088. Of these, 302 were caused by alleged diagnostic errors in cases of cancer; 189 (62%) concerned breast cancers and mammographic technique. Assuming a constant frequency of claims filed by radiologists, we expect a further 637 claims relating to the study period, for a total of 1,725 claims, with 178 claims being related to breast imaging. The predicted rate therefore increases to 10.5 per thousand, equal to a risk of one litigation per radiologist per 10 years of work.
The PET scan had 94.05% sensitivity, 91.60% specificity and 93.36% accuracy; the CT scan had 91.07% sensitivity, 95.42% specificity and 92.29% accuracy. The combined procedures (PET/CT) had the following values: sensitivity 97.92%, specificity 97.71% and accuracy 97.86%.
Mean operator dose was approximately 0.8 microSv during vertebroplasty done with combined CT and fluoroscopic guidance and 5.8 microSv in procedures with fluoroscopic guidance alone. Mean patient dose was approximately 6 mSv for combined guidance and 8 mSv for fluoroscopic guidance, a difference that was not found to be statistically significant.
The time to perform the block was not different between the 3 groups (17 mins [SD, 7 mins] vs 13 mins [SD, 8 mins] and 13 mins [SD, 4 mins], respectively). The time required to obtain a complete sensory block was shorter for the 4 nerves in group &lt;0.5 mA, with a statistical significance for radial and musculocutaneous nerves in group &lt;0.5 mA versus group 0.5-0.64 mA and group &gt;0.65 mA. Patients in group &lt;0.5 mA had a greater success rate for complete sensory radial nerve compared with those of group 0.5-0.64 mA and group &gt;0.65 mA at any interval times between 5 and 30 mins (P = 0.0001). Supplemental local anesthesia was provided for the 3 groups more frequently for the median nerve, with no difference between groups. Group &gt;0.65 mA required 5 general anesthesias (20%) as compared with 1 (4%) in group &lt;0.5 mA (P &lt; 0.05). No adverse event (dysesthesia) occurred after 48 hrs and 45 days.
The estimated mean direct hospital costs were significantly reduced among TJRA patients when compared with controls (cost difference, 1999 dollars; 95% confidence interval, 584-3231 dollars; P = 0.0004). A significant reduction in hospital-based (Medicare Part A) costs accounted for the majority of the total cost savings.
Forty-nine cases received an epidural catheter before hepatic resection. Preoperative PTT, INR, and PLTs were within reference ranges in 47 of 49 patients. Twenty-three (47%) of 49 patients were coagulopathic in the postoperative period. The most common abnormality was an INR greater than 1.4 in 16 patients. Nine patients had a PLT of less than 100,000/microL, and 4 patients had a PTT of greater than 40 secs. Patients who developed a hemostatic abnormality were likely to have greater median EBL (400 vs 1400 mL; Mann-Whitney = 100.5, P = 0.0004) and have a greater median volume of liver resected (166 vs 1688 cm; Mann-Whitney = 57.0, P = 0.0004). There was no causal relationship to preoperative laboratory values, age, weight, or American Society of Anesthesiologists classification.
Any passage down to the T12 level was not observed after injection at the T10 level and also only after additional 5-mL dye injection at the L1 level; the genitofemoral, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves were stained with dye in cadavers. The times for block application were 5 mins (SD, 1 min) in group 1 and 16 mins (SD, 4 mins) in group 2 (P &lt; 0.001). The surgery start time was 25 mins (SD, 3 mins) in group 1 and 27 mins (SD, 6 mins) in group 2 (P = 0.234). In both groups, propofol and remifentanil were used in similar quantities during the perioperative period. Use of paracetamol tablets was similar in both groups (P &gt; 0.05). Whereas none of the patients in group 1 displayed motor block or contralateral spread, 2 patients in group 2 displayed contralateral spread, and motor block was observed in 1 patient. Twenty-three patients (92%) in group 1 and 24 patients (96%) in group 2 were satisfied with the method (P &gt; 0.05).
The mean maximum serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve for morphine and metabolites were not significantly different when EREM was administered alone versus 15, 30, or 60 mins after bupivacaine. Median time to maximum serum concentration and median apparent terminal elimination half-life were also comparable. Total fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia consumption was comparable among all EREM groups (with/without prior bupivacaine) but significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower compared with the bupivacaine + placebo group. Nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were consistently more frequent in groups receiving EREM after bupivacaine versus EREM alone.
The addition of CaCl2 overall prolonged the duration of blockade by lidocaine or bupivacaine. Adding 10 mM CaCl2 to 300 microM lidocaine caused a right shift of the steady-state Na+-channel inactivation curve, indicating that the CaCl2 reduced the potency of lidocaine. Rat sciatic nerves treated with 1% lidocaine coadministered with 5% CaCl2 showed microscopic signs of neurotoxicity.
The needle was exactly at the target point in 5 patients in the oblique view and in 3 patients in the AP views. The needle was within 3 mm in all patients in the lateral oblique view and in 8 patients in the AP view. In the remaining 2 patients, the needle was within 5 mm from the radiologic target. In 4 patients, we were able to identify vessels at the anterior aspect of the foramen, whereas 2 patients had critical vessels at the posterior aspect of the foramen, and in 1 patient, this artery continued medially into the foramen, most likely forming or joining a segmental feeder artery. In both cases, the vessels might well have been in the pathway of a needle correctly positioned under fluoroscopic control.
Overall, evaluators rated questions on the machine evaluation form as "very good" or "outstanding" 70% or more of the time for all machine models. The largest, most complex ultrasound machine was rated as having the best image quality by both inexperienced and experienced providers. Ultrasound machine models with the simplest ergonomic design and user interface were rated highest by inexperienced study participants.
Onset of complete sensory and motor blockade was similar in the 2 groups (17 mins [8 mins] in group U and 19 mins [8 mins] in group S; P = 0.321). Time required to perform the block was shorter in group U (3 mins [1 min]) as compared with group S (6 mins [2 mins]; P &lt; 0.0001). No differences were observed in success rate (89% in group U and 91% in group S; P = 0.881) and time to resolution of motor blockade (237 mins [45 mins] in group U and 247 mins [57 mins] in group S; P = 0.418).
The 2 techniques were similar with respect to block performance time and adequacy of the block for surgery. There was no significant difference between the blocks in terms of postoperative dysesthesias (23.9% in the axillary group vs 17.1% in the infraclavicular group at 2 days, P = 0.216, and 11.0% vs 6.31% at 10 days, P = 0.214). None of the dysesthesias were permanent. The infraclavicular block had a lower incidence of paresthesias during placement (P = 0.035) and was associated with less pain at the block site (P = 0.010 at 2 days, P = 0.002 at 10 days). More patients were willing to undergo the infraclavicular block as a future anesthetic when compared with the axillary block (P = 0.025 at 10 days).
No differences were observed between the 3 groups in terms of total anesthesia-related time (23.1-25.5 mins), success rate (95%-97.5%), block-related pain scores, vascular puncture, and paresthesia. Compared with the supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches, ultrasound-guided AXBs required a higher number of needle passes (6.1 [SD, 2.0] vs 2.0-2.6 [SD, 1.1-1.8]; both P &lt; or = 0.001), a longer needling time (7.4 mins [SD, 2.2 mins] vs 4.9-5.5 mins [SD, 1.9-4.2 mins]; both P &lt; or = 0.016), and a longer performance time (8.5 mins [SD, 2.3 mins] vs 6.0-6.2 mins [SD, 2.1-4.5 mins]; both P &lt; or = 0.008). Supraclavicular blocks resulted in a higher rate of Horner syndrome (37.5% vs 0%-5%; both P &lt; 0.001).
From 8 months old, the induced release of recently incorporated 3H-norepinephrine (3H-NE) from the ovary and ovarian NE concentrations increased, reaching their peak values at 12 months old and remained elevated up to 14 months old. Increases in sympathetic nerve activity paralleled changes in the follicular population, as well as disappearance of the corpus luteum. In contrast, luteinised follicles, precystic follicles, and cystic follicles increased. During this period, the relationship between Bax and Bcl2 mRNAs (the proapoptotic/antiapoptotic signals) increased, suggesting atresia as the principal mechanism contributing to the decreased follicular population. When NE tone was increased, the mRNA ratio favoured Bcl2 to Bax and antiapoptotic signals dominated this period of development. Thus, these changing ratios could be responsible for the increase in luteinised follicles, as well as precystic and cystic follicles.
Using this anti-NUDT9 antibody, we successfully demonstrated that NUDT9 protein was differentially expressed in endometrial glandular cells at different phases of the menstrual cycle. NUDT9 was also found to be expressed more prominently in the epithelial glandular component than in the stromal component of human endometrial carcinomas.
A total of 91 women were diagnosed with ruptured corpus luteum and hemoperitoneum (mean age, 26 years; range, 15-42 years). Most ruptures (60.4%) occurred during the secretory phase and most women (57.1%) reported recent sexual intercourse prior to the onset of pain. Most patients (81.3%) required laparoscopic intervention to achieve hemostasis. No obvious differences were found between the results of this study and those from the 1985 series, except that our patients were younger, were more often unmarried, chose laparoscopic interventions rather than laparotomy, and that there was an emerging trend towards conservative treatment.
Twenty-one of the 200 women developed preeclampsia, including eight who developed severe preeclampsia and 13 who developed mild preeclampsia. Compared with the normotensive women (n = 179), the hypertensive patients (n = 21) had significantly lower urinary calcium excretion (167.23 +/- 80.63 mg vs. 277.43 +/- 60.38 mg) and higher proteinuria (351.14 +/- 41.58 mg vs. 296.33 +/- 30.03 mg).
Two percent of pregnant women with GBS-negative results by culture screening at 35 weeks' gestation were GBS-positive at 39 weeks' gestation.
Postoperative abdominal distension was significantly lower in the Maylard group (p = 0.004). There were no differences in intraoperative characteristics and duration of hospitalization, hemorrhage volume, or duration of surgery between the two groups.
The mean age was 21.4 +/- 3.6 years. Early tiredness, appetite changes, and depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the group receiving calcium treatment compared with the placebo group.
The results allowed the identification of mutation-resistant positions.
Re-intervention rates were 14.0% (n = 6), 23.3% (n = 10) and 32.6% (n = 14), and failure rates were 7.0% (n = 3), 11.6% (n = 5) and 16.3% (n = 7), at the end of the 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up periods, respectively. Three patients failed to complete the 6-month GnRH agonist treatment, and four received surgical interventions.
The molecular function and biologic processes of IRF-1 and the combined IRF-1 and HPV E7 (IRF-1-E7) were derived using the GoFigure server. The combined IRF-1-E7 demonstrated more functions and biologic processes compared with IRF-1 alone.
Generalized estimating equation tests showed that the number of dominant follicles (&gt; or = 14 mm) during the 2-3 months of follow-up was higher in the calcium-vitamin D plus metformin group than in either of the other two groups (p = 0.03).
There was no significant difference in pregnancy rate between the two groups (acupuncture group, 30%; non-acupuncture group, 28.6%). The mean PI of both uterine arteries was significantly reduced after EA (left uterine artery, 2.3 to 2.0; right uterine artery, 2.4 to 2.2). There was no significant change in PI in the group with no acupuncture (left uterine artery, 2.5 to 2.3; right uterine artery, 2.4 to 2.3).
Karyotypes from chorionic villi and amniocytes showed 47,XX,+16 and 46,XX, respectively. Short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 16 suggested maternal UPD for chromosome 16. Affymetrix 10K SNP mapping chips were used to simultaneously confirm the difference in karyotypes between the placenta and amniocytes and to diagnose UPD for chromosome 16. Fetal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging identified severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Autopsy revealed IUGR, incomplete lobulation of bilateral lungs, and malrotation of the intestines. The karyotypes of umbilical cord, fetal skin and amniotic membrane were 46,XX, and the trisomy 16 karyotype appeared to be confined to the placenta.
Overall continence rates were 81% at year 1 and 87% at year 2. Attempted nerve sparing surgery, or successful nerve sparing surgery, did not result in better rates of continence than non-nerve sparing surgery.
Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with involvement of the prostate has been reported in multiple studies with an incidence between 12% and 48%. Stromal invasion of the prostate has a reported incidence between 7% and 17%. The incidence of primary transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate has been estimated at 1% to 4% of prostatic malignancies. Degree and depth of prostatic invasion has prognostic significance with 5-year survival rates being 100% for those with urethral mucosal involvement, 50% with ductal/acinar involvement, and 40% with prostatic stromal invasion. The actual anatomic path that urothelial carcinoma invasion occurs also has prognostic significance. Those with contiguous malignant involvement had a 7% 5-year survival rate compared with those with noncontiguous involvement and a 46% 5-year survival rate.
The analysis of renal cells showed that there was no significant difference in size between normal and cancer cells; however there were clusters of cells with different granularities. We divided the cells according to their granularity. The proportion of cells capable of extruding daunorubicin was significantly higher on tumor cells than in normal renal cells independently of the cell granularity. Our results are congruent with those obtained when mRNA or immunohistochemical test were used. This is the first report quantifying the P-gp activity from fresh samples obtained from kidney cancer in humans.
Anxiety mean scores were highest at the start of the stay in the hospital. About 36% of the patients were at least doubtful cases at T1. However, the anxiety mean scores from T2 to T4 were similar to those of the general population and lower than those of cardiac patients. Depression mean scores were even lower than those of the general population. Young age and receiving radio- and/or chemotherapy were predictive of higher psychological distress.
Both cell lines expressed VEGFR2, but did not express Kit. Sunitinib displayed activity against both cell lines in vitro at low micromolar concentrations, which are not attainable in vivo, and was synergistic with cisplatin. Activity was observed for sunitinib at 20 and 40 mg/kg orally once daily for 4 weeks, which attains low nanomolar concentrations in vivo against murine 5637 xenografts. Sunitinib 20 mg/kg/d in combination with cisplatin 4 mg/kg/wk intraperitoneally induced tumor regression compared to no therapy (P &lt; 0.0001) or cisplatin alone (P = 0.06). Cisplatin, sunitinib, and combination treated tumors displayed significantly reduced ki-67 expression compared with control untreated tumors, and the difference was also statistically significant for the combination compared with cisplatin. Cleaved caspase-3 expression was significantly higher for sunitinib single agent and combination therapy compared with untreated controls, and for combination therapy compared with cisplatin alone. CD31 expression was diminished for both single agents and combination therapy compared with untreated tumors.
The clinical response in the XAF1-high subset (n = 5) was remarkably higher compared with the XAF1-low subset (n = 9) (100% vs. 44.4%; P = 0.038). These results translated into a notably improvement of progression-free survival (PFS) in the XAF1-high subset (log-rank P = 0.012). In addition, patients in the XAF1-high subset had a 3.9-fold decreased chance of dying from the disease (hazard ratio for death (HR), 0.257; (CI 95%), 0.043-1.536, P = 0.036). When we evaluated the expression of XIAP, although an inverse correlation was found between expression and pathological response, there were no statistically significant associations with the clinical response, the length of PFS, and OS.
We investigated whether rs1447295 and rs13281615 are associated with disease risk in a hospital-based prostate cancer case-control series from Northern Germany. The rare allele of rs1447295 was observed at higher frequency among cases than among hospital-based controls (13.9% vs. 10.2%, P = 0.01), and there was a dose-dependent trend towards a higher prevalence of heterozygous and homozygous carriers among the prostate cancer patients (per allele OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07; 1.87, P = 0.02). By contrast, the rare allele of rs13281615 did not predispose to prostate cancer (per allele OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70; 1.00, P = 0.05). The distribution of combined 8q24 genotypes was significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.01).
Three children tested positive for HBsAg resulting in a prevalence of 0.8% (CI 0.2-2.5%). Hepatitis B 1 (Hep B 1) immunization coverage was found to be high, 99.1% (CI97.7-99.7) and 91.9% (CI 88.9-94.2) of children received the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 24h after birth. Coverage for the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine was 97.6% (CI 95.5-98.7) and of the children with complete immunization 84.7% (CI 80.9-87.9) had received all three doses by 6 months of age.
Radiography and ultrasonography each identified equal numbers of fractures of the tuber coxa (n=4), ilial shaft (2), ischium (3), femoral neck (2), and osteoarthritis/osis of the coxofemoral joint (6). Fractures of the ilial wing (4) were only identified by ultrasonography not by standing radiography. Of 9 acetabular fractures, 3 were identified on radiographs only, 5 were identified with both modalities. One pubic fracture was identified using ultrasonography and radiography. One acetabular and 1 pubic fracture were only diagnosed on necropsy.
Successful placement of the prostheses was achieved without major intra- or postoperative complications. Repairs were intact in all horses (follow-up range: 6-23 months) without evidence of adhesion formation. Cosmetic results compared favorably with those typically achieved using conventional, open hernioplasty techniques.
Screw loosening occurred in 13 cats (62%), with a mean loss of total screw purchase of 13% (range, 0-46%). Pelvic canal narrowing (mean decrease, 25%; range, 5-60%) occurred in all cats. Six cats (28%) had severe pelvic canal narrowing (mean, 52%); 5 of these had signs of recurrent constipation within 12 months postoperatively. Mean loss of total screw purchase in cats with severe pelvic narrowing was 28% compared with 9% for all other cats with narrowing.
Mean (+/- SD) screw purchase (89 +/- 11 mm) was significantly greater (P&lt;.01) with a dorsal plate compared with a lateral plate (33 +/- 8 mm). Significantly more screws (P&lt;.01) were used with a dorsal plate (median, 7) compared with a lateral plate (median, 6). Significantly less postoperative pelvic canal narrowing developed in the dorsal plating group between postoperative and 4-6-week follow-up radiography compared with the LP group (2% versus 15%, P&lt;.01).
Forty safe corridors were measured. The mean articular surface was 100+/-6.4 degrees from horizontal. Mean maximum, optimum, and minimum safe corridor drill angles from drill point A were 107+/-6.8 degrees , 97+/-6.9 degrees , and 87+/-7.2 degrees , respectively, from the articular surface. Mean maximum, optimum, and minimum angles from drill point B were 109+/-7.2 degrees , 99+/-7.1 degrees , and 89.5+/-7.2 degrees , respectively. Point B increased the risk of ventral exit from the sacral body.
Three cats and 1 dog had ear canal separation after being hit by a car; there was no history of trauma in 1 dog. Successful repair was achieved by a caudal approach to the ear canal, identifying and debriding separated cartilage edges and using primary repair. A patent ear canal was confirmed in all animals by otoscopy 4-12 weeks later and by ear canalography in 3 animals. Long-term outcome was excellent with no reported complications 10-90 months later (median 24 months).
Fibular fractures occurred in 5.4% TPLOs. Body weight, change in TPA, and preoperative TPA were significantly higher in dogs with fibular fracture. TPLO without use of a jig was significantly associated with fibular fracture. Age, postoperative TPA, and plate type were not significantly associated with fibular fracture.
Preoperative thoracic duct lymphography using this technique was successful in delineating the cisterna chyli, thoracic duct, and associated lymphatic vessels in all dogs. Immediate postoperative lymphography performed in 2 dogs revealed successful duct ligation in 1 dog and persistent lymphatic leakage in the other. A 1-month postoperative thoracic duct lymphogram performed in 1 dog revealed unsuccessful ligation or recannulation of 1 of 3 redundant vessels seen preoperatively.
Twenty-seven percent (64/233) of horses developed POI; 29 of 64 (46%) horses with POI had duodenitis proximal jejunitis (DPJ). When no intestinal resection was required at surgery, excluding horses with DPJ, 15% of horses had POI; 30% horses had POI after intestinal resection. Ten percent of horses had POI for &gt;24 hours. When horses with DPJ were excluded, factors associated with increased risk of POI included high packed cell volume at hospital admission (P=.024), increasing age (P=.0004), and length of intestinal resection (P=.05).
No screw penetrated the articular surface, the solar surface, or the semilunar canal in either group. CT was more accurate to identify guidelines for screw insertion (U=23.50, P=.049). With CT, surgical time (mean, 7.7 minutes) was significantly shorter (U=0.000, P=.000) than with radiography (mean, 12.7 minutes).
There were 15 dogs with mineralized ST and 9 with nonmineralized ST. Chronic, unilateral, intermittent or waxing-waning lameness, and pain elicited on palpation of the cranial aspect of the shoulder were the most consistent findings. On ultrasonographic or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 35 shoulders, enlargement of the supraspinatus tendon (54%), increased fluid content (63%), and medial displacement of the biceps tendon (60%) were observed. Eleven of 12 dogs with bilateral abnormalities only had unilateral lameness. Surgery was performed in 30 shoulders. Resected tendon specimens had myxomatous degeneration and/or cartilaginous metaplasia in 11 of 13 dogs in the mineralized group and all 9 dogs in the nonmineralized group. Functional outcome after surgery was poor in 3 dogs and good-to-excellent in 16.
Calcified chondroid tissue was prominent during distraction and calcified cartilaginous tissue during consolidation; both tissues were successively replaced by woven, lamellar, and osteonal bone.
There were statistically significant (P&lt;.05) increases in the proportion of all breeds of dogs evaluated as excellent and good from 1993 to 2003, controlling for gender and age at evaluation. Labrador Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and Rottweilers had the highest proportions of excellent and good scores, and the highest rates of improvement in excellent and good scores were seen in Bernese Mountain Dogs and Rottweilers.
Laparoscopic splenectomy required 70 minutes (range, 52-88 minutes) and was successful without major intraoperative and postoperative complications. Postoperatively, all goats had signs of mild abdominal discomfort. On repeat laparoscopy, with the exception of 1 goat that had a focal omental adhesion to the enlarged portal site, no other abnormalities were identified.
Cystostomy tubes were placed in 5 cats as an emergency procedure for treatment of acute urinary tract obstruction or urethral rupture, and as an elective procedure in 9 dogs and 1 cat. No complications occurred during cystostomy tube placement. Postprocedural complications were minor (peristomal irritation in 2 dogs with latex catheters, catheter laceration, premature removal) and only occurred when tubes were retained for &gt;4 weeks. Urinary tract infection at catheter removal in 6 dogs resolved with antibiotic administration.
An exploratory celiotomy revealed a 5 cm mass in the jejunum, involving the site of the previous surgery. The mass was removed by enterectomy. Dissection of the mass revealed the presence of many staples at the previous enterectomy site, and a trichobezoar entangled in the exposed parts of the staples.
Progressive improvement in weight bearing occurred during hospitalization (6 days) and at 3.5 weeks, no lameness was observed; radiographically, the patella was in normal anatomic alignment. At 15 months, there were no signs of lameness with unrestricted exercise and the alpaca had given birth to another cria.
Joint stability was excellent in 16 dogs (67%) and good in 8 dogs. None of the tibial components had evidence of migration or periprosthetic osteolysis whereas 1 femoral component was loose at 52 weeks. There was an early and significant decrease in tibial bone density, likely because of disuse of the operated limb. Dogs returned to full activity by 12 weeks. The tibial cement-bone interface maintained its strength over 52 weeks.
Stifle extension and excursion angles were significantly improved by 3 months after TKR. Mean peak vertical force and impulse were significantly improved by 6 months.
Cementless THR resulted in marked improvement in the alpaca's comfort level, degree of lameness, and range of motion. On preoperative force plate gait analysis there was decreased contact time (P=.01) and vertical impulse (P&lt;.01) of the affected limb, whereas at 8 weeks postoperatively significant differences in gait analysis between pelvic limbs were not apparent.
Observation and palpation of intra-articular structures were possible in all cadaveric stifles. Mean time to evaluate the femoropatellar space was 3.2 minutes (range, 2-4 minutes); to observe the cruciate ligaments, 5.8 minutes (range, 3-8 minutes); and to completion of joint inspection, 9.1 minutes (range 6-13 minutes). In the clinical cases, observation of intra-articular structures was also possible in all stifles. Mean time to complete joint inspection was 21 minutes (range, 10-40 minutes). Partial meniscectomy was performed successfully in 5 stifles.
Application of the stifle distractor medial to the stifle joint using 2 negative threaded pins was easily performed percutaneously without the need of power equipment; however, unintended intra-articular placement of 1 threaded pin occurred in 2 stifles, without appreciable consequence to joint function. Observation as well as thorough probing of the caudal horn of the medial meniscus, even in the presence of a prominent remnant of the CrCL or severe periarticular fibrosis, was possible. Partial meniscectomy was effectively performed as needed without apparent damage to the associated articular surfaces.
Tangential radiographic projections allowed the lateral half of the TMJ to be viewed without superimposition of other structures and the anatomic orientation was determined. A 70 degrees projection to the dorsal plane was ranked as significantly better than other views (P&lt;.001). There was no significant interobserver variation and the technique was safely performed in standing sedated horses with excellent image quality obtained.
Success in observing the rostral and caudal aspects of the VCS and RMS with each approach were: (1) rostral RMS approach (0 horses; 16 horses [40%]); (2) caudal RMS approach (0 horses; 11 horses [28%]); (3) light-indicated RMS approach (3 horses [8%]; 24 horses [60%]); (4) frontal VCB approach (24 horses [60%]; 29 horses [73%] respectively); (5) caudal VCB approach (16 horses [40%] both structures); and (6) combined VCB approach (27 horses [68%]; 35 horses [88%]).
The CFS approach permitted adequate observation of the RMS and VCS in 53 horses (88%). Hemorrhage caused by VCB fenestration prevented examination of the RMS and/or VCS in 12 horses (21%). Observation of lesions was possible in all horses diagnosed with neoplasia, sinus cysts, and progressive ethmoidal hematomas. Endoscopy of the paranasal sinuses was useful diagnostically in 82% of horses with primary sinusitis. Other diagnostic modalities were usually required to confirm a diagnosis of dental sinusitis.
Six months after surgery, the horse was no longer lame.
Gastric outflow obstruction was treated by gastroduodenostomy or by gastrojejunostomy with or without jejunojejunostomy. Long-term follow-up was available for 36 of 39 foals that survived to hospital discharge; 25 (69%) survived &gt;2 years. All 8 foals with pyloric obstruction survived &gt;2 years, whereas only 11 of 21 (52%) foals with duodenal obstruction survived &gt;2 years. Six of 8 foals with obstruction of the duodenum and pylorus survived &gt;2 years. Obstruction of the duodenum, adhesions to the duodenum, and postoperative ileus were significantly associated with decreased long-term survival.
Short-term recovery was complicated by return of chylothorax but this resolved after thoracocentesis and diuretic therapy. Three years after surgery, the cat is free of clinical signs and no longer on any medical therapy.
No soft-tissue trauma was found in gauze sponge-protected specimens. When protective gauze sponges were not used, full-thickness (sagittal plane) lacerations to the caudoproximal tibial muscle group occurred in all specimens with a mean craniocaudal width of 9.5 mm (range 2-12 mm). The cranial tibial muscle was traumatized in only 1 specimen without protective gauze sponges. Trauma to the popliteal vessels was not identified in any specimen. No gross cotton debris was identified, but microscopic cotton fibers (diameter, 7-35 microm) were identified in lavage fluid from all gauze sponge-protected specimens.
Tongue swelling rapidly subsided after symphysiotomy allowing the tongue to be repositioned into the oral cavity. After treatment of MMM with corticosteroids, jaw range of motion improved and at 6 months was approximately 70% normal.
Immediately after surgery, the foal had relatively good weight bearing. The HEF was removed at 60 days after radiographic confirmation of healing.
Dogs were evaluated approximately 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Limb function, muscle mass, and comfort level remained very good to excellent throughout healing. Bony union was confirmed radiographically and the ESF removed approximately 4 weeks after surgery (mean, 31.4 days; range, 28-37 days). Owner satisfaction was high when contacted a minimum of 4 weeks after ESF removal.
Fusion of the DIPJ was evident by 6 months. All cattle returned to full function with minimal lameness and normal appearance to the distal aspect of the limb. Four thoracic limbs and 3 pelvic limbs were affected; 3 medial and 4 lateral claws. Complications included moderate lameness associated with implants (n=2) that resolved after screw removal.
Median MIC of the 35 isolates was 32 microg/mL (range 2 to &gt;256 microg/mL). Mean PAE of selected MRSA strains had an overall mean (all amikacin doses) of 3.43 hours (range 0.10-9.57 hours). PAE for MRSA exposed to amikacin at 1000 microg/mL was 6.18 hours (range 3.30-9.57 hours), significantly longer than that for all other concentrations (P&lt;.0001). There was no statistically significant effect of isolate MIC on PAE.
No differences were found between IBS cases and controls in terms of IQ (102.0 +/- 10.8 vs 102.8 +/- 12.6), but IBS sufferers scored significantly lower in global constructive thinking (43.7 +/- 9.4 vs 49.6 +/- 9.7). In the logistic regression model, global constructive thinking score was independently linked to suffering from IBS [OR 0.92 (0.87-0.97)], without significant OR for total IQ.
The absolute enhanced value in the arterial phase correlated with the level of VEGF and MVD (P = 0.047, P = 0.001). The relative enhanced value in arterial phase and tumor-aorta enhancement ratio (arterial) correlated with MVD (P = 0.003, P = 0.022). Tumor-aorta enhancement ratio (arterial) correlated negatively with the extent of fibrosis (P = 0.004). The tumors with greater MVD and higher expression of VEGF tended to show high enhancement in the arterial dominant phase. On the other hand, the tumors with a larger amount of fibrosis showed a negative correlation with the grade of enhancement during the arterial phase.
A total of 547 cases of MC were identified, 376 patients with LC and 171 patients with CC. The female/male ratio was 3:1 in CC and 2.7:1 in LC patients. Celiac disease (P &lt; 0.001), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (P &lt; 0.001), and thyroid diseases (P &lt; 0.001) were found to have a higher occurrence in MC compared to the control group. No statistical differences in the occurrence of colorectal cancer, diabetes and IBD were found between the MC group and the control group.
Thirteen patients with PH secondary to MMM were identified. Median ages at time of MMM and PH diagnosis were 61 and 66 years, respectively. The interval from MMM diagnosis to presentation with one of the PH features ranged from 1 to 11 years. Variceal bleeding and ascites were the most common presentations. Of the eight patients who presented with variceal bleeding, six patients underwent endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) with no variceal recurrence or hematological worsening during a 12-mo follow up period.
Serum levels of hyodeoxycholic acid, the CYP3A4-mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA lithocholic acid (LCA), was increased significantly in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly. Total BA, total BA conjugate, and total BA glycoconjugate levels were decreased only in CD, whereas total unconjugated BA levels were decreased only in UC. In UC patients with hepatobiliary manifestations, the conjugated primary BAs glycocholic acid, taurocholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid were as significantly increased as the secondary BAs LCA, ursodeoxycholic acid, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid compared to UC patients without hepatobiliary manifestations. Finally, we found that in ileocecal resected CD patients, the unconjugated primary BAs, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, were increased significantly compared to controls and patients without surgical interventions.
HPV was detected in 15 (25%) of ESCCs. HPV-16 was the most frequently observed genotype, followed by HPV-18; HPV-59 was also detected in one case. Unfortunately, HPV genotype could not be established in three cases due to lack of material for direct sequencing, although universal primers detected the presence of HPV generic sequences. No low-risk HPV genotypes were found nor was HPV-16/18 co-infection. HPV presence in ESCC was not significantly associated with gender, age, alcohol consumption, smoking, anatomic location, or histologic grade. All patients belonged to low and very low socioeconomic strata, and were diagnosed at advanced disease stage. Male patients were most commonly affected and the male:female ratio in HPV-positive ESCC increased two-fold in comparison with HPV-negative cases (6.5:1 vs 3.1:1).
Fifty-five patients qualified for the study. Seven patients (12.7%) had pre-existing VP shunts. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics. The complication rate did not differ between VP shunt patients undergoing PEG (PEG/VP group) and non-VP shunt patients undergoing PEG (control group) [1 (14.3%) vs 6 (12.5%), P = 1.000]. All patients in the PEG/VP group had undergone VP shunt insertion prior to PEG placement. The mean interval between VP shunt insertion and PEG placement was 308.7 d (range, 65-831 d). The mean follow-up duration in the PEG/VP group was 6.4 mo (range, 1-15 mo). There were no VP shunt infections, although one patient in the PEG/VP group developed a minor peristomal infection during follow-up.
In the base-case analysis, the non-dominated strategies in cancer survivors were COL5, and COL3. The ICER for COL3 in cancer survivors was $5593/life-year saved (LYS), and did not exceed $10,000/LYS in one-way sensitivity analyses. If the risk of CRC in cancer survivors is at least two times higher than that in the general population, COL5 had an ICER of less than $10,500/LYS among both good and poor prognosis of index cancer. If the age of cancer survivors starting CRC screening was decreased to 40 years, the ICER of COL5 was less than $7400/LYS regardless of screening compliance.
Of 187 isolates from 120 patients, four were resistant to clarithromycin, while 183 were sensitive. The MIC of the resistant strains ranged from 1.5 to 24 microg/mL. Two isolates had an A2142G mutation and another two had A2143G mutations. A T2182C mutation was detected in two out of four clarithromycin-resistant isolates and in 13 of 14 clarithromycin-sensitive isolates. Restriction enzyme analyses with BsaI and MboII were able to detect the mutations.
The systemic hemodynamics remained stable throughout the experiment in both groups. In CPB animals, significant arteriolar vasoconstriction, blood velocity reduction and functional capillary density diminution were found. As concomitances, exaggerated albumin extravasation and increased leukocyte accumulation were also noted. These changes were more pronounced and there were no signs of restitution at the end of the observation period.
The Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged 0.833-0.960, well above the acceptable level of 0.70. Correlation analysis showed that each item had a strong correlation with the corresponding domain, but a weak correlation with other domains. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the comparative fit index was 0.94, higher than the acceptable level of 0.90.
L02/core cell line stably expressing HCV-core protein was established. The pGL3-OAS-Luci construct exhibited significant transcriptional activity in the L02/core cells but not in the L02 cells.
Fifty-four patients underwent reconstruction by esophagogastric anterior wall end-to-side anastomosis combined with pyloroplasty (EA group); 45 patients had reconstruction by esophagogastric posterior wall end-to-side anastomosis (EP group); and 50 patients had reconstruction by esophagogastric end-to-end anastomosis (EE group). The EA group showed the best postoperative QOL, such as recovery of body weight, less discomfort after meals, and less heart burn or belching at 6 and 24 mo postoperatively. However, the survival rates, surgical results and Spitzer QOL index were similar among the three groups.
Four of the 5 cases showed predominant changes in central nervous system, with encephalitis and encephalomyelitis identified mainly in brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord. Histologic findings included neuronal degeneration and necrosis, neuronophagia, perivascular cuffing and diffuse or nodular hyperplasia of macrophages/microglia. Cerebral edema, brain herniation and aseptic meningitis were also noted. The lungs showed mainly pulmonary congestion, neurogenic pulmonary edema and focal hemorrhage. There were minimal changes in the intestinal epithelium. The intestinal lymphoid tissue however was hyperplastic and associated with apoptosis of follicular center cells. The remaining case had cerebral edema and mild meningitis. The lung alveolar septa were thickened with lymphocytic infiltrates. Some alveolar cells were hyperplastic and associated with diffuse hyaline membrane formation. No specific abnormalities were identified in gastrointestinal tract. In all the 5 cases studied, there was enlargement of lung hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes, coupled with apoptosis of follicular center cells. In general, no significant pathologic changes were demonstrated in heart, liver and kidneys.
There were altogether 6 males and 4 females, with age of patients ranging from 23 to 59 years (mean=47.2 years). Clinically, the patients presented with chronic cough and shortness of breath for 4 months to 6 years. Histologically, 7 cases showed usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP)-like fibrosis. Patchy fibrosis was observed under the pleura, adjacent to interlobular septa and around bronchioles. In all of the 7 cases, foci of fibroblastic proliferation, as well as bronchiolar metaplasia of peribronchiolar alveoli and mild bronchiolitis, were noted. Three cases presented with mild honeycomb changes of lung and 3 cases showed non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP)-like fibrosis, in which the alveolar septa were expanded by fibrous tissue and collagen, with relative preservation of alveolar architecture. Bronchiolitis and lymphocytic infiltrates in alveolar septa were seen. Schaumann bodies were identified in 1 case. In general, patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis were younger than patients with idiopathic UIP. Computed tomography often showed upper and middle lobar involvement and mosaic attenuation. Compared with idiopathic UIP, the UIP-like fibrosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis often occurred not only under the pleura and adjacent to interlobular septa, but also around bronchioles and was accompanied by bronchiolar metaplasia.
The diagnostic intranuclear inclusions were found in erythroblasts in the bone marrow, liver, spleen and lungs in one case, in the spleen and liver in one case, in the spleen in one case, and in the placentas in two cases.
Patients included 21 males and 15 females. The age of patients ranged from 11 to 53 years. Atopy was very common in these patients. On plain CT scans, the affected nasal sinuses were filled with soft tissue shadow with patchy hyperdensity. The bony sinus wall showed areas of pressure erosion. Skin antigen tests showed fungal positivity in 31 of 36 cases. Serum levels of the total IgE and/or the specific fungal IgE were elevated in 20 cases. The eosinophil quantity was elevated in 23 cases. Fungal culture was positive in 10 cases. Gross examination showed thick putty secretions within the lesions. Light microscopy showed typical "eosinophilic mucin". Fungal elements were seen with AB-PAS, GMS and MUC5B stains. Electron microscopy demonstrated degranulation by the eosinophils.
On the basis of morphologic examination, 60 cases were classified as HP, 20 cases as TSA, 11 cases as SSA, 7 cases as mixed HP/SSA/TSA, and 6 cases as mixed serrated polyp/adenoma and tubular adenoma. Immunohistochemical study for Ki-67 showed that 40 cases (78%) of the 51 cases of HP were either mostly negative or rarely (&lt;25% cells) positive. Most of the positive cells were located at crypt bases. Among the 15 cases of TSA, 11 of them revealed positive cryptal cells (25% to 50% or&gt;50% positivity). Most of the positive cells were located in mid portion of crypts. The number and distribution of Ki-67 positive cells in SSA were similar to those in TSA but were significantly different from those in tubular adenoma and adenocarcinoma (chi2=34.601, P=0.000; chi2=63.077, P=0.000, respectively).
Of the 73 patients analyzed, 39 cases (53.42%) were histologically serous tumors, 32 (43.84%) were mucinous and 2 (2.74%) were endometrioid tumors. Diagnoses identical in those made by using either frozen or routine paraffin sections were 55/73 (75.34%). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of frozen section diagnosis were 87.30% and 85.94%, respectively. Underdiagnosis of frozen section were 18/73 (24.66%). There was no overdiagnosis cases obtained. Univariate analysis showed that tumor diameter and tumor histology were the predictors of underdiagnosis in frozen section analysis. And in multivariate analysis, only tumor diameter, rather than patient age, tumor histology and stage, bilateral side tumor, serum CA-125 and concurrent presence of endometriosis was a predictor of underdiagnosis.
The efficiency of pEGFP-N1 transfection of MGC-803 cells and U14 cells were 30% and 60%, respectively. Monoclonal GFP(+) cell strains-MGC-803-GFP and U14-GFP were established. The latency periods of tumor formation of MGC-803-GFP and U14-GFP were 3-5 days and 2-4 days, respectively. Their tumorigenicity rates were 100% in both. The tumor growth of MGC-803-GFP was well defined by the VFIS. Only one mouse was shown to harbor lymphatic metastasis by VFIS, 60 days after transplantation. The metastasis process of U14-GFP was depicted through VFIS on 27, 37 and 52 days post-transplantation. The incidence of pulmonary metastasis and lymphatic metastasis of U14-GFP was 67% and 100% respectively when the tumor volume was &gt;or=5 cm3. CD44 was positive and E-cadherin was negative in both tumors by immunohistochemistry.
The recombinant plasmids carrying myocardin-siRNA sequences were constructed successfully and the myocardin mRNA was reduced 42.86% by pGen-myo-shRNA in comparing with that of the controls (P&lt;0.01); and the expression of SM-MHC protein was down-regulated (P&lt;0.01).
A total of 3768 premature infants were admitted to the 9 hospitals during the investigation. The overall incidences of IVH and severe IVH were 9.3% (352/3768) and 2.1% (78/3768), consisting of 23.3% (82/352) for grade I, 54.5% (192/352) for grade II, 17.6% (62/352) for grade III and 4.5% (16/352) for grade IV, respectively. The overall incidences of IVH (5.1% vs. 14.1%) and severe IVH (1.5% vs. 2.7%) in 4 maternity and infant hospitals were significantly higher than those in five general or children's hospitals (chi2 = 89.045, P = 0.000; chi2 = 6.909, P = 0.009). The probable high-risk factors in the occurrence of severe IVH were premature rupture of the membrane, perinatal asphyxia, mechanical ventilation, twin or multiple pregnancies and amniotic fluid contamination.
Of the 1000 premature infants enrolled in this study, the data of 974 premature infants were finally eligible. The median gestational age of the 974 premature infants was 32.6 (31.0-34.1) weeks and median birth weight was 1732.2 (1447.9-2030.3) g. Three hundred and seventy-eight premature infants were born at &lt; 32 weeks of gestational age and the body weight of 285 premature infants was &lt; 1500 g at birth. The median time for initial enteral feeding was 2.0 (1, 3) days of life, 77.0% of the premature infants were fed with formulas for low birth weight, and 13.6% were fed with human milk mixed with the formulas for low birth weight. For parenteral nutrition, amino acid solutions were administered in 87.3% of premature infants and median time to begin was 2.5 (2, 3) days of life, median duration of administration was 11 (6, 17) days. Lipid emulsions were supplied in 56.9% of premature infants and median time to begin was 3 (2, 5) days of life, median duration of administration was 12 (7, 18) days. During hospital stay, 74.1% of the premature infants achieved recommended diet indexes of 120 kcal/(kg.d) (including both enteral and parenteral intakes) and mean time for achieving was (16.3 +/- 9.4) days of life, 84.1% of the premature infants reached enteral feeding of 100 kcal/(kg x d) and the mean time to achieve was (17.0 +/- 9.4) days of life. The lower the gestational age of premature infants was, the longer the time for achieving these goals was. Mean loss of weight was 7.54% +/- 4.7% of birth weight and the day for regaining to birth weight was (10.92 +/- 5.10) days. The lower the gestational age at birth, the more the loss of weight, and the longer the time for regaining to birth weight. Mean growth velocity after regaining to birth weight during hospital stay was (13.4 +/- 6.0) g/(kg x d). Mean length of hospital stay was (26.4 +/- 12.9) days. Of the 696 singletons, 60.0%, 58.9% and 29.5% of the infants had growth retardation by weight, length and head circumference respectively on discharge, while the morbidity increased by 32.7%, 30.9% and 10.2%, respectively, compared with those at birth.
Neonatal screening has become universal since 1985 in China. There were three modes of screening and treatment. From 1985 to 2006, a total of 13,229,242 newborns were screened for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and 6505 were diagnosed as CH at a prevalence of 49.2/100,000; a total of 13,666,750 newborns were screened for phenylketonuria (PKU), and 1,170 were diagnosed as PKU at a prevalence of 8.6/100,000. The prevalence of CH increased year by year and the western regions in China had a much higher prevalence. The prevalence of PKU was relatively more steady than that of CH in China.
Inspiratory stridor with chest wall retractions was cardinal symptom of newborn with LTDC. A slightly gray and round cyst with smooth surface at the base of the tongue was found with laryngoscopy. On computed tomography examination of larynx, a well-circumscribed lesion with low intensity was detected at the base of the tongue protruding into the air passage. Pathological examination demonstrated that the cyst wall was composed of tabular and columnar epithelium.
Vascularization up to zone I and II was considered to be immature retina; vascularization up to zone III or beyond was considered to be mature retina. In this study, 11 of 12 infants who were born at &lt; 30 weeks of gestation, 12 of 26 infants who were born at &lt; 31 approximately 33 weeks of gestation, 1 of 26 babies who were born at &lt; 34 approximately 36 weeks of gestation and none of 20 babies who were born at &lt; 37-40 weeks of gestation had immature retina; 12 of 15 babies at &lt; 1500 g BW, 8 of 14 infants at 1500 g &lt; BW &lt; 1700 g, 4 of 11 infants at 1700 g &lt; BW &lt; 2000 g and of 44 infants at &gt; 2000 g BW had immature retina. Those infants who were born at &gt; 34 weeks of gestational age and at &gt; 2000 g BW had mature retina. Infants who were born between 31 to 34 weeks of gestation and at 1501 to 2000 g BW had variable extent of retinal vascularization at birth. Vascularization was associated with postconceptional age (F = 31.9193, P = 0.000), birth weight (F = 32.4532, P = 0.000), anemia (F = 36.9391, P = 0.000), surfactant (F = 24.000, P = 0.0000), poor nutrition (F = 4.184, P = 0.041), RDS (F = 17.6191, P = 0.000), cesarean delivery (F = 10.972, P = 0.0022) and oxygen &gt; 48 h (F = 22.076, P = 0.0000). Vascularization was affected mainly by the postconceptional age (95% CI = 1.57-261.728, P = 0.021). At last, 15/24 infants with immature retina developed ROP while none of the infants with mature retina developed ROP (chi2 = 45.1087, P = 0.000).
A cardiac cause was identified in 23 syncopal patients presenting to the Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital: sick sinus syndrome in 7, congenital long QT syndrome in 4, third degree atrioventricular block in 2, supraventricular tachycardia in 2, ventricular tachycardia in 1, atrial fibrillation in 1, pacemaker dysfunction in 1, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension in 3, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 1, and dilated cardiomyopathy in 1. The average age of CS patients was 9 years. In totally 23 patients, exertion related syncope spells were found in 14 cases (60.9%), syncope spells at various position 7/23 (30.4%), absence of prodromes in 12/23 (52.2%), syncope spells with incontinence in 4/23 (17.4%), history of heart disease in 4/23 (17.4%). Abnormal standard baseline electrocardiogram was found in 21 cases (91.7%).
After 12 months of liquid rhGH therapy, growth parameters were significantly increased over baseline. (1) The mean (+/- SD) height increment DeltaHT (cm) was 4.0 +/- 1.3, 7.0 +/- 2.0, 10.3 +/- 2.6 and 12.9 +/- 3.3 after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment, respectively (P &lt; 0.01), which indicated linear growth after treatment. The GV (cm/years) was 2.7 +/- 0.9 before treatment and increased to 16.0 +/- 5.1, 14.1 +/- 4.0, 13.7 +/- 3.5, and 12.9 +/- 3.3 after treatment, suggesting that catch-up growth was significant after treatment as compared to the pre-treatment status (P &lt; 0.01). Accordingly, post-treatment catch-up growth was obvious, significant differences were observed in HT SDS, which was -4.62 +/- 1.46 at the onset of therapy and increased significantly after the treatment to -3.80 +/- 1.53, -3.28 +/- 1.60, -2.86 +/- 1.75 and -2.47 +/- 1.86, respectively (P &lt; 0.01). The height difference between GH deficient children and unimpaired children of the same age and gender gradually decreased after treatment, which was significantly different from that seen before treatment (P &lt; 0.01). (2) The levels of serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were increased comparably for the treatment. IGF-1 level (microg/L) was 41 +/- 64 at baseline and increased to 179 +/- 155, 202 +/- 141, 156 +/- 155 and 159 +/- 167 after 3, 6, 9, 12 months of treatment. IGFBP-3 level (mg/L) was 1540 +/- 1325 at baseline, and increased to 3891 +/- 1815, 4051 +/- 1308, 3408 +/- 1435 and 3533 +/- 1413, respectively, suggesting that with the increases in height, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 were significantly activated to relatively high levels by the medication and reached peak values between 3 and 6 months of treatment. The levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were significantly different before and after treatment (P &lt; 0.01). The IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio significantly increased during GH therapy (0.143 +/- 0.013 pre-therapy up to 0.240 +/- 0.055 post-therapy, P &lt; 0.01). The IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio tended to stabilize after 3-month GH therapy. (3) The bone age assessment carried out 6 and 12 months after treatment showed that the bone maturity (DeltaBA/DeltaCA) was 1.01 +/- 0.57 and 1.07 +/- 0.75, respectively, suggesting that there was no speed-up development in the bone age. No severe adverse events were observed during the trial and the most frequent accompanying event was mild hypothyroidism.
The overall rate of response to IST regimen I was 26.92% and to IST regimen II was 33.33%. The response to IST regimen III (62.5%) was significantly higher (P = 0.001). The response to IST regimen I and IST regimen II had no significant difference. The 5-year overall survival for IST regimens I, II, and III was 20.50% +/- 15.41%, 39.77% +/- 9.77%, and 66.27% +/- 6.84%, respectively.
After 24 hours of culture, 2E8-Genistein showed marked target killing on Nalm-6 cells at nine different concentrations from 20 nmol/L through 100 nmol/L with cell survival rates from (71.8 +/- 7.9)% down to (16.6 +/- 12.9)%, respectively (n = 3), which were all significantly lower than that of control group (100 +/- 13.9)% (P &lt; 0.05). The killing effect was even more significant when the concentration was over 80 nmol/L. The growth inhibition rates of this immunotoxin on Nalm-6 cells were 82%, 84% and 94%, respectively at 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture in a time dependent manner. Significant difference was observed between the cell growth curve of Nalm-6 cultured with 100 nmol/L of 2E8-Gen and those of Nalm-6 cultured with medium (blank), PBS (negative control) or the same concentration of pure 2E8 antibody (negative control) groups (F = 152.15, P = 2.15 x 10(-7)), but there was no significant difference among the three control groups (F = 1.51, P = 0.29). When Molt-3 cells were used as target cells, the cell growth curves of Molt-3 cultured with 2E8-Gen (100 nmol/L) and with negative control of blank did not show any significant difference (F = 0.34, P = 0.59). PI/FITC Annexin V double staining analysis with flow cytometry showed that the positive rate (33.45 +/- 8.77)% of early apoptosis on Nalm-6 cells induced by 100 nmol/L of 2E8-Genistein was significantly higher than that of negative control of blank (10.44% +/- 1.28%, t = -4.39, P = 0.001) at 24 hours of culture.
Fifteen samples were positive for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) by antigen detection (10.3%), 82 samples were positive in mycoplasma cultivation (56.2%), and among the 82 samples, 58 were positive for Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu, 39.7%), 9 were positive for Mycoplasma hominis (Mh, 6.2%), and 15 were positive for Uu and Mh (10.3%). Of all the samples, 4 were positive for both Uu and Ct (2.7%). The rates of drug resistance of the 10 commonly used antibiotics were as follows: erythromycin 32.9%, roxithromycin 41.5%, josamycin 19.5%, leucomycin 22.0%, meleumycin 28.0%, rovamycin 30.5%, azithromycin 37.8%, clarithromycin 26.8%, davercin 24.4%, and clindamycin 26.8%, respectively. The results indicated that drug resistance rates of josamycin and leucomycin were the lowest, and the rates of roxithromycin and azithromycin were the highest.
The serum GM ODI in IPA group [1.03 (0.16 - 3.73)] was significantly higher than that in the other invasive pulmonary fungal infection group [0.30 (0.04 - 1.28)] and pulmonary non-fungal infection group [0.24 (0.08 - 0.69)] (P &lt; 0.05). If the cut-off GM ODI was set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for IPA were 71.4% and 91.9% respectively. The accuracy rate for IPA was 88.6%. If the cut-off GM ODI was set at 0.8, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rate for IPA were 64.2%, 98.6% and 93.2% respectively. Of 6 children whose GM were observed serially, GM ODI declined consistently with the clinical remission in 3 children. GM ODI raised in 2 children corresponding to clinical exacerbation. Whereas GM ODI elevated paradoxically regardless of clinical remission in the remaining one patient.
Bronchoscopic examination indicated tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia in 148 cases, tracheomalacia in 77 cases and bronchomalacia in 71 cases. Among the cases with tracheomalacia, compression by vascular rings was found in 46 cases, incorporated congenital esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula was found in 5 cases, tracheomalacia was associated with tracheostoma and mechanical ventilation in 6 cases, with congenital airway malformation in 11 cases and isolated tracheomalacia was found in 4 cases. Among the cases with bronchomalacia, incorporated congenital cardiovascular malformation was found in 64 cases, congenital airway malformation in 6 cases and isolated bronchomalacia in 1 case. Ten children with anomalous innominate artery underwent aortopexy, twelve children with dextro-aorta arch with concomitant aberrant left subclavian artery and double aorta underwent arches vascular ring lysis, six children with pulmonary sling underwent plasty. Severe malacia segments were resected directly in four children during operation. Mechanical ventilation was performed in 38 children. Tracheostoma was performed in 4 children to treat tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, it could relieve symptom to a certain extent. In 2 children metal stents were inserted into the bronchus for the treatment of bronchomalacia, one was successful and the other needed re-insertion of stent again, these two patients underwent balloon-dilatation in distal part of stent afterwards.
Airway resistance values of group A, B, C, D, E, F after ovalbumin excitation for 30 min were (3.56 +/- 0.21), (7.06 +/- 0.63), (6.46 +/- 0.38), (7.47 +/- 0.33), (8.87 +/- 0.61), (11.00 +/- 0.69) cm H2O/(ml.s).

The difference between Groups B, C, D, E, F and Group A was statistically significant. There was significant difference between groups C, D, E, F and group B (F = 46.462, P &lt; 0.05); Lung tissue biopsy in group A showed that the epithelial cells were intact, no inflammatory cells infiltrations were found around the airways, instead, mainly ciliated columnar epithelial cells and only a small number of goblet cells were seen without basement membrane fibrosis. With the inhalation of DEP, the epithelial cells showed gradual necrosis, disruption and loss, goblet cells showed hyperplasia, and infiltrations with inflammatory cells were seen around the airway. In the lung tissue, concentrations of IL-5 in group B, C, and E were (12.8 +/- 2.8), (17.1 +/- 5.2), (18.6 +/- 4.2) pg/mg, the difference between groups C, E and group B was statistically significant (F = 4.236, P &lt; 0.01), the difference in gamma-interferon concentration among all groups was not statistically significance (F = 1.185, P &gt; 0.05).
Two allelic variants of exon 5 (c.684A &gt; G) and exon 6 (c.851C &gt; T) and a nonsense mutation of exon 7 (c.892C &gt; T) were detected in IDS gene of the proband. Heterozygous mutations c.684A &gt; G, c.851C &gt; T and c.892C &gt; T were detected in both proband's mother and maternal grandmother. The unknown variations of c.684A &gt; G and c.851C &gt; T were not found in the 100 unrelated control males. The male fetus (IV11) inherited the same mutation of IDS gene as the proband.
(1) Among all the obese children, the prevalence of NAFLD, SNAFL, NASH and MS was 65.9% (203), 45.5% (140), 20.5% (63) and 24.7% (76) respectively. Among all the MS children, the prevalence of NAFLD was 84.2% (64/76). The prevalence of MS was 29.3% (41/140) in SNAFL group and 36.5% (23/63) in NASH group, which was significantly higher than that of OCWLD group 11.4% (12/105) (P &lt; 0.05), but no significant difference was found between SNAFL group and NASH group (P &gt; 0.05). Moreover, there were significantly higher incidences in NASH group concerning every component of MS (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia) compared with that of OCWLD group. The incidence of hypertension in SNAFL was significantly higher than that of OCWLD group. And the incidence of hyperlipidemia was markedly increased in NASH group compared with SNAFL group. NAFLD group had higher free insulin and more severe IR compared with that of OCWLD group. When OCWLD developed to SNAFL and NASH, free insulin and IR deteriorated calculated by HOMA-IR and WBISI. However there was no significant difference between NAFLD and MS children concerning free insulin and IR.

And [Phe](brain) had more significant correlation with mental development than [Phe](blood).
There were no significant differences in the average overall scores for RTT patients with mutations in the region of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) compared with those mutations in the transcription repression domain (TRD) and C terminal segment (CTS), also patients with nonsense mutations compared with missense mutations, frameshift mutations and large deletions (P &gt; 0.05). The RTT patients with nonsense mutations located in the region of MBD have more severe phenotype than those with missense mutations in the same region (P = 0.016). Among p.T158M, p.R168X, c.806delG and p.R255X, there were no significant differences in the average overall scores (P &gt; 0.05), but there were significant differences in language skill (P = 0.028) and in language impairment rate at different level (P = 0.019).
Four children had mild/moderate active Crohn's disease. Six had severe active disease. The most common presenting symptom in CD was abdominal pain (80%, 8/10). One child had intestinal perforation; 2 had obstruction. Anal fistula was found in 2 patients. There were 5 mild, 14 moderate and 5 severe diseases in UC group. Diarrhea (23/24, 96%) was the most common symptom. Three children with UC suffered from perianal diseases. One had chronic intussusception. ESR and C reactive protein values were significantly higher in patients with CD compared with patients with UC (chi(2) = 15.938, P &lt; 0.01; chi(2) = 11.184, P &lt; 0.01). The pattern of anatomic involvement in CD was: ileocolic 60%, colon 10% and small bowel 30%.

A total of 15 infants were included in this series. Of them, 11 were preterm infants who were at gestational ages of 29 to 34 weeks and 4 infants were full-term. All of the 4 full term infants presented with progressive ventricular dilatation after suffering from the intra-cranial hemorrhage (3 infants were due to vitamin K deficiency and 1 was due to birth trauma). Thirteen infants had grade III IVH, and 2 had grade IV IVH based on initial cranial ultrasonographic and CT scans. The mean age when IVH was diagnosed was (9 +/- 1) days in preterm infants and (22 +/- 7) days in full-term infants; the mean age when Ommaya reservoir was placed was (18 +/- 11) days in preterm infants and (31 +/- 7) days in full-term infants. All the infants tolerated the surgical procedure well. The Ommaya reservoir was tapped for an average of (21.5 +/- 4.6) times per patient. The mean CSF volume per tap was (10.2 +/- 1.3) ml/kg. The values of CSF protein, glucose and cell counts slowly reached normal levels at approximately 3 - 5 weeks after the placement of the reservoir. The velocity of head circumference increase per week was less than 1 cm in 13 patients in 1 - 4 weeks after the placement of the reservoir and the size of ventricles decreased gradually. By 12 - 18 months, 12 infants had normal size ventricles, and 1 patient still had mild ventricular dilation at 36 months. Two infants developed progressive hydrocephalus after serial CSF aspiration through Ommaya reservoir. One infant had a V-P shunt placed at 2 months of age and another infant died at 3 months of age at home after parents refused further therapy. Complications consisted of reservoir leaking and CSF infection at 16th day of placement in one patient after repeated tapping. By the end of 18 - 36 months of follow-up, 11 of 14 infants were considered normal, two patients had mild impairment in neurodevelopmental outcome (both had spastic bilateral lower limbs paresis, and one of whom also had amblyopia) and the other had seizure disorder.
The 3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 97th smoothed percentiles and -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3 SD values and curves of weight-for-age, length/height-for-age and head circumference-for-age for boys and girls aged 0-7 years were made out respectively. The Chinese child growth charts was slightly higher than the WHO child growth standards.
Till April 30th 2007, 13/14 patients survived. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range: 7 months-115 months). The 10-year overall survival (OS) was 88.9%+/-10.5%, and the 10-year disease-free-survival (DFS) was 72.2%+/-13.8%; 3/14 patients had disease relapse, the median time to relapse from initial diagnosis was 23 months (range: 16-30 months). One patient developed second malignancy. No therapy related death was documented.
The diagnosis was WAS: WASP (-IVS9+2T&gt;C, WASP-negative). The patient received busulfan/cyclophosphamide 9 days before the transplantation. WBC decreased to 0.1x10(9)/L in d+4; The absolute number of neutrophils (ANC) was 0.8x10(9)/L in d+13, and exceeded 1.0x10(9)/L later on. From d(-9)-d+14 the patient was dependent on platelet transfusion. From d+15 the patient's PLT&gt;50x10(9)/L and returned to normal after d+30. In d+9-d+10 mild GVHD (I degree) occurred but subsided after the steroid treatment. From d+50, WASP was detected positive and STR showed full donor DNA chimera. Follow-up for 510 d post-transplant, the patient suffered only from mild cold twice, no eczema, no bleeding occurred. The PLT is normal and no chronic GVHD occurred. The levels of IgG, IgM and IgA of the patient were approximately normal.
In this study, ten mutations were identified in 27 of 28 Chinese patients. Most of them were located in exons 3 and 4 (91.3%). We detected four mutations reported, which were 609G&gt;A (W203X), 217C&gt;T (R73X), 271dupA (R91KfsX14), and 394C&gt;T (R132X), and six novel mutations, which were 1A&gt;G, 365A&gt;T, 658_660delAAG, 301-3_327del 30, 567_568insT, and 625_626insT. The 609G&gt;A (W203X) is the most common mutation, which was detected in 30 of 56 alleles (53.6%), including 10 homozygote mutations and 10 heterozygote mutations. In addition, three gene polymorphisms were detected, namely, -302T&gt;G (rs3748643), -234A&gt;G (rs3728644), and 321G&gt;A (rs2275276). These mutations include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, duplication, deletions, and insertions.
Compared to normal control, in STZ-induced diabetic rats, the levels of serum TC, TG, LDL, oxLDL and sICAM-1 were all increased (P&lt;0.01 for all), meanwhile LOX-1 and ICAM-1 expression (protein and mRNA) in the endothelium layers of abdominal aortas were also markedly enhanced (P&lt;0.01 for all); while in taurine supplemented rats, the levels of serum TG (0.64+/-0.12 vs. 0.97+/-0.18), TC (0.82+/-0.18 vs. 1.01+/-0.23), oxLDL (3.1+/-0.6 vs. 4.2+/-0.6), sICAM-1 (108.3+/-18.0 vs. 130.7+/-17.4), expression of LOX-1 and ICAM-1 protein (1.02+/-0.19 vs. 2.60+/-0.33, 1.21+/-0.22 vs. 2.98+/-0.31) as well as mRNA (0.45+/-0.09 vs. 0.96+/-0.15, 0.50+/-0.07 vs. 0.87+/-0.16) were all markedly lower than those of untreated diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05 for all). Also, the level of LOX-1 protein expression was positively correlated with levels of serum oxLDL (r=0.922, P=0.001), sICAM-1 (r=0.753, P=0.031) and ICAM-1 expression on abdominal aorta (r=0.849, P=0.008).
(1) TB patients and controls showed different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution patterns (58%, 36%). MCP-1 alleles -2518G was associated with increased TB susceptibility (P&lt;0.01). (2) The -2518 GG genotypes was associated with increased TB susceptibility (32% in TB patients and 13% in non-TB controls respectively, P&lt;0.01). (3) The odds of developing TB in genotypes GG were higher than those in homozygous AA, and the risk was higher in children than in adult (7.0-fold in children and 5.1-fold in adults, respectively). (4) Cases of homozygous GG had the highest plasma levels of MCP-1, which increased the likelihood of developing TB. Furthermore, higher levels were observed in children than in adults.
The retinal vasculature of the rats began to develop after birth, grew to most of the retinae on the 7th day, and was developed around 20th day. There was a large area of persistent central retinal vaso-obliteration in the retinal vasculature in rats after exposure to hyperoxia for 7 days, and the developed vessels were distorted. Hyperoxia induced neovascularization occurred on the 10th day and reached maximum neovascular response on d 14. The result of HE staining showed that the highest number of neovascular nuclei per cross section extending into the vitreous in hyperoxia model was seen on d 14 as compared with that of the same age of control groups and subretinal hematocele was observed in hyperoxia model of d 10 group. The expression of ang-2 in control group was the strongest in the retina on the 7th day, and was the least on the 20th day. In hyperoxia group, the expression of ang-2 on the 7th day was the weakest, the optical density value (OD value) was 82.106 62+/-6.302 40, significantly less than that of the age-matched normoxia control group, 115.448 33+/-9.373 10, and lower than that of hyperoxia model d 10, 124.425 95+/-10.572 09, and d 14, 117.685 20+/-10.578 48 (P&lt;0.001). After the rats had been returned to room air for 3 days, the expression of ang-2 increased significantly and reached the peak on d10, it's OD value was 110.07 039+/-12.59 962, the result had significant difference as compared with the age-matched control group, 124.42 595+/-10.572 09 (P&lt;0.05) and this strong expression remained till d 14 in model group.
Totally 96 preterm infants were recruited: HP 34, MP 32 and LP 30. There were no significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics among the 3 groups. HP group showed lower postnatal weight loss (43.4 g, 95% CI 74.3, 12.6) and weight loss% (2.84%, 95% CI 4.79%, 0.71%) than LP group. HP group showed shorter length of stay in NICU (5.25 d), days to reach 2000 g (7.03 d) and days to tolerate 100 kcal/(kg.d) enteral nutrition (4.52 d) than LP group. Cost of hospitalization was significantly lower in HP group than in LP group (-6275 RMB, 1 US$=8 RMB) and MP group (-5715 RMB). Mean serum RBP (D4), threonine and tyrosine levels were significantly higher in HP group than in LP group. Serum insulin levels were similar; mean serum glucose level was lower in HP group than in LP group. HP infants had lower incidence of sepsis than LP infants (21.9% vs 40.0%). There were no significant differences in the levels of blood ammonia, acid-base balance (as determined by pH and NaHCO3-), BUN, Cr, AST, and ALT.
There were 15 patients with CS, and all these cases were from 59 patients with extremities crush injury. The incidence of CS reached 15.3% in pediatric trauma victims after earthquake and 25.4% in extremities crush injury. Six risk factors were assessed with logistic regression analysis for three outcomes relating to crush syndrome, they are age, time being szeged and closed CI, whose log-odds ratio (log-OR) respectively was 1.049, 1.221, and 0.068 (P &lt; 0.05 for all). And no correlation was found between CS and gender, upper or lower limbs injury or wound infection. There was no significant difference in wounds infection rate between patients with open injury and those who underwent CS fasciotomy (P = 0.754), but there was significant difference between those patients who underwent CS fasciotomy and those who underwent other operative incisions (P &lt; 0.05). Wound infection had a significant association with severity of CS (P = 0.041) as compared with other factors such as age, gender, and time being szeged.
In the fifty injured children with wound infection, microbial growth was detected in 31 (62.0%) and 21 children suffered from mixed infections (the infection rate was 67.7%). Ninety-nine pathogens were isolated, gram positive bacteria accounted for 16.16% (16 strains), Gram negative bacteria accounted for 81.82% (81 strains), and fungus 2.02% (2 strains). Staphylococcus aureus (5 strains, 5.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (3 strains, 3.03%) and Enterococcus faecium (2 strains, 2.02%) were the primary Gram-positive bacteria identified and Gram-negative infections typically included Acinetobacter baumanii (27 strains, 27.27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18 strains, 18.18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 strains, 13.13%). Acinetobacter baumanii was the most common organism isolated from wounds. Duration of being szeged and complications had a significant association with wound infection with Acinetobacter baumanii. Drug sensitivity tests displayed that the isolated bacteria were highly resistant to common antibiotics. One strain of Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus complex and six strains of Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to all common antibiotics including imipenem/cilastatin. Vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria were not identified.
The most common symptoms were continuous fever (69/70) and myoclonic jerk (67/70). The fewer the rashes were, the more severe the patient's condition was, heart rate &gt;200/min, hypertension, increase of white blood cells in peripheral blood and hyperglycemia were common in patients with lesions in brain stem and pulmonary edema. There were no relations between patient's conditions and CSF white blood cells and CRP. CNS involvement was highly associated with EV71 infection. There were 69 cases in group A, B and C in total and all recovered. Of 11 patients in group D, 6 got complicated neurogenic pulmonary edema and circulatory failure, 2 cases died and 9 cases survived, 8 cases recovered without sequelae while one case had sequelae of mental retardation and dyscinesia.
All the 8 cases showed poliomyelitis-like syndrome. MRI of spinal cord showed unilateral or bilateral hyperintense lesions which chiefly occurred in the anterior horn regions of the spinal cord (C(2)-C(7) or T(12)-L(1)) on T(1)/T(2)-weighted images. Lesions of spinal cord chiefly occurred in T(12)-L(1). Most of the cases showed mild paralysis, which occurred in more than half of cases in single lower extremity. The patients who had acute paralysis of single lower extremity recovered faster than those with paralysis of four limbs.
The conjoined region located at the lumbosacral spine of which anteroposterior diameter was 7.9 cm, and 6.0 cm for cranial-caudal diameter. Spina bifida were found below L3 in bilateral twins. There were no bone structures but cartilage fusion in spine and pelvis. The neural structure such as spinal cord and cauda equina, lower GI tract and anus, and urinary tract were separated. The dural sac were fused. There were cryptorchidism in one twin, patent ductus arteriosus in both twins. The intraoperative finding matched with imaging results. Crossing V-shaped skin flap was used to cover the wound surface. The dura of conjoined twins were sutured. Successful separation of the PCT was achieved. There were no complications of infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and neurological deficit. The healing of the skin flap was good. With 6 months follow-up, the growth and neurological function were normal.
(1) Totally 327 cases of childhood B-ALL were screened for antibody combinations of interest and 88.4 percent of them (289 cases) were identified with effective antibody combinations. (2) The occurrence frequencies of antigen combinations were different. The highest frequency was seen with TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 combination which was 70.59 percent. Expressions of antigen combinations in Chinese children were different from those in western countries. (3) Some antibody combinations presented different frequency among different clinical groups. CD38/CD10/CD34/CD19 was expressed more often in samples of relapsed patients (P = 0.045). CD66c/CD10/CD34/CD19 expression was significantly higher in BCR/ABL positive group (P = 0.037) and relapsed patients group (P = 0.047). TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 was expressed more in MLL-AF4 negative group (P = 0.005) and Prednisone Good Response group (P = 0.002). CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19 was correlated with low relapse rate (P = 0.032).
(1) Birth length of Chinese children was about 50 cm, average length 61 cm, 67 cm, 76 cm and 88 cm at the 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th month. Height gain was stable from 2 to 10 years of age, average 6 - 7 cm each year. Birth length doubles by 3.5 years, and triples by 12 years. The formula estimating average height of normal children aged 2 - 10 years was, height (cm) = age (yr) x 6.5 + 76 (cm). (2) Birth weight was about 3.3 kg. Growth velocity was at peak about 1.0 - 1.1 kg/mon in the first 3 months, decreased by half and was about 0.5 - 0.6 kg/mon in the second 3 months, and was reduced by a quarter, which was about 0.25 - 0.30 kg/mon, in the last 6 months of the first year. Body mass was up to doubles, triples and quadruple of birth weight at about the 3rd, 12th and 24th month. Average annual gain was about 2 kg and 3 kg from 1 - 6 years and 7 - 10 years, respectively. The estimated formula for children 1 to 6 years of age was weight (kg) = age (yr) x 2 + 8 (kg), but for those 7 - 10 years old, weight (kg) = age (yr) x 3 + 2 (kg).
During the period between 2002 and 2006, 420 articles were published, and the average was 8.1 papers per project, which included 56 papers that were published in journals indexed by SCI (the average was 1.1 papers per project). The completion of general project was better than that of "the Young Researchers Fund" and small grant project. Ten post-doctors, 102 doctors and 109 masters were trained. Two projects were awarded with the first grade prize and another 2 with the second grade prize at the provincial and ministerial level, 4 items applied for patent and 1 was granted. These completed projects, which were mainly related to 7 of 12 subspecialties in the field of pediatrics, such as the respiratory disease, nephrology, neurology, cardiology, endocrinology, hematology, neonatology, are the major portion of the application projects and subsidized projects funded by NSFC, and achieved great research progresses.
The positive rate of PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium of pain patients were with 64% (14/22) in adenomyosis and 67% (10/15) in uterine fibroids. And their density were 0.6 (0 - 9.4)/mm(2) and 0.6 (0 - 6.0)/mm(2) without reaching statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05). No expression of NF could be detected in the functional layer of endometrium of adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. There were no PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium in non-pain women with adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. Moreover, No NF immunoreactive nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium were shown in non-pain patients with adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers and the nerve density in the basal layer of endometrium were 64% (14/22), 1.1 (0 - 12.0)/mm(2) in pain adenomyosis and 50% (5/10), 0.6 (0 - 3.0)/mm(2) in non-pain adenomyosis. NF immunoreactive nerve fibers and the density in the basal layer of endometrium were 23% (5/22), (0 - 0.6)/mm(2) in pain adenomyosis and 20% (2/10), (0 - 1.0)/mm(2) in non-pain adenomyosis. PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers and the nerve density in the basal layer of endometrium were 80% (12/15) and 1.6 (0 - 10.0)/mm(2) in pain fibroids and 44% (12/27), 0 (0 - 5.0)/mm(2) in non-pain fibroids. NF immunoreactive nerve fibers and the nerve density in the basal layer of endometrium were 40% (6/15), 0 (0 - 0.4)/mm(2) in pain fibroids and 15% (4/27), 0 (0 - 1.0)/mm(2) in non-pain fibroids. There was no statistical different PGP9.5 and NF immunoreactive nerve fibers distribution in basal layer of endometrium between pain adenomyosis and pain fibroids or between non-pain adenomyosis and non-pain fibroids (all P &gt; 0.05). However, PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers density in basal layer of endometrium was higher in pain adenomyosis and fibroids when compared with non-pain adenomyosis and fibroids (P &lt; 0.05).
(1) Clinical characteristics: The incidence of patients with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, straining feeling in anus, chronic pelvic pain and the level of CA(125) (&gt; 35 kU/L) was remarkably higher in moderate-to-severe adhesion groups than in none-to-mild adhesions groups (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.001, 0.006 and 0.000, respectively). Infertility rate were significantly higher in severe adhesions group (15.7%, 31/198) than none adhesions group (3.2%, 1/31), mild adhesions group (11.4%, 14/123) and moderate adhesions group (9.7%, 30/310, OR = 1.728, P &lt; 0.05). (2) Operating time and blood loss: Operating time of each groups was as followed: (37 +/- 15) min in none adhesions group, (42 +/- 19) min in mild adhesions group, (50 +/- 20) min in moderate adhesions group and (63 +/- 22) min in severe adhesion group. Blood loss was (23 +/- 12) ml in none adhesion group, (31 +/- 27) ml in mild adhesion group, (40 +/- 32) ml in moderate adhesion group and (70 +/- 67) ml in severe adhesions group. Thicker adhesions result in longer operation time and more blood loss. (3) Combined with other disease: The ratio of patients who combined with adenomyosis or deeply infiltrating endometriosis in moderate-to-severer adhesion groups was higher than patients in none-to-mild adhesions groups (OR = 3.466, P = 0.000). (4) Postoperative recurrence: It was categorized into recurrence of pain and cyst. Moderate-to-severe adhesions was related to higher recurrence rate of pain (OR = 1.685, P = 0.046), but was irrelevant to recurrence of cyst.

The sensitivity and specificity of BMI increase per week in predicting SPE was 84% and 81% at a cut-off value of 0.39 kg/(m(2).w)(-1), respectively, and 79% and 91% at 0.41 kg/(m(2).w)(-1) correspondingly. (3) During the third trimester and before the onset of SPE, the weight gain per week in the study group was higher than that of the control [(0.93 +/- 0.70) kg vs (0.63 +/- 0.20) kg, P &lt; 0.01]. Significant difference was also found in the net weight gain between the two groups (P &lt; 0.01), but not in the percentage of women with excessive weight gain (&gt; 0.50 kg/w) [60% (25/42) in the study group vs 63% (53/84) in the control group, P &gt; 0.05]. (4) Higher percentage of women experienced pre-hypertension in the study group than in the controls [17% (8/47) vs 5% (5/94), P &lt; 0.01].

The fascia on the ischial spine was firm and strong, with a thickness of 3 about mm. No major vessels or nerves were observed on the ischial spine. The greatest pullout strengths of the sacrospinous ligament, the fascia on the ischial spine, the iliococcygeus fascia as well as the vaginal fornix were (102 +/- 26), (64 +/- 15), (33 +/- 8) and (32 +/- 6) N, respectively.
(1) Immunohistochemical staining showed that positive staining of integrin beta3 and OPN were present predominantly in eutopic and ectopic endometrial glandular epithelium. There was significant different protein expression of integrin beta3 and OPN, which were 1.6 +/- 0.8 and 1.7 +/- 0.7 in eutopic endometrium, 1.7 +/- 0.7 and 1.8 +/- 0.9 in ectopic endometrium, 2.1 +/- 0.9 and 2.0 +/- 0.9 in control endometrium (P &lt; 0.05). The protein expression of integrin beta3 and OPN in eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis in the proliferative phase (0.8 +/- 0.4 and 0.7 +/- 0.3) were remarkably lower than those of the secretory phase (1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.9 +/- 0.8, P &lt; 0.01). The protein expression of integrin beta3 and OPN in the endometrium of controls in the proliferative phase (1.0 +/- 0.4 and 1.0 +/- 0.4) were significantly lower than those of the secretory phase (2.5 +/- 0.7 and 2.5 +/- 0.7) (P = 0.000). In the mid-secretory phase, the protein expression of integrin beta3 (2.0 +/- 0.9) and OPN (2.1 +/- 0.8) in eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis were significantly lower than that of control endometrium (2.7 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 +/- 0.7) (P &lt; 0.01). (2) The mRNA expression level of integrin beta and OPN in eutopic and ectopic endometrium were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (result was shown by median index). It was observed that integrin beta3 mRNA and OPN mRNA were significantly lower in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis (4.69 and 4.23), when compared with ectopic endometrium (7.96 and 14.84) and controls (13.47 and 17.40) (P &lt; 0.05). Eutopic endometrium had higher mRNA expression of integrin beta and OPN mRNA in the secretory phase (5.54 and 11.40) than that in the proliferative phase (2.69 and 3.30) (P &lt; 0.01). The mRNA expression level of integrin beta and OPN of control endometrium in the proliferative phase (3.12 and 4.75) were significantly lower than that in the secretory phase (19.94 and 21.00, P = 0.000). The mRNA expression of integrin beta and OPN were 10.10 and 14.34 in the mid-secretory phase, which were significantly lower than 21.50 and 24.18 in control endometrium (P &lt; 0.05).
The laparoscopic anatomic nerve-sparing procedure was performed successfully and safely among all patients. (1) There was no remarkable difference in the following clinical parameters between LANSRH and LRH group: median operating time [(175 +/- 41) min vs. (178 +/- 30) min, P = 0.72], blood loss [(233 +/- 104) ml vs. (218 +/- 77) ml, P = 0.06], numbers of lymph nodes (13 +/- 4 vs. 15 +/- 6, P = 0.16), resected length of paracervix tissue [(3.6 +/- 0.5) cm vs. (3.7 +/- 0.6) cm, P = 0.43], resected length of vaginal tissue [(3.5 +/- 1.0)cm vs. (3.5 +/- 0.8) cm, P = 0.80]. (2) The mean time of the Foley catheter removed was (10.6 +/- 2.7) days (7 - 17 days) in LANSRH group and (17.2 +/- 4.2) days (9 - 25 days) in LRH group (P = 0.02). After Foley catheter removed, 95% (35/37) presented bladder fulfilling sense, 86% (32/37) presented automatic micturition and urination emptying in LANSRH group. However, In LRH group, 88% (22/25) presented bladder fulfilling sense, 76% (19/25) presented automatic micturition and urination emptying. The bladder void function recovery were 68% (25/37) in class 0 and 3% (1/37) in class II in LANSRH group, when compared with 40% (10/25) in class 0 and 12% (3/25) in class II in LRH group, it reached statistical difference (P &lt; 0.05). In the mean time, there was no significant difference in Class I bladder void function recovery, which were 24% (9/37) and 48% (12/25). (3) No surgery complications and blood transfusion were observed in LANSRH and LRH group. Postoperative pathology suggested that no tumor cell invasion occurred in paracervix tissue and lymph nodes. During the range of 11 to 19 months follow-up, all patients were alive without tumor recurrence and metastasis.
The sentinel node was identified in 20 patients (95%), included 8 cases with unilateral SLNs and 12 cases with bilateral SLN. A total of 83 SLN were identified with a mean number of 4.2 per patient (range, 1 - 9) or 2.6 per groin (range, 1 - 6). Difference between the mean number of SLN (4.4 per patient, 2.5 per groin) identified by blue dye or by combined procedure (3.9 per patient, 2.7 per groin) was not statistically significant (t = 0.459, P = 0.652;t = -0.421, P = 0.717). Twenty patients were detected to positively superficial inguinal SLN and one of them also positively bilateral deep femoral SLN, 8 (10 groins) of them were detected positively nodal metastases. Among of eight patients, 7 (9 groins) of them were detected more than one SLN involved, while 1 of them were detected false-negative node involved. The false negative rate of was 10% (1/10), negative predictive value was 96% (22/23). No complications were attributed to the study.
The expression level of NICD in cervical cancers was significantly higher than that of normal cervical tissues (1.237 +/- 0.353 vs 0.938 +/- 0.105, P &lt; 0.05). The NICD expression was higher in cervical cancers with high grade, lymph node involvement and parametrial invasion than that with low-middle grade (1.496 +/- 0.540 vs 1.150 +/- 0.216), without lymph node involvement (1.419 +/- 0.532 vs 1.159 +/- 0.210) and no parametrial invasion (1.718 +/- 0.710 vs 1.183 +/- 0.258), respectively (all P &lt; 0.05). The expression of NICD in cervical adenocarcinoma was higher than that of squamous cell cancer (1.463 +/- 0.395 vs 1.162 +/- 0.187, P &lt; 0.05). After SiHa and HeLa cells were incubated with DAPT, NICD expression was significantly lower than that in control (P &lt; 0.05). The effects of DAPT inhibited the proliferation and prompted the apoptosis of SiHa and HeLa cells was depended on its concentrations and times.
Significant variation of proteomic profiling between pre-surgery and post-surgery were analyzed. There were 22 proteins with different mass/charge (M/Z) values significantly different (P &lt; 0.01) at the M/Z value range from 1500 to 50 000, among of which relative content of proteins with M/Z 3981, 4290, and 28 066 in pre-surgery cervical cancer patients were higher than those in health women [(1.51 +/- 1.78)% vs (0.83 +/- 0.38)%, (2.70 +/- 2.19)% vs (1.72 +/- 0.91)%, (1.99 +/- 1.70)% vs (0.92 +/- 0.95)%; P &lt; 0.01], while in the post-surgery patients, relative content of these three proteins significantly decreased to (0.59 +/- 0.45)%, (1.01 +/- 0.64)%, (0.54 +/- 0.37)%, respectively. But the relative content of another three proteins with M/Z 11 487, 11 529, and 11 678 were significantly increased in post-surgery patients [(0.38 +/- 1.41)% vs (2.74 +/- 3.67)%, (0.16 +/- 0.46)% vs (2.00 +/- 1.76)%, (1.02 +/- 1.67)% vs (7.71 +/- 9.46)%; P &lt; 0.01].
All treated eyes were followed up for 1 to 3 years. After the treatment, 7 eyes divorced from blindness with uncorrected visual acuity 20/200 (0.1), and 2 eyes among them got corrected visual acuity 20/30 (0.6). Two eyes with the questionable orientation of light perception before treatment gained uncorrected visual acuity 4/200 (0.02) and 8/200 (0.04) after treatment respectively. Complications were found to include 5 recurrent frontal membrane of keratoprosthesis, one back membrane of keratoprosthesis, and one limited corneal melting. Complications were controlled by the corresponding treatments, such as membrane resection for the recurrent frontal membrane of keratoprosthesis, courage under microscope for back membrane of keratoprosthesis, and reinforcement of acellular dermis for corneal melting. All keratoprosthesis were maintained in situ, and no rejection and leakage of aqueous humor happened.
Five reference strains and 40 of 42 (95.2%) clinical strains were correctly identified within 3 h post-PCR amplification while 2 other clinical strains were not identified because of their high background fluorescence intensity. Positive S/B ranged from 5.6 to 13.3. There was no significant difference between respective detection and mixed detection of 5 species (t = 0.2524, P = 0.8132). The sensitivity limit for this assay was determined to be 0.94 ng PCR products. The MFI presented positive correlation with amount of PCR products (r(s) = 1.0000, P &lt; 0.01). Coefficient variation of four repeated detections was 1.8% - 13.7%.
In these 22 cases, IT was (57.62 +/- 31.72) months; ID was (12.00 +/- 2.76) scores; II was (2.32 +/- 2.63) scores; BVA was (29.79% +/- 18.61%); BVC was (14.45 +/- 9.29) units; LVC was (2.73 +/- 4.57) units and PMN was (13.45 +/- 13.09) units. In 7 patients with IT more than 64 months (accounted for 32% of 22 cases), lymphangiogenesis [(8.6 +/- 3.8) units] and hemangiogenesis [(22.3 +/- 11.1) units] were both present. In these 7 patients, the whole number of LVC was 60 units, constituting 16% of all vessels (BVC+LVC = 378 units). The correlation coefficient of LVC with IT, ID, BVA, PMN and II was -0.673, 0.604, 0.755, 0.806 and 0.873, respectively. P value of all these correlations was less than 0.05. Further regression analysis revealed that LVC could be approximately calculated from II and BVA multiplying certain constant coefficients separately (resulting in lymphatic index, LI). Lymphatic vessels with characteristic ultrastructures and inflammatory cells were identified by transmission electronic microscopy.
The difference of the uncorrected distance, intermediate vision; the best-corrected distance, intermediate and near vision; intermediate vision after the distance vision corrected between the multifocal and monofocal groups was no statistical significance. The uncorrected near vision (0.82 +/- 0.20 vs 0.33 +/- 0.14, t = 8.99, P = 0.000) and the near vision after the distance vision corrected (0.83 +/- 0.17 vs 0.32 +/- 0.11, t = 9.83, P = 0.000) were statistically better in the multifocal group than the monofocal group. Photopic contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequency (18 c/d) and mesopic sensitivity with glare at medium frequency (6 c/d) was statistically lower in the multifocal group (P &lt; 0.05). The total aberration and spherical aberration of the multifocal group were smaller than the monofocal group (t = 3.74, P = 0.00; t = 3.56, P = 0.00). The spectacle independent rate of multifocal and monofocal group were 70.73% (29/41) and 8.33% (2/24) respectively (chi(2) = 23.63, P = 0.00). The mild and moderate glare and halo were existent in both groups (chi(2) = 0.50, P = 0.78).Moderate visual disturbances were reported 24% (12/50) in the multifocal group and 26.67% (8/30) in the monofocal group.No serious glare and halo phenomenon were reported.
After follow-up at 8 to 56 months, all reconstructed eyelids showed a normal appearance with good function and without deformities, e.g. eyelid notch, entropion and ectropion. There was no relapse of the eyelid tumor. All patients were satisfied with the results.
In the study population of 3764 Uygur students, 88 students had CVD, including 69 males and 19 females. 48 of 2055 Han students were diagnosed with CVD, including 46 males and 2 females. No significant difference existed in the prevalence of CVD in boys between two nationalities. The prevalence of CVD in Uygur girls was higher than that in Han girls.
Three hundred and fifty-six proteins were excised in conjunctivochalasis patients and 352 proteins in the normal controls, and among them 119 proteins were the same. The functions of tear proteins were classified with GOA, which found some apoptosis regulation proteins and apoptosis related proteins and inflammatory response related proteins in conjuntivochalasis but not in normal controls group. Defensin was also found in conjuntivochalasis.
Of the 785 specimens, 211 were culture positive. The percentage of positive culture was 26.88%. Of those positive cultures, 176 (83.41%) had pure bacterial infections, 32 (15.17%) had pure fungal infections, and 3 (1.42%) had pure cultures of Acanthamoeba. Of the 176 bacterial positive cultures, polymicrobial infection was present in 38 cases (33 bacterial, 5 fungal and bacterial). Of 214 bacterial isolates, the most common isolate was Neisseria gonorrhoeae (39/214, 18.22%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (37/214, 17.29%), and Corynebacterium spp. (36/214, 16.82%). The most common fungal pathogen isolated was Fusarium spp. representing 25.00% (8/32) of all positive fungal cultures, followed by Aspergillus spp. (15.63%, 5/32). The sensitivity of tobramycin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, rifampicin and levofloxacin of bacteria was 62.57%, 64.94%, 70.06%, 70.87%, 71.19%, 73.89%, 85.80% and 87.50%. Gram-positive isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. Gram-negative isolates showed high susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin. The fungal isolates were most susceptible to natamycin, followed by terbinafine, but resistant to fluconazole.
(1) The bodies of RAPA liposome were intact kinds of spheres, the average diameter was 145.2 nm, and the envelopment rate was 90.02%. (2) After the burn of 14 d, CNV area of B, C, D and E group were (28.289 +/- 0.703), (28.005 +/- 0.801), (20.002 +/- 1.005) and (22.300 +/- 0.853) mm(2) (F = 159.62, P &lt; 0.05). The CNV of both the rapamycin liposome treated group and the rapamycin solved in bean oil group grew slowly and smaller than that of blank liposome treated group and blank treated group (q = 47.80, 46.20, 34.60, 32.90;P = 0.00). While the rapamycin liposome treated group changed more obviously than the rapamycin solved in bean oil group (q = 13.20, P = 0.00). After alkali burn, the expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF increased dramatically, meanwhile the expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF were significantly decreased by RAPA.
Treatment with EGF did not obviously change the cell morphology. EGF significantly induced the proliferation of RCE cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In cells treated with different concentrations of EGF, the proliferation rate of 5, 10, 25 and 50 microg/L EGF group at 72 h were 9.0%, 23.5%, 20.8% and 17.7%, respectively. The difference was statistically significant as compared with the control group (F = 45.48, P &lt; 0.01). EGF at 10 microg/L showed maximally stimulating effect. After EGF treatment for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, the expression of cyclinD1 and CDK4 proteins was markedly increased (cyclinD1/beta-actin ratio was 0.253, 0.591, 0.885 and 1.043; CDK4/beta-actin ratio was 0.422, 0.588, 0.804 and 1.241 at different periods, respectively). Furthermore, p27 protein expression was significantly inhibited by EGF (p27/beta-actin ratio was 0.225, 0.163, 0.107 and 0.082 after EGF treatment for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively). However, there was no detectable difference in p21 and p18 protein expression between EGF treatment and control groups (p21/beta-actin ratio was 0.432, 0.391, 0.407 and 0.329 and p18/beta-actin ratio was 0.268, 0.274, 0.231 and 0.309, respectively).
After alkali burn, TGF-beta1 was first expressed in the cornea stroma. Then, some stroma cells expressed both alpha-SMA and FAP. The FAP(+) keratocytes were found surrounding the CD31(+) endothelium of angiogenesis. RT-PCR study showed that FAP mRNA was only present in neovascularized cornea and not in normal cornea. Polarization microscopy revealed that the collagen types I and III were rearranged in neovascularized cornea.
The purification rate of RGC reached 96.24% after cultured for 12 hours. Compared with the control group, the growth and survival times of RGC were similar (P = 0.595, 0.147) under the pressure of 20 mm Hg cultured for 48 hours, the expression of NF-H in RGC was not different (P = 0.227); but the growth and survival times of RGC were significantly different (P = 0.001, 0.000, 0.000 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.000) under the pressures of 40, 60, and 80 mm Hg, respectively. The expression of NF-H in RGC were significantly (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.000) reduced under the pressures of 40, 60, and 80 mm Hg for 48 hours respectively.
Compared to group A and B, the expression of CTGF was significantly increased at day 5 after surgery (F = 19.54, P &lt; 0.05) in group C, D, and E. The expression of CTGF mRNA in group C is significantly higher than that in group D at day 2 and 5 (t = 2.300, 5.140, P &lt; 0.05), while group D is significantly higher than that in group E at day 2, 5, 7, and 14 (t = -2.927, -6.424, -4.176, -4.997, P &lt; 0.05). The expression of CTGF protein in group C is significantly higher than that in group D (t = -7.147, -10.955, -9.900, -6.385, P &lt; 0.05), and group D is higher than that in group E (F = 68.33, P &lt; 0.05) at day 2, 5, 7, and 14, respectively. Inflammatory reaction reached peak at day 5 after surgery in group C, D, and E showing an infiltration of neutrophil, monocytes, macrophages, and the proliferation of fibroblast.
Knockdown of Wnt5a in gastric cancer cells reduced the number of liver metastases that formed in nude mice. Microarray analyses indicated that Wnt5a activity induced expression of the gene encoding laminin gamma2, a subunit of the epithelial basement membrane protein laminin-5. Wnt5a induced the expression of laminin gamma2 through the activation of protein kinase C and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase. The invasive activity of gastric cancer cells depended on laminin gamma2; Wnt5a expression levels correlated with those of laminin gamma2 in diffuse-scattered type gastric tumor samples from patients.
Sadness ratings increased significantly following negative mood induction (P &lt; .01). There was no significant effect of emotion on subjective perception of painful and nonpainful stimulation (P &gt; .05). Following painful stimulation, brain activity increased in the right hemisphere during negative emotion and was localized to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA24/32), anterior insula, and inferior frontal gyrus. Following nonpainful stimulation during negative emotion, brain activity increased in the right anterior insula and ACC (BA24 and 32).
There were 17 cases of IBD-related TE treated with local thrombolysis grouped as follows: 7 of cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 of lower extremity arterial TE, 1 of deep vein thrombosis, 1 of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, 3 of abdominal vein thrombosis, and 2 of inferior vena cava TE. Mean age was 32 (range, 14 to 50) years, and 13 of 17 patients were female. Twelve had ulcerative colitis, 3 had Crohn's disease, and 1 was indeterminate. Four of the 7 patients with active IBD had pretreatment hematochezia, 2 of whom had worsening of hematochezia secondary to treatment. The rates of radiologic resolution, clinical resolution, and hemorrhagic complications in the IBD patients were favorable in all the anatomic areas and were very similar to non-IBD patients.
Pretreatment abnormal TSH levels (TSH&gt;3.0 mU/L or &lt;0.4 mU/L) were detected in 15.6% and occurred significantly more often in females (24.6%; P=0.018). TA could be detected only in 2.6%, NOSA in up to 29.9% (47.4% females vs. 24.2% males). During CIFN induction therapy, low TSH levels were detected in 14.1% whereas elevated TSH levels occurred later (week 48) in up to 15.5%, again preferentially in females (42%, P=0.005). In 1.4% of all patients, treatment had to be discontinued because of symptomatic hyperthyroidism. TAs were detected in 10.5% (30.5% females) and NOSA up to 58% during CIFN treatment.
Fifteen patients presented without LCI or with LCI Child- Pugh A, 15/4 patients had LCI Child-Pugh B/C. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage was B/C/D in 4/22/8 patients. During treatment period (median 2.2 mo), therapy was discontinued in 61.8% of patients due to tumor progression (32.3%), death (17.6%), AEs (8.8%), or noncompliance (2.9%). Most common grade 3/4 AEs included liver dysfunction (23.5%), diarrhea (14.7%), increased lipase (8.8%), fatigue (8.8%), and hand-foot skin reaction (5.9%). Worsening liver dysfunction/failure was more frequent (P=0.036) in patients with LCI Child-Pugh B/C compared with patients with maintained liver function (no LCI/LCI Child-Pugh A). Median overall survival was 7.2 months for patients with maintained liver function versus 3.3/3.4 months for patients with LCI Child-Pugh B/C.
We only found slight differences between alcohol and tobacco concerning professionals' behaviour. Professionals declared to assist more often patients with alcohol risk consumption than smoking (36.4% vs 10.9% [p&lt;.0001]) although with patients those differences haven't been confirmed. They just told to have been asked more often about alcohol consumption than about smoking (43.6% vs 30.8% [p&lt;.05]). There were no differences after the training sessions.
Verbal learning (p&lt;0.001), immediate visual memory (p&lt;0.05), attentional resources management (p&lt;0.05), phonologic fluency (p&lt;0.01), abstraction (p&lt;0.001), complex problem-solving (p&lt;0.05) and mental flexibility (p&lt;0.05) are the functions most affected by cocaine use.
46.5% of the patients take BZ, and of these, 60% are over age 45. The most widely used of these is alprazolam (p&lt;0.001), and 70% take just one active ingredient. The main prescriber is the general practitioner, and the most frequent indication is insomnia.
Internal consistency of the questionnaire was assessed (Cronbach's Alfa=0.91), as well as other reliability indicators. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis offers four- and five-factor solutions. Also tested were the dimensionality and structural model and its convergent and discriminant validity with other instruments. Differences between clinical and non-clinical individuals and total scores were also analyzed.
A total of 77 twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome placentas were included in the study. Residual anastomoses (n = 48) were found in 32% (25/77) of lasered placentas. Most residual anastomoses were localized near the margin of the placenta. The majority of residual anastomoses (67%; 32/48) were very small (diameter, &lt; 1 mm). Eleven of the 25 cases (44%) in the residual anastomoses group developed twin anemia-polycythemia sequence.
A total of 44 fetuses were diagnosed with fetal tachy- or bradyarrhythmia: 28 fetuses had supraventricular tachycardia (SVT); 7 fetuses had atrial flutter (AF), and 9 fetuses had atrioventricular block (AVB). The mortality rate was low (6%; 2/35 fetuses) in the SVT and AF groups and high in the AVB group (78%; 7/9 fetuses). Six patients were lost to follow-up evaluation (14%). Neurodevelopmental outcome was normal in all survivors in the SVT and AF groups, except for 1 patient who experienced plexus brachialis injury because of shoulder dystocia. Two of the 3 survivors in the AVB group had severe developmental delay.
Margin status and presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3+ in the cone were poor predictors of treatment outcome (sensitivity, &lt; 50%; diagnostic odds ratio, &lt;or= 2.5). Presence of high-/intermediate-risk human papillomavirus types predicted 100% of residual high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/cervical intraepithelial 2+ at a specificity of 73%. Testing only 13 high-risk types showed equal sensitivity but higher specificity (86%; P &lt; .01). Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus infection (13 types) detected high-grade residual disease with a sensitivity of 60% at a very high specificity (95%), resulting in a positive predictive value of 43%, which exceeded the positive predictive values of all other criteria.
Of the deliveries in which the mother had no previous LEEP, 18,519 deliveries (3.5%) were preterm; when this data were applied to 530 preterm deliveries (6.9%) that were subsequent to LEEP, the yield was a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery, with an odds ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.88-2.27; LEEP vs no LEEP).
Eight hundred fourteen (65%) women had GBS colonization sometime during the observation period. Rectal GBS colonization was the strongest predictor of vaginal colonization (adjusted odds ratio, 14.3; 95% CI, 11.9-17.1). Recent sexual intercourse, vaginal colonization with yeast, and a vaginal Nugent score &gt;/= 4 were also independent determinants of vaginal GBS colonization. Antimicrobial use decreased vaginal GBS colonization only among women who had no rectal colonization.
Mean gestational weight gain was 10.2 +/- 4.3 (SD) kg. Compared with the lowest quartile of weight gain, participants in the highest quartile had an increased odds of impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-5.15), but not gestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-1.70).
In saline solution-treated fetuses, glucose delivery was unchanged or increased in femoral and carotid circulations, respectively, during H1 and H2. In dexamethasone-treated fetuses, the increase in glucose delivery to the head tended to be greater during H1 and was significantly enhanced in dexamethasone- vs saline solution-treated fetuses during H2.
Before CI placement, the abdominal group had a total of 100 pregnancies that continued beyond the first trimester and had 27 (27%) surviving infants. After cerclage placement, there were 34 pregnancies and 24 (71%) surviving infants. Before cerclage placement, the vaginal group had a total of 90 pregnancies that continued beyond the first trimester and had 11 (12%) surviving infants. After cerclage placement, there were 29 pregnancies and 20 (69%) surviving infants. The vaginal cerclage group had a significantly shorter mean operative time of 33 vs 69 minutes, and shorter hospital stay of 0.5 vs 3.2 days.
Ninety-nine patients were included in the study group. Abnormal uterine artery Doppler group presented significantly lower gestational age at admission (36.1 +/- 2.1 weeks vs 37.2 +/- 1.9 weeks; P &lt; .005), lower gestational age at delivery (36.5 +/- 1.9 weeks vs 37.7 +/- 1.7 weeks; P &lt; .005), lower birthweight (2429 +/- 590 g vs 3013 +/- 597 g; P &lt; .0001), and a higher admission rate to neonatal intensive care unit (17/51 vs 6/48; odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.5). No significant difference in the occurrence of maternal complications (10/51 vs 6/48; odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-4.9) was registered.
EOS developed in 383 of 15,839 infants (2.42%). Fifty-five percent of pathogens isolated were gram-negative bacteria. Lack of prenatal care (odds ratio [OR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.86), delivery room resuscitation (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.91-3.24), membrane rupture &gt; 24 hours without amnionitis (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.53-2.88), amnionitis with membrane rupture &lt; 24 hours (OR, 4.28; 95% CI, 2.97-6.16), and amnionitis with membrane rupture &gt;or= 24 hours (OR, 8.15; 95% CI, 5.98-11.10) were associated with EOS, but not antenatal steroids or gestational age.
In all, 71% underwent total Prolift, 20% anterior, and 8% posterior alone. Average age was 62 years and mean follow-up was 8 months. The intraoperative visceral injury rate was 6.6%, mesh exposure rate was 3.8%, and recurrent failure rate was 5.2%. The postoperative de novo stress incontinence rate was 24.3%. In this series, 18% of women had pelvic muscle symptoms postoperatively; 74% of these resolved within 6 months with conservative management.
Subsurface visualization was more sensitive in detecting genital erythema and dryness at all sites whether or not symptoms were present. Subsurface inflammation of the introitus, vagina, and cervix only was detected uniquely in women with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS). A subset of women presenting with VVS exhibited subclinical inflammation of the vulva vestibule and vagina (designated VVS/lichen sclerosus subgroup).
Antenatal cofetal loss or death occurred in 3% of all cases of cerebral palsy, which is a small but significant contribution. The odds ratio for cerebral palsy in survivors of cofetal loss that included iatrogenic pregnancy reduction was 2.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-8.98), which gave a population-attributable proportion of 7.28% (95% CI, 0-27.5), compared with 4.25 (95% CI, 1.12-16.10) and 10.6% (95% CI, 1.0-35.6) for survivors of cofetal death.
Transvaginal ultrasound predicted adenomyosis with a likelihood ratio of 4.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.13-6.17). The overall prevalence of adenomyosis was 27.9% (95% CI, 25.5-30.3). The probability of adenomyosis with an abnormal transvaginal ultrasound was 66.2% (95% CI, 61.6- 70.6). The probability of adenomyosis with a normal transvaginal ultrasound was 9.1% (95% CI, 7.3-11.1).
Intramembranous sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, glucose, and lactate fluxes increased 2.5- to 7.9-fold, were linearly related to volume fluxes (r = 0.83-0.99), and were unaffected by lung liquid. All clearance rates, except that of lactate, increased to equal the intramembranous volume absorption rate during infusion.
Among eligible women who were offered participation, 90% accepted testing. The median time from blood draw to result available was faster for rapid testing (25 minutes) than conventional testing (23 hours; P &lt; .0001). For rapid tests, point-of-care testing was faster than laboratory-based testing (24 minutes vs 35 minutes; P &lt; .0001). Almost 96% of rapid test results were available within 1 hour.
Thirty-six patients were treated, 3 with positive paraaortic lymph nodes. The median follow-up interval was 32 months. Twenty-four patients (66.7%) had no evidence of disease at last follow-up. Thirteen patients (36.1%) had recurrence. Fifteen patients (41.7%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicity.
In 21.1% of parous women with a history of vaginal delivery, an avulsion of the levator muscle was diagnosed, and in 8.6% it was bilateral. The relative risk of abnormal distensibility was 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-6.5) in unilateral and 3.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-9.2) in bilateral avulsion. Avulsion increased muscle distensibility on Valsalva and reduced muscle shortening on pelvic floor muscle contraction.
Women who requested EC were more likely to have previously used EC (P &lt; .001), to have had unprotected sex in the past 6 months (P &lt; .001), to have experienced an unintended pregnancy in the past year (P = .009), and to perceive the need for EC use in the next 3 months (P &lt; .001) but were less likely to use hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device (P &lt; .001).
Surface plasmon resonance studies indicated scFv H6 to be the clone with the highest affinity against CLDN3 (K(D) of 23.60 nmol/L). scFv H6 efficiently stained CLDN3-expressing cells and recognized its epitope in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that was performed with uterine serous papillary carcinoma native protein extract, which suggested that a conformational epitope is recognized by this antibody. Cell surface immunofluorescence with laser scanning confocal microscopy confirmed the specific binding to the native membrane CLDN3.
In the cultured HUVEC supernatants, the addition of MaCL increased activated factor VII and prothrombin-fragment 1 + 2, did not modify UPA, and decreased activated factor XII and differentiating 2 chain UPA, in comparison with samples with control immunoglobulin M added. The MaCL without APS activity did not change any parameter that was evaluated.
A significant increase of viral load was found earlier from preinvasive to invasive groups compared with normal groups, except with clinical staging and clinical outcome. High occurrence of integrated HPV16 was observed in preinvasive (27/44 samples) and invasive cervical carcinoma (40/68 samples). Cervical progression was observed significantly in most preinvasive (18/27 samples) and invasive cases (25/40 samples) that were infected with integrated HPV. Integrated HPV16 with significant viral load can be used as a predictive marker for tumor progression in the early stage of invasive cervical carcinoma.
Isolated CHD in the fetus was associated with an increased risk of microcephaly as were tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation/aortic arch hypoplasia, and hypoplastic left ventricle syndrome. Tetralogy of Fallot odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.3; P &lt; .04 and coarctation/aortic arch hypoplasia, odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.1; P &lt; .001 were significant independent predictors of microcephaly.
The estimated African ancestral proportion was 0.90 +/- 0.13. We found significant associations of ancestral proportion with PTD as a whole and PTD subgrouped by the presence of maternal hypertensive disorders. We did not observe significant confounding as a result of population stratification in this case-control PTD study.
Performance of first-trimester screening more than doubled from 2001-2007 (43.1% in 2001, 97.3% in 2007; P &lt; .0001). Between 2001 and 2007, the use of the quad screen increased 10-fold (8.5% in 2001, 85.6% in 2007; P &lt; .0001). There was an estimated 20% decrease in invasive diagnostic procedures that were performed in risk-positive women (53.7% in 2001, 34.2% in 2007; P &lt; .0001). In 2007, the average fetal loss rates that were quoted by maternal-fetal medicine specialists after chorionic villous sampling was 1:160 and after an amniocentesis was 1:493.
Neonates with congenital hypothyroidism had significantly higher rates of reduced variability in FHR tracing patterns as compared with those without congenital hypothyroidism (49.2% vs 3.8%; odds ratio, 24.1; 95% confidence interval, 6.8-85.3; P &lt; .001). No significant differences were noted between the groups regarding decelerations or baseline abnormalities. The significant association between congenital hypothyroidism and reduced variability persisted after controlling for confounders such as treatment with pethidine, MgSO4, and gestational age (odds ratio, 14.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-190.7; P = .046).
Thirty-three thousand nine hundred twenty-six pairs were analyzed. PTBs between 20-36 completed weeks occurred in 59.1% MM pairs and 57.5% FF pairs. MM sex was an independent risk factor for PTB. This effect was greatest for deliveries between 20-29 weeks (hazard ratio, 1.224; 95% CI, 1.113-1.346). The effect was most pronounced in non-Hispanic white MM pairs.
Three hundred seventy-nine women (27%) were overweight (body mass index &gt;or= 26 kg/m(2)) and 703 (51%) experienced excessive GWG, according to Institute of Medicine guidelines. In multivariable logistic regression models, we found that intake of total energy (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.22, per 500 kcal/d), dairy (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17, per serving per day), and fried foods (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 0.91-13.24, per serving per day) were directly associated with excessive GWG. First trimester vegetarian diet (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.78) and midpregnancy walking (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.01, per 30 minutes per day) and vigorous physical activity (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97, per 30 minutes per day) were inversely associated with excessive GWG.
More fetuses with CHD showed variant FHR than did control fetuses (46.6% vs 17.7%; P &lt; .01). Cesarean section deliveries that were based on fetal indications were performed more frequently in fetuses with CHD than in control fetuses (12.9% vs 3.2%; P &lt; .01). Isomerism and tetralogy of Fallot were observed frequently with variant FHR. When chromosomal abnormalities and intrauterine growth restriction were excluded, the fetuses with CHD showed more variant FHR than did the control fetuses.
LAM trauma was observed in 39 of 210 (18.8%) patients and no controls. Odds ratio for LAM trauma when newborn HC &gt;or= 35.5 cm was 3.343 (95% confidence interval, 1.33-8.42); when second stage duration &gt;or= 110 minutes, odds ratio was 2.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.81). Logistic regression showed that HC &gt;or= 35.5 and second stage duration &gt;or= 110 minutes increased odds of LAM trauma by a factor of 5.32.
The expected birthweight at 40.0 weeks for a standard-size primiparous mother of European origin in an uncomplicated pregnancy was 3453.4 g, very similar to the standardized birthweight observed in other populations. Physiological coefficients were derived for maternal height, weight, parity, ethnic origin, and sex of the baby. Smoking, history of preterm delivery, and hypertensive diseases in the current pregnancy all had negative effects on birthweight, whereas babies of diabetic mothers weighed more. Low as well as high body mass index was associated with birthweight deficit at term.
Compared with SGA by the birthweight standard, SGA by customized growth potential showed higher risk for each of the 6 adverse indicators. A third of the SGA group was small by customized centiles but not by population-based centiles, yet was strongly associated with each of the pregnancy complications studied. This subgroup of unrecognized SGA babies included 26% preterm deliveries. In contrast, a subgroup that was SGA by the population standard but not by the customized standard (17.2%), was not associated with any of the indicators of adverse outcome.
Prepregnancy BMI modified the relationship between weight gain and LGA. Lean women had higher odds of LGA than overweight or obese women for weight gain &gt;or= 36 lb. For macrosomia, prepregnancy BMI did not modify the association. Compared with women who gained 15-25 lb, the aOR for a gain of 26-35 lb was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.9), for a gain of 36-45 lb was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.7-2.7), and for a gain of &gt;or= 46 lb was 3.9 (95% CI, 3.0-5.0).
Compared with women who gained 15-25 lbs during pregnancy, women who gained 1-14 lbs had 1.5 greater odds (95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.8) of SGA for the most restrictive definition and 1.2 greater odds (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4) for the least restrictive definition, after adjustments for confounders. Depending upon the definition used, PWG below current Institute of Medicine recommendations contributed to 10-15% of SGA, representing 0.8-1.2% of all singleton term infants.
No adhesions were found in primary CS. Compared with those women with a second CS (24.4%), significantly more women had adhesions after 3 CSs (42.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.99). Compared with a first CS (7.7 +/- 0.3 minutes), the delivery time was significantly longer at subsequent CSs (second CS, 9.4 +/- 0.1 minutes; 95% CI, 1-2; third CS, 10.6 +/- 0.3 minutes; 95% CI, 2-4; &gt;or= 4 CSs, 10.4 +/- 0.1 minutes; 95% CI, 1-2). However, complication rates in those women with &gt;or= 2 CSs were comparable with primary CS.
We were able to evaluate 19 pregnancies following unique abdominal cerclage placement, 12 laparoscopic and 7 at the time of laparotomy. Nine of 12 (75%) undergoing LC and 5 of 7 (71%) pregnancies undergoing AC successfully delivered a viable infant (P = .63). LC during pregnancy was successful in 4 of 5 (80%) cases as compared to 3 of 5 (60%) cases with AC during pregnancy (P = 1.0).
The NN, LR225, and LR600 correctly predicted 53%, 26%, and 32% of the patients with CD and 88%, 95%, and 95% of the patients with vaginal delivery, respectively.
Twenty pigs were operated on. The porcine model was determined to be a good model for laparoscopic lymphadenectomy (11), ureteroneocystostomy (7), repair of vascular injury (11), bowel anastamoses (21), distal pancreatectomy (5), nephrectomy (6), partial hepatectomy (5), diaphram stripping (5), and diaphragmatic resection (4). Two attendings and 1 fellow judged the porcine model to be fair (remaining 11 good) for ileocolonic urinary diversion, mainly due to significant differences in anatomy. Liver mobilization (5) and splenectomy (11) were determined to be fair or poor models by all participants due to the limited attachments in the pig.
Intermittent force produced less root resorption than continuous force (P &lt;0.05). Analysis by position showed that the buccal-cervical region had significantly more root resorption than the other positions (P &lt;0.001), corresponding to a region of compression generated by tipping.
The QUEST and FSSG scores were significantly higher in the Class III group. Occlusal contact area and maximal voluntary bite force were significantly smaller in the Class III group. There was no significant difference in the salivary flow rates between the groups.
The norms for the mean Fx forces ranged from 1.62 (SD, 0.41) to 5.35 N (SD, 0.63). The mean Fz forces were between 0.07 (SD, 0.13) and -2.47 N (SD, 0.34). The highest intrusive forces were measured during vestibular displacement of the measuring tooth. The forces delivered by the thick appliances were overall significantly higher (P &lt;0.0001) than those of the thin materials. The forces delivered by the Biolon appliances were generally significantly higher (P &lt;0.0001) than those for the Erkodur materials.
When comparing digitized models with conventional plaster dental study models, we found a slight (0.4 mm) but statistically significant difference in the space analysis measurements on the maxillary models; measurements on the mandibular models were not significantly different. No significant difference was found between the measurements of the 2 examiners.
The method errors were 0.19, 0.21, and 0.19 mm in the x-, y- and z-axes, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant intraoperator or interoperator differences. The mean measurement error was -0.01 mm (SD, 0.129 mm). Five measurement errors were found to be statistically significantly different; however, all measurement errors were below the known voxel size and clinically insignificant. No differences were found in the measurements from the 2 CBCT scan orientations of the skull.
Both the CBCT and the caliper measurements were highly reliable (r &gt;0.90). The CBCT measurements tended to slightly underestimate the anatomic truth. This was statistically significant only for compounded measurements.
The cumulative survival rates were 85% at 6 months and 57% at 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier log rank test indicated significant differences in 3 explanatory variables: surgical stage, level of placement, and tissue response. Cox proportional hazards regression indicated that the 2-stage surgical procedure had a higher risk than the 1 stage. Placement at the high level had a greater risk than placement at the medium level. Inflammatory hypertrophy tissue reaction showed a higher risk than normal or mild inflammation. The t test showed that age and latency period were not significant.
No group showed statistically significant sex- or side-specific differences for posterior vertical height measurements (P &gt; 0.05). Asymmetry indexes (condylar, ramal, and condylar-plus-ramal) were similar, and no statistically significant differences were found among the unilateral and bilateral posterior crossbite groups and the normal occlusion sample.
During the Herbst phase, the mandibular incisors were significantly intruded, protruded, and proclined in both bite-jumping groups. Larger tooth movements occurred in group L than in group S. During the MB phase, comparable relapsing incisor tooth movements were seen in the 2 bite-jumping groups. There was moderate correlation between bite-jumping and incisor position changes during the Herbst and the Herbst/MB treatment periods. No associations were found between the amount of bite jumping and the changes of sagittal and vertical jaw relationships, age, and treatment growth period.
Soft-tissue facial characteristics showed strong correlations with several skeletal structures of skeletal Class III subjects (r &gt; or = 0.7, P &lt; 0.001). Thus, soft-tissue A'N'B', A'N'Pog', and N'A'/A'Pog' were highly related to skeletal ANB, ANPog, and NA/APog. Vertically, soft- and hard-tissue lower anterior face heights were strongly correlated. A soft-tissue A'N'B' angle of 6 degrees is the critical value below which skeletal Class III can be implied (sensitivity, 90.5%; specificity, 81.0%). This finding was validated among female subjects.
The IGF-1 levels were highest at the hand-wrist skeletal stages that were previously associated with the greatest amount of mandibular growth. These levels were significantly higher than at prepubertal and postpubertal stages. In the postpubertal group, the IGF-1 levels were lower as the subjects' ages increased and they moved away from the onset of puberty.
Although differences between the treatment groups were found in both the maxillary and mandibular arches after phase 1, these differences were no longer evident by the end of full orthodontic treatment or after posttreatment retention.
In group II, the periodontal ligament (PDL) was compressed in the bifurcation and apical areas of the roots of the molar. On day 7, the PDL of the apical and distal aspects of the roots and the bifurcation area showed further compression, with the PDL of the roots stretched along the mesial side. In group III, a disorganized and compressed PDL in the mesial cervical half and interradicular septum was observed, and the stretched fibers were at the distal aspects of the roots after days 4 to 7.
The 10% formalin rinsed sample had statistically significantly higher bond strength (16.9 +/- 6.56 MPa), and storage in ethanol (rinsed, 9.04 +/- 5.61 MPa; not rinsed, 9.08 +/- 3.5 MPa) and dry (8.34 +/- 3.80 MPa) produced significantly lower bond strengths. No difference was found between the other modes of storage or rinsing. The adhesive remnant index values showed no statistically significant difference between any groups.
There were no significant differences between sides. The maxillary cusp was retracted 3.2 mm, with less movement during the first (1.1 mm) than during the second 4 weeks (2.1 mm). The maxillary apices did not move horizontally. There were no significant vertical movements in the cusps and apices of the maxillary canines. The mandibular cusp was retracted 3.8 mm-1.1 mm during the first and 2.7 mm during the second 4 weeks. The mandibular apices were protracted 1.1 mm. The cusps and apices were intruded 0.6 and 0.7 mm, respectively. The only difference between jaws was the greater protraction of the mandibular apices during the second 4 weeks and in overall movement.
Three-dimensional overlays of superimposed models and 3D color-coded displacement maps allowed visual and quantitative assessment of growth and treatment changes. The range of interobserver errors for each anatomic region was 0.4 mm for the zygomatic process of maxilla, chin, condyles, posterior border of the rami, and lower border of the mandible, and 0.5 mm for the anterior maxilla soft-tissue upper lip.
There was no evidence of cytotoxicity on human gingival fibroblasts and no stimulation of proliferation of the MCF-7 cell line at any concentration, indicating no estrogenicity of aligner eluents.
Overall bone depth decreased with increasing distance from the midsagittal plane and from the anterior to the posterior palatal regions. Cortical bone thickness decreased from anterior to posterior, but no differences were detectable within measurement levels.
In the first posttest, the Student t test showed no significant differences (P &gt;0.05). However, in the second posttest 15 days later, a decrease was observed in the scores of group A, with significant differences (P &lt;0.05). Students approved the LVO usability aspects--effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction (82.45% +/- 6.78%).
Patients had increases in several inflammatory markers that correlated with the severity of lung disease and nutritional depletion. Compared with control subjects, patients with CF had increased diaphragm thickness and inspiratory muscle strength and showed a trend toward a reduction in limb muscle strength and bulk. Multiple regression analyses identified FFM and airway resistance as independent predictors of diaphragm thickness, but systemic inflammation had no (or only a minor) predictive effect on FFM, inspiratory muscle strength, diaphragm thickness, and limb muscle strength and bulk.
Gene expression patterns in IPF-AEx and IPF samples were similar for the genes that distinguish IPF from control lungs. Five hundred and seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate &lt; 5%) between stable IPF and IPF-AEx. Functional analysis of these genes did not indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes. CCNA2 and alpha-defensin protein levels were also higher and localized to the epithelium of IPF-AEx, where widespread apoptosis was also detected. alpha-Defensin protein levels were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF-AEx.
Despite the absence of respiratory symptoms in 48 (84.2%) of infants, a substantial proportion had lung disease with bacterial infection detected in 12 (21.1%), including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3); neutrophilic inflammation (41. 4 x 10(3) cells/ml representing 18.7% of total cell count); proinflammatory cytokines, with 44 (77.2%) having detectable IL-8; and 17 (29.8%) having detectable free neutrophil elastase activity. Inflammation was increased in those with infection and respiratory symptoms; however, the majority of those infected were asymptomatic. Radiologic evidence of structural lung disease was common, with 46 (80.7%) having an abnormal CT; 11 (18.6%) had bronchial dilatation, 27 (45.0%) had bronchial wall thickening, and 40 (66.7%) had gas trapping. On multivariate analysis, free neutrophil elastase activity was associated with structural lung disease. Most children with structural lung disease had no clinically apparent lung disease.
Two levels of exposure were identified: (1) very low birth weight (birth weight &lt;1,500 g) and (2) moderately low birth weight (birth weight, 1,500-2,499 g). Normal birth weight individuals (2,500-4,000 g) were considered unexposed. Respiratory hospitalizations were defined using discharge diagnosis codes. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio for hospitalization comparing exposed and unexposed individuals. A total of 4,674 case patients and 18,445 control subjects were identified. The odds ratio for hospitalization for respiratory illness was 1.83 for very low birth weight (95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.62; P = 0.001) and 1.34 for moderately low birth weight (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.53; P &lt; 0.0005). This association remained after adjustment for birth year, sex, maternal age, race, residence, and marital status.
An increase in dry lung weight, due to increased insoluble protein, lipid and cellular infiltrate, without pulmonary edema was found. Despite this, both forced impedance and air pressure-volume mechanics were normal. However, there was increased tissue stiffness in the absence of surface tension (saline pressure-volume curve) with a concurrent increase in both surfactant content and alveolar type II cell numbers, suggesting a novel homeostatic phenomenon.
TGF-beta1-induced EMT in AEC monolayers derived from subjects with asthma and normal donors. EMT was characterized by changes in cell morphology, increased expression of mesenchymal markers EDA-fibronectin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen-1, and loss of epithelial markers E-cadherin and zonular occludin-1. Inhibition of TGF-beta1-induced signaling with Smad3-inhibiting siRNA or TGF-beta1-neutralizing antibodies prevented and reversed EMT, respectively, whereas BMP-7 had no effect. In ALI-AEC cultures derived from normal subjects, EMT was confined to basally situated cells, whereas in asthmatic ALI-AEC cultures EMT was widespread throughout the epithelium.
PMN isolated from the sputum of the bronchiectatic patients display defective phagocytosis that correlated with high concentrations of HNP in the lung. When healthy PMN were incubated with HNP, decreased phagocytic capacity was observed in association with depressed surface Fc gamma RIII, actin-filament remodeling, enhanced intracellular Ca(2+), and degranulation. Treatment of PMN with an intracellular Ca(2+) blocker or alpha1-proteinase inhibitor to attenuate the activity of HNP largely prevented the HNP-induced phagocytic deficiency. Intratracheal instillation of HNP in Pallid mice (genetically deficient in alpha1-proteinase inhibitor) resulted in a greater PMN lung infiltration and phagocytic deficiency compared with wild-type mice.
A total of 4,150 adults were included in our study. Among them, 12% reported a history of COPD (29% severe, 71% nonsevere disease). On repeated measurement, mean cognition scores of older adults with both severe and nonsevere COPD were significantly lower when compared with adults without COPD (2.6 points [P &lt; 0.001] and 0.9 points [P &lt; 0.001], respectively). After multivariable adjustment, mean scores of adults with severe COPD remained lower (0.9 point [P &lt; 0.001]), whereas mean score of adults with nonsevere COPD was no longer different (P = 0.39) when compared with adults without COPD.
Different patients harbored clonally unrelated strains, but early, intermediate, and late P. aeruginosa isolates from single patients were clonally related, allowing comparative in vivo analysis. Although late isolates were attenuated in causing acute mortality in the mouse models, compared with early and intermediate clonal isolates and environmental strains, they did not differ from early and intermediate clonal isolates in their capacity to establish chronic infection and cause extensive inflammation in the murine respiratory tract.
Current cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.11-2.50; p=0.014) and current betel quid chewing (OR, 1.97; 95%CI, 1.06-3.64; p=0.032), but not current alcohol drinking, were found to be independent risk factors for the development of calcium urolithiasis. The joint risk of current cigarette smoking and current betel quid chewing was increased 3.73-fold (OR, 3.73; 95%CI, 1.81-7.70, p&lt;0.001) compared to those who had neither habit.
Recurrent event models showed that male veterans who reported being less active than their peers were 1.42 (1.02-1.97) to 2.46 (1.18-5.14) times more likely to fall than those who reported being about as or more active than their peers (n = 270; mean age +/- SD = 81.1 +/- 4.0 years). None of the non-recurrent event models detected a statistically significant association between PA and falls.
Interviews of 52 mothers (19 declining vaccination, 33 accepting) identified several distinct factors underlying their decisions about HPV vaccination. Lack of knowledge about HPV, age-related concerns, and low perceived risk of infection were commonly cited reasons for declining vaccination. Desire to prevent illness, physician recommendation, and a high perceived risk of infection were commonly identified motivating factors. Both groups of mothers had significant concerns about vaccine safety. Locus of control (e.g., mother or daughter) of health-related decisions arose as a novel factor influencing this decision that had not been previously described in the context of HPV vaccination.
Compared to GSTM1 wild-type carriers, the relative odds of lung cancer increased from 1.49 (95% CI=0.66-3.40) to 1.80 (95% CI=0.81-4.02) for the hemizygous and homozygous deletion genotypes, respectively (p-trend=0.13). The strongest associations were seen among those who smoked less than one pack per day and had greater than or equal to one deletion variant of GSTM1 (OR=3.25; 95% CI=0.93-11.34; p-trend=0.07) whereas the reverse was observed for smokers who smoked greater than or equal to one pack per day (OR=0.80; 95% CI=0.24-2.67; p-interaction=0.08). No clear associations were observed for GSTT1 genotypes.
Both simple and covariate-adjusted models indicated that urinary cadmium was associated with elevated CRP and fibrinogen in a dose-dependent fashion (p(trend)&lt;0.05 for both). Adjusted odds ratios for increased CRP and fibrinogen comparing highest with lowest quartiles of urinary cadmium were 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-2.12) and 2.12 (1.43-3.14), respectively.
Among Texas male prisoners, HCV death rates were high and increased over the 10-year study period by an average 21% annually, with the largest increase occurring among Hispanic prisoners. HCV was identified as an intervening or contributing cause of death in 15% of chronic liver disease/cirrhosis deaths, 33% of liver cancer deaths, 81% of hepatitis B deaths, and 7% of HIV deaths.
Mean EE from DLW was 2115 kcal/day. Adjusted 24HR-derived energy intake was lowest at call 1 (1501 kcal/day); significantly higher energy intake was observed at calls 2 and 3 (2246 and 2315 kcal/day, respectively). Energy intake on Friday was significantly lower than on Sunday. Averaging energy intake from the first two calls better approximated true energy expenditure than did the first call, and averaging the first three calls further improved the estimate (p=0.02 for both comparisons). Additional calls did not improve estimation.
The odds ratio (OR) for river water intake's association with KBD was 5.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]), 3.32-10.72). Compared with relatives of controls, proband relatives had a higher risk of disease, with a conditional OR = 2.35 (95% CI, 1.05-5.24). When river water was controlled in the analyses, association parameters among first- and second-degree relatives were no longer statistically significant.
After we controlled for gender, age, marital status, educational attainment, and language of preference, differences were found by country of origin. Those coming from Peru (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.45; 95%CI=1.85-6.43) and Colombia (AOR=1.94; 95%CI=1.12-3.36) were more likely than U.S.-native Hispanics to perceive their risk of acquiring HIV as above average. Sexually active Mexicans (AOR=1.80; 95%CI=1.04-3.10) were significantly more likely than U.S. natives to have used a condom in the past 12 months. Young adults coming from Puerto Rico (AOR=0.55; 95%CI=0.33-0.91) were less likely than U.S.-native Hispanics to have ever been tested for HIV. Virginity and sexual abstinence were unrelated to country of origin, but respondents interviewed in Spanish were more likely than those interviewed in English to be sexually active (AOR=2.57; 95%=1.39-4.75).
Strict factorial invariance across the four race/ethnicity groups was demonstrated based on stability of the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) between the models, and several additional indices of practical fit including the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), the Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), and the Parsimony Normed Fit Index (PNFI).
Residents in communities high in luvisols were approximately 2.7 times more likely to have cKS than those in communities with no luvisols. Risk was not specific for cKS on the limbs, but it was elevated approximately four- to five-fold with frequent bathing or tap water drinking in communities with high luvisols. Risk was unrelated to communities high in andosols, tephra, or clay soils.
The incubation modifies both chrysotile and balangeroite with substantial release in the medium of the metal ions which occupy the octahedral site in the mineral structure of the fibre while tremolite is virtually unaffected.
Only 2.5% of the 80 personal inhalation exposures to MbOCA exceeded the workplace exposure limit of 5 microg m(-3) 8-h time-weighted average and 84% were below the limit of detection (LOD). Surface samples (n = 334) were collected from MbOCA users and suppliers and 60% had detectable levels of MbOCA ranging from 0.019 to 400 microg cm(-2). The highest levels were around a hopper, ovens, and the weighing and pouring areas. MbOCA was also detected in 8 of the 75 samples collected from areas not likely to be in contact with MbOCA. At the two suppliers, samples (n = 28) were collected from the outside surfaces of recently imported kegs, pallets, and the floor around kegs. Six samples had detectable levels and four of these (0.2, 0.8, 1, and 6 microg cm(-2)) were from the floor and pallets in both suppliers. The other two positive results were found on the outside rim (18 microg cm(-2)) and side (23 microg cm(-2)) of a keg at one supplier indicating contamination by the manufacturer. Urine samples (n = 79) were collected and 49% were below the LOD for MbOCA and only three samples had levels of MbOCA that exceeded the biological monitoring guidance value (BMGV) of 15 micromol mol(-1) creatinine. The highest urinary MbOCA concentrations were in samples from workers casting and moulding. The 90th percentile of the urine MbOCA results was 8.6 micromol MbOCA per mol creatinine. Urine samples were also analysed for the diamine metabolites of toluene diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate and 33% had detectable levels with 22 and 13% of results, respectively, above the BMGV for isocyanates (1 micromol isocyanate-derived diamine per mol creatinine). The maximum urinary concentration of toluene diamine and hexane diamine were 15.6 and 10.1 micromol mol(-1) creatinine, respectively.
Given a specified alternative hypothesis, the desired significance level and statistical power, the number of repeated measurements, within-worker and between-worker variances, and a correlation structure, we have derived and tabulated an explicit sample size requirement of the two hypothetical cases under log-normal distribution assumption.
SVR, RVR and EVR were observed in 46%, 23% and 78% of patients, respectively. PPVs of RVR were 96%, 100% and 100% in treatment-naive patients, relapsers and non-responders, respectively. NPVs of failure to achieve EVR were 97%, 75% and 91%, in treatment-naive patients, relapsers and non-responders, respectively. At 4 weeks, patients with RVR had the highest probability to achieve SVR (odds ratio 44.98 in the entire population and 32.95 in treatment-naive patients). ROC curves showed the area under the ROC curve to be 0.758 versus 0.832 in the entire population and 0.795 versus 0.858 in treatment-naive patients at baseline versus week 4, respectively.
A total of 17 patients were classed as RVR. In the RVR group, the mean +/-sd serum alanine aminotransferase levels significantly decreased (before treatment 103 +/-92 IU/l and after treatment 57 +/-46 IU/l; P&lt;0.05) during ribavirin monotherapy. The mean +/-sd Th1/Th2 ratio significantly increased (before treatment 13.9 +/-5.1 and after treatment 16.7 +/-6.2; P&lt;0.05), but did not change in the non-RVR group. The levels of Th2 cytokines (interleukin-10 and soluble CD30) significantly decreased, especially in the RVR group. The mean +/-sd mutation rates of ISDR at the nucleotide level increased in the RVR group (before treatment 2.6 +/-0.9 sites/clone and after treatment 3.9 +/-1.6 sites/clone; P&lt;0.05), but did not change in the non-RVR group.
In total, 230 patients (120 treatment-naive and 110 with virological failure) were included: 98% had clade C virus. Among treatment-naive patients, prevalence of primary resistance was 2.5% (95% confidence interval 0.0-5.3). Three patients had one significant reverse transcriptase mutation: K65R, Y181C and G190A. Among treatment-experienced patients, 95 (86%) individuals had therapy-limiting NNRTI mutations, including K103N (55%), V106M (31%) and Y181C (9%). The M184V mutation was the most common mutation, found in 86 (78%) patients. In total, 10 (9%) patients had the K65R mutation. More individuals tended to develop thymidine analogue mutations when sampling occurred after 6 months of detected therapy failure (10/31 [32%] individuals) compared with those who had genotyping before 6 months (15/79 [19%] patients; P=0.246).
Prosultiamine, like allicin, induced caspase-dependent apoptosis against HCT-1 cells. The fact that the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was recovered in z-VAD-fmk-pretreated HCT-1 cells with prosultiamine treatment suggested that prosultiamine can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. On the basis of data showing that prosultiamine in vitro treatment against peripheral blood CD4(+) T-cells of HAM/TSP patients induced a significant decrease of HTLV-I proviral copy numbers by apoptosis of HTLV-I-infected cells, we treated six HAM/TSP patients with intravenous administration of prosultiamine for 14 days. As a result of this treatment, the copy numbers of HTLV-I provirus in peripheral blood decreased to approximately 30-50% of their pretreatment levels with some clinical benefits in all patients.
Of the 2,857 participants (most of whom were receiving antiretroviral therapy) analysed, 16% and 3% had P/Cr levels &gt;/=0.2 and &gt;/=1.0, respectively, at first measurement. P/Cr levels did not change during a median follow-up of 3 years (interquartile range 2-4). Factors associated with P/Cr&gt;/=0.2 at any measurement included greater age, lower glomerular filtration rate, female sex, antiretroviral therapy prior to entry into parent randomized trial, HIV type-1 RNA level &gt;/=400 copies/ml, lower CD4(+) T-cell count and history of hypertension, diabetes or hepatitis C coinfection (all P&lt;0.04). Black race and higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were associated with P/Cr levels &gt;/=1.0, but not with P/Cr levels &gt;/=0.2. Hepatitis B coinfection and current use of adefovir, indinavir and tenofovir were not associated with either of the P/Cr thresholds.
Genotypic resistance was detected in 37/263 (14.1%) patients. Patients were infected by HIV-1 clade B in 222 (84%) cases and with non-B subtypes in 41 (16%). A total of 80 (30.4%) RT sequences were segregated in 24 clusters with bootstrap values &gt;98% for 22 clusters. The frequency of grouping in clusters was higher within B sequences compared with non-B sequences (35.1% versus 4.9%; P&lt;2.10(-4)). Drug-resistant isolates were retrieved in only 3 clusters, but the prevalence of resistance in clustering viruses (10/80, 12.5%) was not different than in isolated sequences.
In total, 14 (23%) patients showed virological breakthrough (10/30 on ADV monotherapy and 4/30 on ADV+3TC). ADV resistance mutations (rtA181V/T and rtN236T) were detected alone or in combination for 11/14 patients, whereas novel substitutions were present in 3 patients. Before ADV treatment, apart from 3TC resistance signature mutations, additional changes were found, including the rtA181T mutation, which was already present in 2/14 ADV-resistant patients.
The incidence of LTFU was estimated to be 3.5 per 100 person-years. Risk factors for LTFU at enrolment in a multivariate Cox model were age &lt;30 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.66 versus &gt;40 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.64), transmission by injection drug use (HR 5.26 versus men who have sex with men, 95% CI 2.90-9.52), no phone number provided (HR 5.4, 95% CI 3.6-8.2), no primary care physician (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.25-3.52) and sub-Saharan African origin (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.36-3.22). Patients with CD4(+) T-cell counts &lt;200 cells/mm(3) (HR 0.49 versus &gt;/=350 cells/mm(3), 95% CI 0.32-0.76) and 200-349 cells/mm(3) at baseline (HR 0.63 versus &gt;/=350 cells/mm(3), 95% CI 0.41-0.98) had a decreased risk of LTFU. During follow-up, the risk of LTFU increased when the most recent CD4(+) T-cell count was &lt;200 cells/mm(3) (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.16-3.66), the patient was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; HR 4.20, 95% CI 2.66-6.61) and the patient was on HAART but had a detectable viral load (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19-3.01).
The sustained virological response (SVR) rates were 31% in HCV-1 and HCV-4, 80% in HCV-2 and 72% in HCV-3, and were lower in cirrhotic than in non-cirrhotic HCV-1 and HCV-4 (17% versus 36%; P=0.01), and HCV-3 (33% versus 79%; P=0.001), but not HCV-2 (69% versus 83%; P=0.1) patients. Treatment failure was the consequence of lower end-of-treatment response rates (37% versus 53%; P=0.06) plus higher post-treatment relapse rates (55% versus 31%; P=0.07) in cirrhotic HCV-1 and HCV-4 patients and higher rates of post-treatment relapse in HCV-2 (29% versus 10%; P=0.01) and HCV-3 cirrhotic patients (61% versus 12%; P&lt;0.001). By multivariate analysis, HCV-1 and HCV-4 (odds ratio [OR] 7.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.87-11.36), and cirrhosis (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.80-5.00) were independent predictors of treatment failure.
At baseline, the mean age of patients was 42 years, 32 were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 15 had liver cirrhosis. After 12 months of clevudine therapy, the mean serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level in HBeAg-positive patients had decreased by 4.6 log(10) IU/ml. Serum HBV DNA was undetectable in 68.7% of patients. HBeAg loss or seroconversion was observed in five patients (15.6%) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level had normalized after 12 months of treatment in 75% of patients. In all 13 HBeAg-negative patients, serum HBV DNA level was undetectable after 12 months of therapy and ALT level was normal in 61.5% of patients. Viral breakthrough occurred in one patient after 9 months of clevudine treatment. This patient had an HBV polymerase mutation, rtM204I. There were no serious adverse events.
Patients dosed with either TVR monotherapy or TVR plus PEG-IFN-alpha2a had median first and second phase decreases of 12 per day and 1.1 per day, respectively. The second phase decrease was approximately 10-fold higher than reported values for IFN-based treatments (P&lt;0.0001). Patients dosed with TVR plus PEG-IFN-alpha2a had a median remaining viral production after blockage (1-epsilon) of -2.37 log(10). In patients dosed with TVR monotherapy, increased TVR dosage of the same schedule was related to better blockage.
The ENF resistance levels produced by the introduction of mutation V38A in pretherapeutic env sequences were significantly lower than those of env clones harvested after viral escape, and in which V38A was naturally selected. Back-mutation of V38A from these clones resulted in a strong loss in ENF resistance, but these clones retained significant residual resistance, again strongly suggesting the role of determinants outside of HR1 in HIV-1 resistance to ENF. By contrast with changes in resistance, addition or removal of HR1 mutations in env clones had little effect on viral replicative capacity.
Seven patients (five girls and two boys) were included in the study. Median age was 9.8 years (range 5.8-15.5). For the once-daily treatment, the median (range) lopinavir 24 h area under the plasma -concentration-time curve (AUC(24 h)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and 24 h plasma concentration (C(24 h)) were 214.6 h*mg/l (114.2-289.2), 13.5 mg/l (8.3-17.5) and 3.4 mg/l (0.6-7.4), respectively. For the twice-daily treatment the median (range) lopinavir 12 h area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(12 h)), C(max) and 12 h plasma concentration (C(12 h)) were 80.9 h*mg/l (23.3-135.9), 9.8 mg/l (3.4-15.2) and 5.7 mg/l (1.7-9.7), respectively.
A total of 419 patients were analyzed, of whom 138 (32.9%) presented REM-specific SDB. This condition was more common in patients with mild to moderate SAHS than in those with more severe cases (odds ratio, 8.21; 95% confidence interval, 4.83-14.03). The variables independently associated with REM-specific SDB in the logistic regression analysis were female sex, lower AHI, and higher body mass index. No interactions between the main variables studied were found. There were no differences between patients with REM-specific SDB and those with non-REM-specific SDB with regard to signs and symptoms related to SAHS, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep architecture, cardiovascular risk factors, or history of cardiovascular episodes.
After exploratory EVT, 44 pT3 tumors with chest wall invasion were confirmed intraoperatively and by histopathology. Of these, 36 had been correctly classified as cT3 by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, tumors had been understaged as cT2 in 6 patients and overstaged as cT4 in 2 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values obtained were 100%.
A total of 92 patients were included. Survival was 89.3%, 70%, and 54% at 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years after transplantation, respectively. Dehiscence of the surgical suture (P&lt;.001), duration of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (P=.04), duration of the surgical procedure (P&lt;.001), and single-lung transplantation (P=.007) were the variables associated with mortality. Extracorporeal circulation and the need for hemodiafiltration in the intensive care unit increased the short-term risk of death (P&lt;.05). The age of the recipient was the variable associated with long-term mortality (P=.02). The duration of the surgical intervention was associated with an increase in short-, medium-, and long-term mortality.
The mean (SD) lung function results were FVC, 72 (16%); FEV(1), 43% (14%); FEV(1)/FVC, 42% (9%); residual volume, 161% (44%); total lung capacity, 112% (17%); DLCO, 58% (17%); and KCO, 75% (25%). Mean (SD) tidal volumes measured by the pneumotachometer and the EIT unit were 0.697 (0.181)L and 0.515 (0.223)L, respectively (P&lt;.001). Significant associations were found between EIT measurements and CO transfer parameters. The mathematical model developed to adjust for the differences between the 2 measurements (R(2)=0.568; P&lt;.001) was compensation factor=1.81# - 0.82# height (m)# -0.004 x KCO (%).
Activation timing patterns (P&lt;.01; eta=.50; 1-beta=.99) and number of muscles functioning in feedforward (P=.02; eta=.30; 1-beta=.83) were statistically different between patients with MLBP and controls. The control group activated the external oblique, lumbar multifidus, and erector spinae muscles in a feedforward manner. The heterogeneous MLBP group did not activate the trunk musculature in feedforward, but responded with significantly delayed activations. MLBP subgroups demonstrated significantly different timing patterns. The noninstability MLBP subgroup activated trunk extensors in a feedforward manner, similar to the control group, but significantly earlier than the instability subgroup.
Velocity decreased as surface rolling resistance or chair weight increased. Peak resultant and tangential forces increased as chair weight increased, as surface resistance increased, and with a posterior axle position. The effect of a posterior axle position was greater on high carpet and the ramp. The effect of weight was constant, but was more easily observed on high carpet and ramp. The effects of axle position and weight were independent of one another.
Logistic regression procedures were used to determine group association with symptoms and psychiatric diagnosis after controlling for demographic variables, combat intensity, medical disorders, and other current psychiatric conditions. MTBI was associated with headaches, memory problems, sleep problems, and fainting even after controlling for current psychiatric problems (including PTSD), as well as demographic variables, combat intensity, and comorbid medical conditions. MTBI also was associated with a current diagnosis of PTSD even controlling for other demographic, psychiatric, and medical covariates. MTBI did not moderate or mediate the relationship between PTSD and current symptomatology. However, MTBI did adversely affect long-term recovery from PTSD (odds ratio=1.59, 95% CI, 1.07-2.37). PTSD also was associated with physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, and had a larger effect size than MTBI.
There was no significant change with periodic use of salbutamol in the total composite QMT z-score, MMT score, or timed motor tests. Salbutamol was well tolerated. Lack of efficacy did not seem to be related to plasma concentrations, which were within the expected range.
Subjects (N=225) were randomized with a dropout rate of 13.8%. There was a trend toward reductions in DPN symptoms on the PGIC, favoring the PEMF group (44% vs 31%; P=.04). There were no significant differences between PEMF and sham groups in the NP intensity on NPS or VAS. Twenty-seven subjects completed serial biopsies. Twenty-nine percent of PEMF subjects had an increase in distal leg ENFD of at least 0.5 SDs, while none did in the sham group (P=.04). Increases in distal thigh ENFD were significantly correlated with decreases in pain scores.
Mean +/- standard deviation age of the sample was 70.4+/-13.4 years, and 31% had diabetes (6% tier, 25% nontier). Diabetes status by age demonstrated significant (P&lt;.05) interaction effects, which lead to the following age-specific findings. In younger stroke patients (60y), tier diabetes was associated with shorter lengths of stay compared with both groups, lower FIM discharge scores compared with both groups, and lower odds of discharge home relative to the no-diabetes group. In older stroke patients (80y), tier diabetes was associated with longer lengths of stay compared with both groups and with higher FIM discharge scores compared with the nontier group.
The prevalence of malingering in patients with chronic pain with financial incentive is between 20% and 50% depending on the diagnostic system used and the statistical model's underlying assumptions. Some factors associated with the medico-legal context such as the jurisdiction of a workers' compensation claim or attorney representation were associated with slightly higher malingering rates.
Mean age +/- SD of participants was 48.7+/-15.6 years. Vitamin D deficiency, 25-OHD level 50 nmol/L or less, occurred in 154 (62.9%); insufficiency, a level between 51 and 72 nmol/L, occurred in 36 (14.7%). Based on T scores, 108 participants (42.4%) had osteopenia, and 60 (23.5%) had osteoporosis. A z score of -1 or less but more than -2 occurred in 76 (29.8%); a further 52 (20.4%) had a z score of -2 or less. On multiple linear regression analysis, ambulatory status and duration of disability were independent predictors of BMD at neck of femur (beta=.152, P=.007; beta=-.191, P=.001, respectively) and total proximal femur (beta=.170, P=.001; beta=-.216, P&lt;.001, respectively).
There were significant group x side interactions for anterior displacement, inversion rotation, eversion rotation, ankle isometric strength, and the foot and ankle disability index (P&lt;.05). The affected ankle of the OA group demonstrated significantly more mechanical stiffness, more impairments in ankle/foot isometric strength, and less subjective level of function than the matched controls. Additionally, the ankle OA group exhibited significantly more center of pressure displacement, total velocity, and medial-lateral velocity (P&lt;.05).
A significant interaction was found between group, time, and side for anterior translation (F=4.24, P=.05). There were also significant main effects for group. There was significantly more anterior displacement at day 3 (F=19.52, P=.001) and at week 8 (F=8.45, P=.010) in the injured group compared with the healthy group. There was also significantly more inversion rotation at day 3 (F=2.70, P=.002) and at week 8 (F=5.4, P=.033) in the injured group compared with the healthy group.
There were 41,804 visits for musculoskeletal complaints, representing 789 million visits from 1999 to 2005 in the weighted analyses. Prescribing for any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remained relatively stable from 1999 to 2005. It appears that COX-2 inhibitors were substituted for nsNSAIDs initially. After safety concerns arose and select COX-2 inhibitors were withdrawn, there were sharp increases in prescribing of nsNSAIDs and nonnarcotic analgesics. Opiate analgesics and adjuvant analgesics increased in usage over the study period, although apparently not in substitution for NSAIDs.
We observed a significant increase in the electromyographic activity of the trapezius (P&lt;.05) with the use of orthoses. No significant difference was observed in the activities of the flexor digitorum superficialis or extensor carpi ulnaris in participants who typed with or without orthoses (P&gt;.05). However, when the participants used the mouse, the extensor muscle presented an increase in activity with both orthoses, and the same pattern was observed in the flexor muscle when the volunteers used the custom-made orthosis.
Although the younger subjects showed a significantly greater control of balance than the older women in most tests, control of balance after acute fatigue failed to show a significant decline in either age group. The only exception to this was the SLSTT in the younger women in whom a significant 26% decline was noted (P&lt;.05).
The nonlinear tool of approximate entropy presented high intrasession and intersession ICC values compared with all other parameters evaluated. Generally, intrasession and intersession reliability increased in the last 2 months of the data collection and as sitting posture matured.
Significant changes with large effect sizes in head/trunk stability and reaching/targeting, elapsed time, and efficiency (reach/path ratio) after 12 weeks of hippotherapy intervention. Changes were retained after a 12-week washout period.
Recurrent examples of IPC fit 2 dominant themes: team culture (divided into leadership, care philosophy, relationships, and the context of practice) and communication structures (both formal and informal).
The median LOS was 29 days (mean = 30.8d). Independent clinical and sociodemographic characteristics found to significantly predict rehabilitation LOS were FIM motor score at admission, the presence of more than 3 comorbid conditions at admission, living with nonimmediate relatives before admission, and the hospital subsidy status of the patient. In particular, the admission FIM motor score explained 43% of the variation in LOS and decreased the LOS by approximately 1.1 days for each 1-point increase in score.
The first principal component accounted for nearly half of the overall variability in the BBS, correlated well with rates of change in functional mobility measures, and had good stability in its composition as verified by a resampling analysis. Further analysis showed that the composition of the first principal component varied with the patient's level of recovery.
(1) Depression was significantly less post-SCI compared with noninjured subjects at all interstimulus intervals and (2) post-SCI at 100-millisecond interstimulus interval: reflex depression significantly increased postbicycle training in all SCI subjects and in the chronic and spastic subgroups (P&lt;.05).
A total of 252 interventions were assigned. The agreement between the researcher and the participants was good: the percentage of correct interventions was high at both measurements (91.7% and 94.4%). Intrarater agreement was also good (90.9%). The interrater agreement within the physical therapists and the occupational therapists was high at both occasions (mean, 92.3% and 87.0%, respectively), but lower within the sports therapists (mean, 69.3%).
MVC declined with older age (P&lt;.0001). Adjusting for differences in MVC, both firing rate and motor unit size per newton force generated began to increase in the 6th decade of life. Motor unit size increased per newton force to a greater extent than firing rate. Those over the age of 75 years also activated significantly larger motor units per unit force (P=.04). Relative to force generated, the average firing rate began increasing at 57.8+/-3.4 years and between 50.2 and 56.4 years (+/-4y) for motor unit size.
Twenty-nine participants (26%) had RBBB (6 with incomplete RBBB). Evidence that PE caused RBBB was found in 21 (72%), with 4 (3 massive) found by autopsy, 4 by the presence of an embolic source, 3 by imaging, 2 by the intermittent course of RBBB, 1 by abrupt onset of RBBB before death, and 7 by other ECG signs. RBBB represented chronic obstructive lung disease or myocardial infarction in the remaining 8. The onset of RBBB occurred either within months of SCI in 5 (1 before SCI) or years after SCI in 24 (6-50y, median 32y). RBBB was constant in 27 and intermittent in 2. The duration of RBBB ranged from 20 minutes to 31 years, median 4 years.
Less than 1.0 mSv doses were found in 26 co-habitants and 2.8 mSv in a single case (inferior to the acceptable value of 5.0 mSv/procedure). Potential doses in the houses were inferior to 0.25 mSv, excluding the patients bedroom (mean value = 0.69 mSv). Surface contamination (mean = 4.2 Bq.cm-2) were below clearance levels. Radioactive wastes generated had a volume of 2.5 liters and a total activity estimated in 90 microCi, with a calculated exposure close to the background radiation levels.
GIPR and LHCGR expressions were demonstrated in all tissues studied. Median GIPR and LHCGR mRNA levels were 1.6; 0.4; 0.5 and 1.3; 0.9; 1.0 in adrenocortical tissues from AIMAH, PPNAD and DAHCD respectively. There were no differences between GIPR and LHCGR expressions in all tissues studied.
When compared to NT-NO (n = 17) group, HT-NO (n = 18) showed higher blood pressure levels (systolic and diastolic), greater VF area (84.40 +/- 55.70 versus 37.50 +/- 23.00 cm(2); p = 0.036), greater SCF area (174.30 +/- 83.00 versus 79.80 +/- 27.40 cm(2); p = 0.030), higher HOMAr index (1.59 +/- 0.72 versus 0.93 +/- 0.48 mmol*mU/L(2); p = 0.006), higher CDI index (12.67 +/- 7.04 versus 6.19 +/- 2.57 cm(2)/kg) and higher leptin level (19.1 +/- 9.6 versus 7.4 +/- 3.5 ng/mL; p = 0.028).
It was observed a prevalence of 20.8% of gingivitis and 5.9% of periodontitis. Those individuals with poor metabolic control had higher percentage of affected sites on PD (p = 0.004) and on CAL (p = 0.014). Patients having more than five years with diabetes mellitus type 1 showed higher percentual of affected sites on PD (p = 0.002), on BOP (p &lt; 0.001) and on CAL (p = 0.007).
Considering all the patients, only 48 (57.1%) presented classification of BMI that agreed with the SF method, 58 (69%) with the BI and 45 (53.5%) with the TT. The K results for individuals with T1D was DC = 0.261, BI = 0.320 and TT = 0.174. The controls had higher values (DC = 0.605, BI = 0.360 and TT = 0.400). However, all values were considered low.
The DQB1 *0302 and DQA1 *03 alleles were identified as predisposed to T1ADM, and the DQB1 *0301 allele presented a protective effect against the disease.The DQA1 label proved to be able to differentiate between 71.13% of the diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.This value increased to 82.47% when the DQB1 label was added. No significant difference in the frequency of polymorphisms in the insulin and CTLA-4 genes was observed between the two groups.
In two patients (2/21), conventional colonoscopy was incomplete. However, in all patients computed tomographic colonography was complete. In Phase I ('per patient'), computed tomographic colonography diagnosed eight of the nine patients with colorectal polyps and showed 88% sensitivity, 75% specificity and 81% accuracy. In Phase II ('per polyp'), out of the 21 acromegalic patients included in this study, 12 presented normal findings at conventional colonoscopy. A total of 19 polyps were identified in 9 patients. Ten of the 19 polyps were smaller than 10 mm, and 9 were equal to or larger than 10 mm. Computed tomographic colonography identified 7 of the 9 polyps &gt;10 mm described by conventional colonoscopy and only 6 of the 10 small polyps identified at conventional colonoscopy were detected by computed tomographic colonography. The histological analysis of resected lesions revealed 12 tubular adenomas, 6 hyperplastic polyps and 1 colonic tubulo-villous adenoma with an adenocarcinoma focus.
There were 30 men and 64 women in each group (94 cases and 94 controls). The mean age of the cases was 59.79 +/- 12.25 years and that of the controls was 58.98 +/- 11.55 years. The H. pylori serology was positive for 66 (70.21%) of the cases and for 51 (54.25%) of the controls. There was a significant difference (P = 0.024). The odds ratio was 1.98 (CI 95%, 0.82-3.15). The prevalence of H. pylori in cases and controls according to gender, histological type and location of the colon lesions showed a significant difference only among women (P = 0.03), among patients with tubular adenomas (P = 0.03), and in those with distal adenomas (P = 0.038).
The correlation between patients with normal ileoscopy and ileum with preserved histological architecture was of 99.1%. The agreement between initial histological evaluation and slides review calculated by the Kappa test was 0.21. In patients with abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhea, the chance of showing histological alterations was 2.5 times higher than the others.
Different morphometric measures were performed via image analysis software to measure the mean pit opening diameters and their respective area. The mean pit opening diameters and corresponding area measurements were statistically significant for all groups of lesions examined.
One hundred and sixteen of the 157 lesions were classified as positive meshed capillary network, 115 of them were confirmed histologically as neoplasia. Other 32 lesions out of 41 with negative meshed capillary network were non-neoplastic. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were, respectively, 92.7%, 97% and 93.6%. Pit patterns I and II were confirmed as non-neoplastic lesions, and patterns III to V were confirmed as neoplasias. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the electronic chromoendoscopy were, respectively, 94.4%, 97% and 94.9%. Meanwhile, the figures for the magnification with indigo carmine were, respectively, 97.6%, 93.9% and 96.8%.
Among the 40 patients, 21 were men, the mean age was 56 years, 16 occurred in the small intestine and 13 in the stomach, 5 in the retroperitonium, 4 in the colon or rectum and 2 in the mesenterium. Thirty two tumors were from group I and 8 from group II. Half of the patients developed recurrence, being 90% of the group I (P = 0.114). The tumor Ki67 labelling index ranged from 0.02 to 0.35 (mean level 0.12). This index was marginally higher in the group I patients with recurrence (P = 0.09) compared to the patients of the same group without recurrence. p53 staining was expressed in 65% of the GISTs. A higher frequency of p53 and Ki67 had been found in the group I tumors when compared to the other group (P = 0.022; OR = 8.00 - IC 95%: 1.32-48.65).
Four of the six patients were female and two male. Ages ranged from 42 to 62 years. Hernia duration varied from 5 to 40 years. Four patients had incisional, one umbilical, and one inguinal hernias. Mean pneumoperitoneum time was 11.6 days. There were no complications related to pneumoperitoneum installation and maintenance. All hernias were corrected without technical difficulties. The Lichtenstein technique was used to correct the inguinal hernia, peritoneal aponeurotic transposition for one of the incisional hernias, with the rest corrected using polypropylene mesh. One death and one wall infection were observed post operatively. No recurrences were reported until now, in 4 to 36 months of follow-up.
Goblet cells were present in 75 cases and columnar blue cells in 50 cases. Overall, cytokeratin 7 expression was similar in goblet cells and columnar blue cells (P = 0.25), while cytokeratin 20 was more common in goblet cells (P &lt;0.001). In individuals with both cell types, however, cytokeratin 7 staining was the same in goblet and columnar blue cells in 95% of the cases, and cytokeratin 20 staining was the same in 77%.
Eighty one patients were evaluated, 22 treated with IFN+RBV and 59 treated with PEG+RBV. Both were similar relating to age, gender, weight, CD4 cell count and fibrosis grade. Those treated with IFN+RBV presented a greater proportion of A2+A3 patients than those treated with PEG+RBV (P&lt;0.01). The sustained virological response was 14% versus 23% in those using IFN+RBV or PEG+RBV respectively (P = 0.54). The Odds Ratio was 1.9 (0.5 to 7.3).
Patent wrap was identified in 41 patients (91.1%). Recurrent peptic esophagitis was found in 6 of 45 patients, 2 of which required a second fundoplication and other two had Barrett esophagus. Endoscopic peptic esophagitis was associated with a defective wrap (P = 0.005). Conclusions - Fundoplication was effective for treating esophagitis, even in patients with previous esophageal stenosis. Endoscopic follow up may detect surgery failure in children undergone anti-reflux surgery even in asymptomatic patients.
Constipation occurred in 17.5%, 10.5%, 19.3% of the children by recall, the predominant and the adult criteria, respectively. Constipation was the main recalled alteration, vs 12.3% 'other bowel habit'. Only one child classified as having functional diarrhea (by the adult criterion). Agreement between recalled and recorded bowel habit was fair for constipation, by the predominant and the adult criteria (K = 0.28 and 0.24, respectively), but only slight (K &lt;0.16) for other bowel habit categories. Individual data, however, pointed to a better relationship between recalled constipation and the adult rather than the predominant criterion.
Although no formal guidelines have been established there are some 'golden rules' to improve the probability of favorable maternal and fetal outcome. Most transplant centers recommend to delay pregnancy for at least 1-year after transplantation. The recipient should be on a stable immunosuppression regimen, with good graft function and no evidence of renal dysfunction or uncontrolled arterial hypertension. Considering the increased incidence of prematurity, low birth weight, hypertension and preeclampsia reported during pregnancy post-LT, these high-risk patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including an obstetrician specialized in high-risk pregnancies. Carefully monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs serum level is prudent to avoid graft rejection episodes and drugs with teratogenic potential should be discontinued. Breastfeeding is usually not recommended.
Findings support the proposition that the patterns of human responses to disasters, particularly in protracted traumas such as war-zones, shows strong parallels to the contemporary patterns of experience and responses articulated by Aboriginal people affected by colonization and its sequelae in Australia.
All of those involved in 1983 are still alive. Over a range of social and economic indicators many score very well but there are signs, as with other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, of underlying health issues.
Despite high incarceration rates for Indigenous people and evidence that both mental health problems and rates of mental illness are extremely high in this group, studies in this area are few and limited in scope.
From the recruited sample (n=49), 18% reported heavy or frequent use of alcohol, cannabis or petrol. Males were more likely to have used these substances compared to females. Attrition increased as the follow-up interval increased with 49 recruits reducing to 32 in the first 2 months and only 15 and 13 of the initial group remaining for the 6 and 12 month follow-ups respectively.
The approach being pursued is consonant with the principles of contemporary guidelines; the results of the first phase qualitative study inquiring into workers' perceptions of violence revealed some differences in the understanding of violence between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal workers, with some ethical implications.
The following key needs were identified in a pilot study and are now being addressed in a research-based implementation phase: (i) gaining two-way understanding of perspectives on mental health and promoting universal awareness; (ii) supporting the empowerment of carers, families, consumers and at-risk groups through existing community organizations to gain greater understanding and control of their situation; (iii) developing pathways of care at the primary health centre level to enable support of social and emotional wellbeing as well as more integrated mental health care; (iv) accessing data to enable an ongoing process of analysis/sharing/planning and monitoring to inform future activity.
Key opportunities and challenges related to building staff capacity, engaging young people, giving voice to young people and reconciling diverse community views. Emerging outcomes included young people's definition of vision and values, social cohesion, personal achievements and recognition. The youth projects also resulted in local employment, improvements in workforce capacity and proposals to extend the empowerment model in Yarrabah and transfer it to another community.
Through the examination of this and other models health professionals can find answers to questions around how to gather evidence of how interventions work (or do not work), for whom and in what circumstances. Using evidence of this kind to inform planning processes and decision making will facilitate improved, sustained health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the future.
The Mental Health Review Tribunal is an independent statutory body established under the Mental Health Act 2000 (MHA2000) to safeguard the rights of patients receiving involuntary treatment under the Queensland MHA2000. In the period from when the Tribunal commenced in 2002 to end of June 2008, people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background represent 2.3% of all patient registrations with the Tribunal. The Tribunal has established a range of strategies to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients to attend and participate in their hearing. This includes widening the Tribunal's body of knowledge, strategies to inform patients about the Tribunal, culturally sensitive hearing practices, and widening the circle of participation in the hearing.
The project was requested by the local community; planning involved extensive consultation between Queensland Health, community leaders and local service providers; and it was delivered with extensive contributions from other Queensland Health services, various non-government organizations, Indigenous opinion-leaders and public media, and an NRL football team. The outcomes are sustainable at a local level.
A number of aspects of tikanga were identified as essential to the positive outcomes of the future plan. This paper reports one in particular, that of whakatauakī (proverbs where the originator is known). "Whakaora nga moemoea o nga tupuna--living the dreams of the ancestors" is a whakatauakī articulated by Whaea Moe Milne, which was identified as helpful in influencing the strategic planning thinking and decision-making process for He Kakano. This whakatauakī enabled the identification of shared goals, values, beliefs, behaviours and an action plan. The existing and ongoing relationship with Whaea Moe Milne was identified as an important element in the way in which the whakatauakī was received and reflected on.
A cyclic process of action research established that organizational policies, clinical skills and educational levels of staff were inadequate. Two overarching themes drove the research cycles: staff safety and inadequate education of nursing staff to assess and appropriately manage consumers with mental health issues.
The MHFA training improved the AEAs' ability to recognize a mental disorder, it increased their confidence level in providing help to someone with a mental health problem, it decreased social distances and positively changed their beliefs about treatment.
Buru is a category of wild and malevolent spirits that possess people in East Kwaio and induce antisocial and unexpected behaviour. Signs of buru possession include mutism, suicidal ideas, delusion, aggression and social isolation. Traditional healers practice indigenous treatments with 50% of people receiving treatments described as cured, 30% temporary cured and 20% no effect from treatment.
Participants identified specific theatre forms which they could use in their own health promotion practice. Several participants articulated a view that participant-oriented forms were more likely to influence health-related behaviour than performance-oriented forms, in their cultural context.
Interdisciplinary research on cultural literacy is shifting from cultural knowledge to intercultural know-how. This know-how translates into the individual's capacity to innovate and illustrates the influence of culture on individual and group performance.
The original 12 month open urban tribe formation (May 2004-June 2005) in Sydney led to regular gatherings where participants sought to come together and celebrate their being with each other until 2007. From that model further work was undertaken in Alice Springs in early 2008, applying a smaller version of this approach to a new community group. The narrative testimony and witnessing in the first group formed one element of what participants called 'the magic', which they commented on throughout their time together. It was their way of just being together (what this author calls their 'metaphorical energetic presence' alongside each other) that carried the power of this tribe's interactions. Mirroring and feeding back messages to each other that they belonged, that they had an identity, role and purpose together, was a key influence on wellness. That they were seen and loved by all participants was a vital element in the dynamic. These combined to create an effect dubbed 'Working the Business of Life' (WTBOL), a group sharing process providing practical feedback on how to maintain balance in life. By giving everyone a sense of being nurtured in their day-to-day lives, WTBOL showed that people of mixed consciousness can assist each other's healing, growth and development. The value in mixing people of different challenges was that it created a rich field of exchange of their beingness, and mutual appreciation and support. Each had compassion for the other's challenge, and this helped their own process of growing beyond their own challenges. The process has now been successfully applied in Peer Support Training Workshops for Consumers and Carers (November 2008 in Alice Springs).
Creative Recovery is a community-based arts initiative for Indigenous people with mental health problems. It has been rolled out as a pilot project in a remote Cape York community and is aimed at promoting wellbeing and recovery. The theoretical basis for the initiative is modelled on ideas of the role that social capital plays in improving mental health. This involves both the beneficial impact community participation and the social cohesion it creates can have, not only on an individual's mental health, but also on the social and emotional wellbeing of the communities they are part of. Such initiatives have already been adopted as an integral part of mental health promotion in countries such as the UK, and in other Australian states such as Victoria and Western Australia. The following paper will locate Creative Recovery in the current field of mental health promotion theory and Indigenous social and emotional wellbeing, and will discuss some of the evidence for and challenges inherent in adopting such initiatives.
The approach is described and preliminary data are presented supporting the importance of local production and participation.
To characterize further the functions of yeast eRF1 and eRF3, a genetic screen for their novel partner proteins was performed. As a result, the genes for gamma (TEF4 and TEF3/CAM1) and alpha (TEF5/EFB1) subunits of the translation elongation factor eEF1B, known to catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on eEF1A, were revealed. These genes act as dosage suppressors of a synthetic growth defect caused by some mutations in the SUP45 and SUP35 genes encoding eRF1 and eRF3, respectively. Extra copies of TEF5 and TEF3 can also suppress the temperature sensitivity of some sup45 and sup35 mutants and reduce nonsense codon readthrough caused by these omnipotent suppressors. Besides, overproduction of eEF1Balpha reduces nonsense codon readthrough in the strain carrying suppressor tRNA. Such effects were not shown for extra copies of TEF2, which encodes eEF1A, thus indicating that they were not due to eEF1A activation.
In total, 67 TB patients and 22 family members were interviewed and 6 FGDs were performed. According to their care seeking behavior patients were categorized into National TB program's (NTP) dream cases (18%), 'slow-but-sure patients' (34%), 'shopaholics' (45%), and the NTP's nightmare case (3%). Care seeking behavior patterns did not seem to be influenced by gender, place of residence and educational level. Factors that influenced care seeking behavior include income and advice from household members or friends. Family members based their recommendation on previous experience and affordability. FGD results suggest that the majority of people in the urban area preferred the hospital or chest clinic for diagnosis and treatment of TB whereas in the rural area private practitioners were preferred. Knowledge about TB treatment being free of charge was better in the urban area. Many community members from the rural area doubted whether TB treatment would be available free of charge.
Over 66 802 person years (17 316 after exposure to immunosuppressive drugs), 936 patients died (1.4/100 person years), 230 (24.6%) from cancer. For patients unexposed to immunosuppressive treatment, risks of death overall (standardised mortality ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.11) and from cancer (1.10, 0.93 to 1.29) were similar to those of the US population. Patients who used azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, systemic corticosteroids, or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs. In patients who used cyclophosphamide, overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was non-significantly increased. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with increased overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.98) and cancer mortality (adjusted HR 3.83, 1.13 to 13.01).
We found that N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and a monohydroxylated derivative of melatonin were the main products of the reaction between melatonin and ROO. Higher pH or saturation of the medium with molecular oxygen increased the yield of AFMK but did not affect the reaction rate. Melatonin increased the depletion of intracellular GSH mediated by AAPH. Using the HRP/H2O2 as the oxidant system, the addition of melatonin promoted the oxidation of GSH to GSSG.
End-tagging by hydrophobic amino acids yields increased potency of AMPs against P. aeruginosa, irrespective of bacterial proteinase production. Exemplifying this by two peptides from kininogen, GKHKNKGKKNGKHNGWK and KNKGKKNGKH, potency increased with tag length, correlating to more efficient bacterial wall and vesicle rupture, and to more pronounced P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide binding. End-tag effects remained at high electrolyte concentration and in the presence of plasma or anionic macromolecular scavengers. The tagged peptides displayed stability against P. aeruginosa elastase, and were potent ex vivo, both in a contact lens model and in a skin wound model.
Our data demonstrate that the increase of the membrane dipole potential caused by RH 421 decreases the activity and single-channel conductance of alamethicin. Surprisingly, we found that RH 421 increases the activity of melittin and magainin, suggesting that RH 421 may contribute via electrostatic repulsions, among others, to an increase in the monolayer spontaneous curvature of the membrane. We propose that RH 421-induced dipole potential and membrane elasticity changes alter the peptide-induced channel dynamics, and the prevalence of one mechanism over the other for particular classes of peptides is dictated by the electrical and mechanical interactions which rule the pore-formation mechanism of such peptides.
After application of the attractants l-lysine or food-related stimuli, the level of calcium in ASK neurons decreased. In contrast, responses increased upon stimulus removal. Opposite responses were observed after application and removal of a repellent.
Neu2 expression was unchanged in myotubes treated with TNF-alpha, a cytokine known to activate the proteasome. However, Neu2 transcript levels and enzymatic activity were downregulated in starved or dexamethasone-treated myotubes that showed proteosomal activation and several hallmarks of macroautophagy, such as formation of autophagosomes, the accumulation of LC3 dots and bulk degradation of long-lived proteins. Neu2 activity and protein levels were rescued upon cotreatment with the lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or cathepsin inhibitors, as well as by insulin administration, but were unaffected upon pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome. Moreover, HA- or GST-Neu2 recombinant fusion proteins were rapidly degraded in vitro by purified cathepsin L and B. Overall, we may conclude that Neu2 is degraded by lysosomal enzymes in myotubes undergoing autophagy-mediated atrophy.
Lysozyme nitration by PN or SIN-1 caused dose-dependent formation of 3-nitrotyrosine-lysozyme adducts, causing decreased catalytic activity, and enhanced susceptibility to degradation by the 20S proteasome. Kinetic analyses revealed an increased affinity by the 20S proteasome toward nitrated lysozyme compared with the native protein.
Kinetics follow-up of different catalase reactional intermediates shows that i) the formation of compound I always precedes that of verdoheme, ii) compound III is never observed, iii) the rate of compound II decomposition is not compatible with that of verdoheme formation, and iv) dithiothreitol prevents the verdoheme formation but not that of compound II, whereas NADPH prevents both of them. The formation of verdoheme is strongly inhibited by EDTA but not increased by Fe3+ or Cu2+ salts. The generation of verdoheme is facilitated by the presence of protein radicals as observed in the F194Y mutated catalase. The inability of the inactive variant (H54F) to form verdoheme, indicates that the heme oxidation is fully associated to the enzyme catalysis.
We show that p53 and damage-specific DNA binding protein 2 (ddb2) genes are up-regulated by morphine in a naloxone-sensitive manner. Furthermore, the results indicate that DNA damage, quantified by apurinic-apyrimidinic site counting assay and phosphorylation of Ser-15 in P53 protein, is induced in CD3+ T cells by morphine in a naloxone-sensitive manner.
Our data demonstrate for the first time that this lectin induces apoptosis through both death-receptor and mitochondrial pathways, as well as amplifies TNFalpha-induced L929 cell apoptosis.
Exposure to PLE resulted in an elevation of mtDeltapsi, and a decrease of ATP level in mitochondria. The ATP depletion owed to PLE-induced enhancement of mitochondrial F(0)F(1)-ATPase and inhibition of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases. These dysfunctions of mitochondria caused ROS accumulation in C. albicans, and this increase in the level of ROS production and PLE-induced decrease in cell viability were prevented by addition of L-cysteine, indicating that ROS was an important mediator of the antifungal action of PLE.
This technology resulted in efficient in vitro transfection, even in the cells which are difficult to transfect. The gene expression was dependent on the gene gun's helium pressure, the sizes of the gold particles, the amount of the particles and DNA loading, while cell viability was mostly dependent on helium pressure and amount of the gold particles.
Results of competition dialysis, absorption and fluorescence studies revealed that coralyne binds strongly to the polypurines, poly(G) and poly(I) compared to the polypyrimidines, poly(U) and poly(C). Partial intercalative binding due to the stacking of the molecules between the bases was envisaged. The binding was predominantly enthalpy driven with favourable entropy term with a large favourable non-electrostatic contribution revealed from salt dependent data and the dissection of the free energy. The heat capacity change of -125 and -119 cal/mol K(-1) respectively for poly(G) and poly(I) and the partial enthalpy-entropy compensation phenomenon observed confirmed the involvement of multiple weak noncovalent interactions. Circular dichroism studies provided evidence for significant perturbation of the conformation of the RNAs, but no self-structure induction was evident in any of the polymers under the condition of the study.
A significantly lower cone ERG maximal amplitude and lower rod sensitivity was found in SAD patients before light therapy compared with healthy participants. Following 4 weeks of light therapy, a normalization of cone and rod ERG function occurred. ERG parameters in the summer and melatonin concentrations in fall/winter were not significantly different between groups.
Ventral and dorsal GI decreased significantly with time in both cohorts; the rate did not differ for bipolar patients. Within the bipolar cohort, individuals with one or more BDNF met alleles showed greater losses in GI, an effect that correlated with gray matter loss in the left hemisphere.
EPO and EPOR were widely expressed in the brain albeit at low levels. Highest level of EPO and EPOR were in the choroid plexus and striatum, respectively. Peripheral administration of EPO was sufficient to produce a robust antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim and NIH tests. Gene expression profiles revealed that EPO induces the expression of neurotrophic genes such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, VGF (nonacronymic), and neuritin.
IL-6 in CSF was significantly higher in suicide attempters than in healthy control subjects. Patients who performed violent suicide attempts displayed the highest IL-6. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between MADRS scores and CSF IL-6 levels in all patients. IL-6 and TNF-alpha correlated significantly with 5-HIAA and HVA in CSF, but not with MHPG. Cytokine levels in plasma and CSF were not associated, and patients with increased blood-brain barrier permeability did not exhibit elevated cytokine levels.
The met158 allele was positively associated with gray matter volume in the left hippocampal head where genotype accounted for 59% of interindividual variance. In addition, the met158 allele was positively associated with neuronal responses to fearful relative to neutral facial expressions in the right parahippocampal gyrus where genotype accounted for 14% of the interindividual variance.
The bipolar depressed group demonstrated higher 5-HT1A BP(F) across all regions of interest (ROIs; p = .022). Post hoc analyses indicated that male BD patients had higher 5-HT1A BP(F) than male controls (p = .025), with higher 5-HT1A BP(F) found in every region (by 102% in raphe nuclei and 29% to 50% in the forebrain ROIs); whereas, female subgroups did not differ in 5-HT1A BP(F) (p = .32). Serotonin-1A BP(F) did not correlate with depression severity. The GG genotype was overrepresented at trend level in the BD group (p = .057). Number of G-allele copies was associated with higher 5-HT1A BP(F) in raphe (p = .0050), amygdala (p = .022), and hippocampus (p = .041).
Sixty healthy subjects carrying one or two copies of the short 5-HTTLPR allele (s/s and s/l) showed a significant reduction in short intracortical inhibition (SICI, p = .012) and an increased cortical silent period (p = .042) compared with 60 age- and sex-matched individuals homozygous for the long allele (l/l). In contrast, motor threshold and intracortical facilitation did not differ significantly between groups.
Relative to control subjects, individuals exposed to childhood adversity reported elevated symptoms of anhedonia and depression, rated reward cues less positively, and displayed a weaker response to reward cues in the left globus pallidus. There were no group differences in right hemisphere basal ganglia response to reward cues or in basal ganglia response to loss cues, no-incentive cues, gains, or penalties.
Significant decreases in depression in the CAT versus MED patients were seen within 48 hours of SD and were sustained over a 7-week period.
In control subjects compared with depressed older adults, greater citalopram-induced decreases in cerebral metabolism were observed in the right anterior cingulate, middle temporal (bilaterally), left precuneus, and left parahippocampal gyri. Greater decreases in the depressed older adults than control subjects were observed in left superior and left middle frontal gyri and increases in left inferior parietal lobule, left cuneus, left thalamus, and right putamen.
Compared with control subjects, in the LLD group there were widespread abnormalities in DTI parameters, particularly in prefrontal regions. From a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, the strongest correlations were observed between cognitive processing speed and DTI abnormalities.
Adolescents with BD had lower FA values than control subjects in the fornix, the left mid-posterior cingulate gyrus, throughout the corpus callosum, in fibers extending from the fornix to the thalamus, and in parietal and occipital corona radiata bilaterally. There were no significant between-group differences in trace or ADC values and no significant correlation between behavioral measures, medication exposure, and FA values.
A diagnosis x drug interaction was evident (p = .001), which was attributable to an increase in reaction time across all incentive levels after AMPT in RMDD subjects (p = .001) but no significant AMPT effect on reaction time in control subjects (p = .17). There was no drug x diagnosis interaction on control tasks involving working memory or attention. In the RMDD sample the AMPT-induced depressive symptoms correlated with AMPT-induced changes in reaction time at all incentive levels of the MID task (r values = .58-.82, p &lt; .002).
VGLUT1+/- mice showed increased neuronal synthesis of glutamate; decreased cortical and hippocampal GABA, VGLUT1, and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) as well as helplessness and anhedonia. CMS induced an increase of glutamate and a decrease of GABA, the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) in both areas and led to upregulation of EAAT1 in the hippocampus. Moreover, CMS induced anhedonia, helplessness, anxiety, and impaired recognition memory. VGLUT1+/- CMS mice showed a combined phenotype (genotype plus stress) and specific alterations, such as an upregulation of VGLUT2 and hyperlocomotion. Moreover, an increased vulnerability to anhedonia and helplessness reversible by chronic imipramine was shown.
Freud-2 RNA was widely distributed in brain and peripheral tissues. Freud-2 protein was enriched in the nuclear fraction of human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus but was weakly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Freud-2 immunostaining was co-localized with 5-HT1A receptors, neuronal and glial markers. In prefrontal cortex, Freud-2 was expressed at similar levels in control and depressed male subjects. Recombinant hFreud-2 protein bound specifically to 5' or 3' human DRE adjacent to the Freud-1 site. Human Freud-2 showed strong repressor activity at the human 5-HT1A or heterologous promoter in human HEK-293 5-HT1A-negative cells and neuronal SK-N-SH cells, a model of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-positive cells. Furthermore, small interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous hFreud-2 expression de-repressed 5-HT1A promoter activity and increased levels of 5-HT1A receptor protein in SK-N-SH cells.
Severe hypoxia was present in the bony epiphysis and the lower part of the epiphyseal cartilage following ischemia. In the bony epiphysis, extensive cell death and tissue necrosis was observed with degradation of proteins and RNAs which precluded further analysis. In the epiphyseal cartilage, the loss of cell viability was limited to its deep layer with the remainder of the cartilage remaining viable. Furthermore, the cartilage from the ischemic side showed a significant increase in HIF-1alpha protein level and HIF-1alpha expression. VEGF expression in the cartilage was dramatically and significantly increased at 24 h, 2 and 4 weeks (p&lt;0.05 for all) with 5 to 10 fold increase being observed on the ischemic side compared to the normal side. PECAM and VEGFR2 expressions in the cartilage were both significantly decreased at 24 h but returned to the normal levels by 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Micro-CT showed revascularization of the cartilage on the ischemic side with the vessel volume/total volume equaling the normal side by 4 weeks.
Among the 209 women, 48 were found to have at least one radiographic vertebral fracture, which yielded a prevalence of 23% (95%CI: 18-29%). Although fracture occurred in all vertebrae, most (83%) occurred at the L1-L5. Most fractures occurred at one vertebra, and only 12% occurred at multiple vertebrae. The prevalence increased with age such that it reached 39% among those aged 70+ years. There was no significant association between vertebral fracture and back pain, fall history, and dietary calcium intake. In simple log-binomial regression analysis, higher risk of vertebral fracture was associated with advancing age (prevalence ratio [PR] per 10 years: 1.40; 1.16-2.05) and lower lumbar spine BMD (PR per SD: 1.51; 1.18-1.92). In multivariable analysis, the two factors remained independently associated with fracture risk, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.66.
Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome was genetically confirmed by detection of the mutation Asp767Tyr in the androgen receptor gene. Bone size at presentation was found to be intermediate between male and female reference values. Low areal and volumetric bone density (both trabecular and cortical) was observed at baseline and improved gradually with estrogen treatment (+2% to 6.5%). Upon estrogen treatment, endosteal contraction (-1%) was demonstrated, with increasing cortical thickness (+3%), cortical area (+5%) and unchanged periosteal circumference.
The highest relative Sr content was found in patients who had been treated for 7-8 years. The variability was pronounced; a mean of 1.1 % Sr was measured at the end of treatment. No effect was demonstrated on distal radius relative bone Ca hydroxy apatite. Bone strontium uptake and retention data were compatible with a power function model. Withdrawal of SrR resulted in a decline in bone Sr, but 73 %Sr and 67 %Sr, respectively remained in UD-radius three and six months after drug withdrawal.
The NK1 receptor was expressed in both BMSCs and BMMs. SP stimulated the proliferation of BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations (10(-12) M) of SP stimulated alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin expression, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, and up-regulated Runx2 protein levels, and higher concentrations of SP (10(-8) M) enhanced mineralization in differentiated BMSCs. SP also stimulated BMSCs to produce RANKL, but at concentrations too low to evoke osteoclastogenesis in co-culture with macrophages in the presence of SP. SP also activated NF-kappaB in BMMs and directly facilitate RANKL-induced macrophage osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption activity.
Backward linear regression analysis was performed for individual groups, with age, gender, Tanner stage, weight, height, body composition (lean and fat mass), acylated ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, leptin, glucose, insulin, and IGF-1, entered into the model. In healthy children, acylated ghrelin was a significant and independent negative predictor of WB BMD, and WB BMC/height, while lean mass was positively associated significantly with these bone measures. In contrast, in obese children, a positive significant association was observed between des-acyl ghrelin and WB BMD as well as WB BMC/height, along with lean mass, and to a lesser degree, with fat mass. Acylated as well as des-acyl ghrelin were not significant predictors of LS BMD and LS BMAD in obese as well as control children.
American blacks had higher vBMD at the femoral neck and femoral shaft cortex than American whites whereas femoral axis length and femoral neck area were not different. Men had lower vBMD at the femoral neck and femoral cortex than women but had greater femoral axis length and femoral neck area than women. The higher aBMD in American blacks than whites persisted after correction for measured area whereas the higher aBMD in men than women disappeared.
One hundred and twenty three patients were included. The mean (+/-SD) T-score was -0.31+/-1.24 at the spine and -0.19+/-1.11 at the left femoral neck. 36% had osteopenia and 4.1% had osteoporosis at either site. Four patients had vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D levels were not correlated with BMD. Twenty-five patients had vitamin D insufficiency. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified low body mass index (BMI) and male sex as risk factors for low BMD at the spine and low BMI and duration of treatment as risk factors for low BMD at the left femoral neck.
At 4 weeks postoperative bone surface volume fraction (BS/TV) using rhBMP-2 was higher than with use of COLLOSS E and autograft, while trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) was lower using rhBMP-2 at this time-point. At eight weeks BS/TV and trabecular number (Tb.N.) were still higher using rhBMP-2 than autograft and COLLOSS E. Connectivity density was significantly higher using rhBMP-2 than using autograft or COLLOSS E at both time-points. Between four- and eight-week time-points BV/TV and Tb.Th. rose while Tb.N. declined using rhBMP-2. The degree of anisotropy and the calculated amount of trabeculae with main direction along the spinal axis, were higher at four weeks using COLLOSS E. rhBMP-2 had the highest amount of trabeculae directed along the spinal axis at eight weeks. A change in main direction between four and eight weeks was observed for both autograft and rhBMP-2. The numerical results from the finite element model verify that significantly different flow pattern emerges as the boundary conditions are altered. At four weeks there was an evident correlation between trabecular orientation and flow pattern using rhBMP-2.
We observed significantly less intracortical inhibition (SICI) in children's M1 compared to that of adults. Adolescents showed significantly less SICI at the 5 ms interval than did adults. No significant differences were apparent in intracortical facilitation (ICF).
All asymptomatic CALD showed normal FIQ. PIQ was significantly lower than VIQ in 2 patients. Occipital lesioned patients often showed normal VIQ with low PIQ. Gestalt Closure in The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and Constancy of Shape in the Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception seemed to be effective for detecting visual cognitive dysfunction in asymptomatic CALD whose difference of VIQ and PIQ was within the normal range.
After a 38-month median follow-up, the 3-year bDFS rates were: 60 and 72% for ASTRO and Phoenix (nadir+2 ng/ml) definitions respectively. According to univariate analysis, pre-RT PSA&gt; or =1 ng/ml and seminal vesicle involvement were associated with biochemical relapse. Multivariate analysis retained only pre-RT PSA&gt; or =1 ng/ml as an independent predictor of biochemical relapse for the two definitions.
LVEF at pre-RT were normal in 54 pts (100%, three Missing Data [MD]), at post-RT in 56 pts (98%, no MD) and at last follow-up in 53 pts (95%, one MD). There were two grade 0, 44 grade I and 11 grade II skin reactions. For the 27 patients with a skin toxicity assessment after six months, late skin toxicity was grade 0 in 22 pts, grade 1 in four, grade 2 in one.
Three hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled over two years in the economic study, corresponding to 197 radiotherapy treatments without RG and 168 with RG. Patients treated during the learning phase (n=27) were excluded from the comparison with the control group. The use of RG in routine practice induced a cost increase of respectively euro1256 and euro996 per treatment for lung and breast cancer patients treated with breath-hold techniques, versus euro1807 and euro1510 for lung and breast cancer patients treated with synchronized gating techniques. Overcosts were mainly due to extra working time of medical staff and medical technicians and to extra use of equipment during treatment sessions.
Complete histological local-regional response was obtained in 56% of the pts (n=39). Residual macroscopic or microscopic disease in the cervix was observed in 28 pts (40%). All but one had in situ microscopic residual CC. Lateral residual disease in the parametria was also present in nine pts, all with residual CC. Pelvic lymph nodes were free from microscopic disease in 56 pts (80%). Eight of 55 (11%) radiological N0 patients had microscopic nodal involvement, as compared to 6/15 (40%) radiological N1 (p=0.03). Seventeen pts (25%) had residual cervix disease but negative nodes. After median follow-up of 40 months (range, 8-141), 38/70 patients (54.1%) are still alive and free of disease, six (8.6%) alive with disease, and 11 (15.8%) patients were lost for follow-up but free of disease.
Median age at diagnosis was 52 years (20-64 years). Breast surgery was conservative in five patients (20%). Surgical margins were wide (&gt; 10mm), narrow, involved or unknown in respectively 17 (68%), three (12%), three (12%) and two (8%) patients. Median tumour size was 65 mm (12-250 mm). Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered in seven (28%) patients (two patients, post-tumorectomy; five patients, post-mastectomy) and 13 patients (52%) received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Five-year overall survival rate was 91% (95% CI, 80-100%). Five patients (20%) developed distant metastases (one after chemotherapy) and three (12%) locoregional relapse (one after tumorectomy and unknown margin without radiotherapy, two after mastectomy and involved margins with radiotherapy).
Fifty patients (41 males, 9 females) were included. A total of 35 (70%) patients received the planned total dose of 74Gy. Patients irradiated to inferior doses interrupted the treatment because of limiting toxicities. Induction and concurrent chemotherapy was delivered to 39 (78%) and 14 (28%) patients, respectively. Eight (16%) patients experienced grade 3-4 acute lung toxicity, all of them having a history of pulmonary disease, a FEV1 below 1.6 L, and a lung V(20) of at least 25%. Three (6%) patients were deemed to experience radiation-induced cardiac toxicity.
Amyloid deposits were successfully subtyped as AL, AH, or AA amyloid by immunofluorescence in 82% of cardiac specimens and 87% of renal specimens. In all cases, the amyloid classification was in good agreement with available clinical and laboratory assessments. A cross-study analysis of 163 cases of AL amyloidosis reveals probable systemic misdiagnosis of cardiac AL amyloidosis by the immunoperoxidase technique, but not by the immunofluorescence technique.
The proteoglycans decorin, biglycan, and versican were more abundant in myxomatous valves than in normal controls (P&lt;.03). There was a gender effect on proteoglycan presence, but no age-related trends were observed. Hyaluronan and the hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis were distributed throughout all valves. There was no significant difference in hyaluronan between groups, but expression of the hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis was reduced in myxomatous valves compared to normal controls (P&lt;.002).
The nine cases of isolated PVIE formed 5.8% of the IE cases, seen in six males and three females, largely adults. Seven patients (77.8%) had admissions for about 24 h. Hospital admission was sought for mainly progressive shortness of breath (66.7%) and fever (44.4%). Congenital heart disease was seen in seven (77.8%); two (an infant and an adult) had normal hearts. A single blood sample for blood culture in two patients was negative. Two-dimensional echocardiography, performed in eight, revealed vegetations on the pulmonary valve in four. The pulmonary valve was tricuspid in six cases, bicuspid in two, and unicuspid in one. The vegetations (active in three, active and healing in two, healed in four) were accompanied by concomitant thickening, shortening, perforations, or complete destruction of the cusps. Involvement of the right ventricular outflow tract or the main pulmonary artery was identified in five hearts. Five patients (55.6%) developed pulmonary complications, related to the endocarditis.
Histological examination showed the presence of various degrees of fibromuscular hyperplasia with fibrosis of the right (six cases), left (five cases) or both (one case) pulmonary arteries.
The presence of replacement fibrosis in the apical core tissue significantly correlated with decreased improvement in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure after left ventricular assist device placement (P=.02). Ten subjects died over the course of this study. No specimen variables, including scar, interstitial fibrosis, and the presence of mural thrombosis, correlated with patient mortality.
Among the 19 adults, there were six males and 13 females, with age ranging from 26 to 75 years. The patients most often presented with dyspnea, fatigability, and palpitation for 3 months to 2 years. Four patients (21%) had other congenital heart disease in association with the DSM; in the rest, the membranes were isolated occurrences (79%). A cardiac murmur or the presence of membranes had been noted in childhood in four patients. Tissue growths over the ventricular surface of the anterior mitral leaflet were seen in 18 cases. Irrespective of the gross appearance, the stenosing lesions exhibited five tissue layers, beginning from the luminal aspect, endothelium, acid mucopolysaccharide-rich subendothelial layer, collagen-rich fibrous layer, fibroelastotic layer, and a smooth muscle layer. Twelve patients (63%) had aortic regurgitation, which necessitated repair or replacement in seven. Septal myectomy resulted in conduction abnormalities in nine.
The dual-compartment air cushion yielded lower readings for all pressure parameters analyzed (P(max), P(mean), P(sd), and P(isch)) than the other three cushion models (P&lt;0.05). The best surface parameter results (S(tot), S&gt;60 and %S&gt;60) also were obtained with the dual-compartment air cushion (P&lt;0.05).
All types of crosslinked polyethylene produced statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) lower wear rates than the conventional UHMWPEs without any traces of fatigue. There were no differences in the wear rates between fixed-and mobile-bearings (crosslinked polyethylenes and UHMWPEs; P&gt;0.05). The crosslinked polyethylene tibial inserts manufactured by sequential irradiation and annealing (X3) combined with the Scorpio-knee-design had the lowest wear rates (P&lt;0.05) overall.
During two-crutch versus one-crutch walking, speed was lower (P=0041), stride time and step time were longer (P=0.004 and P=0.005) and there were fewer strides/minute and steps/minute (P=0.005 and P=0.006). The duration of the single support stance was longer during two-crutch walking (P=0.008). With respect to the articular parameters, both ankle ROMs (dorsi-plantar flexion P=0.003 and pronation-supination P=0.004) were greater with one-crutch walking than with two-crutch walking.
All four groups demonstrated evidence of failure at similar loads (21.8-26.1N). The locked group was able to tolerate significantly higher loads overall (37.3N, P=.044). All three non-locked groups demonstrated similar failure patterns and load to failure. Locking constructs demonstrated a distinctly different failure pattern. No significant differences were detected with regard to screw orientation and load to failure. The group with an oblique end screw was significantly less stiff than the other three constructs (P=.017).
The mode of failure involved the midsubstance of the anterior cruciate ligament in all the specimens. There were no statistically significant differences in the stiffness and ultimate load to failure values between the three groups (P&gt;0.05). The energy to failure values were evaluated and there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P=0.064, chi-square=3.43). In the histologic analyses, there was a significant difference in the hyalinization values between the hyaluronic acid and saline groups (P=0.029) and between the hyaluronic acid group and control groups (P=0.029).
In addition to the expected bias between the rotation angle time-histories, very different patterns and range of motion were found between the models. In chair rising/sitting, and in the laboratory global frame, the range of flexion averaged over the subjects was measured by the different models in the full scale from about 28 degrees to 44 degrees. In elementary trunk rotation and in the pelvis anatomical reference frame, three models measured about 10 degrees excursion of the coupled bending motion, other two about 38 degrees and 49 degrees on average.
Our results showed that a nonlinear measure, the largest Lyapunov exponent, was the only parameter of postural sway that revealed significant differences between infants with typical versus delayed development. The largest Lyapunov exponent was found to be higher for typically developing infants, indicating less repeated patterning in their movement coordination.
Contrary to somewhat similar external moments (with differences &lt;11 Nm) as well as comparable compression forces at the L4-S1 joints (&lt;20% except in the heaviest task with 52% difference) and sum of all trunk muscle forces (&lt;26% except in the heaviest task with 44% difference), both models recruited trunk global and local lumbar muscles in markedly different proportions (ratio of total global over total local muscle forces in cases with load in hands remained &gt;2.4 in the KD model whereas &lt;1.0 in the EMGAO model) which in turn led to significantly different shear force estimates. Results of the EMGAO model were level dependent. Estimated L4-L5 intradiscal pressures were comparable to the measured data except for the heaviest task in which case the EMGAO model overestimated the measured pressure by 67%.
Injuries were to the anterior cruciate ligament in three knees and the medial collateral ligament in seven knees. The mean (standard deviation) peak bending moment at failure was 107 (64)Nm. Valgus bending produced regions of contact on the lateral tibial plateau with average maximum pressures of approximately 30 (8)MPa. Cartilage fissures and subchondral bone microcracks were observed in these regions of high contact pressure.
All LM patients showed intrathecal synthesis for at least one TM. In one patient, a negative CSF cytology after treatment paralleled normalization of tumor marker synthesis. None of the OND patients displayed intrathecal TM synthesis. The VEGF Index (CSF/serum VEGF relative to CSF/serum albumin ratios) was significantly higher in LM patients compared with the control group. However, significant overlap between LM patients and values seen in those with OND was observed.
No significant differences were found when cTnI concentrations of 40 lithium-heparin plasma samples were compared with the matched values of K(2)-EDTA plasma, whole blood and serum samples. The LoB and the LoD of the cTnI method were 0.0048 and 0.0066 microg/L, respectively. cTnI mean values from 0.66 to 6.0 microg/L showed a total CV% from 6.0 to 6.4. cTnI at a concentration of 0.02 microg/L was associated with a total CV of 9.6%. The method gave a linear response for cTnI concentrations within the measurement range. In six of 12 samples containing HA, a positive interference was demonstrated. The 99th percentile limit of the cTnI distribution in the reference population was 0.013 microg/L.
The Hp 1-1 phenotype was associated with a lower EBV antibody titer (p=0.0005).
Serum UA concentrations were found to be significantly lower in MS patients compared with controls (p=0.019). CSF UA concentrations were lower in MS patients as compared to controls, as well as in patients with active MS (clinical and/or MRI activity) in comparison to patients with inactive MS or controls, but these differences were not statistically significant. Significant correlation was found between CSF and serum UA concentrations (p=0.016) in MS patients, but not in controls; and between CSF UA concentrations and the CSF/serum albumin quotient in MS patients (p=0.043), but not in controls.
The present investigation demonstrated direct and reliable detection of telomerase activity of circulating blood leukocytes.
The use of highly sensitive slides correctly identified fetal paternally inherited alleles without any enrichment strategy.
The detection limit for this assay was 0.01 ng/mL. Functional sensitivity (inter-assay imprecision &lt; or = 20%) was 0.015 ng/mL at a coefficient of variation (%CV) of 11.2%. Total imprecision was below 6.5% CV. The assay was linear upon dilution. Comparison with the ADVIA Centaur C-Peptide assay yielded a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99.
Total coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 1.9% to 7.8% for individual drugs, and from 3.2% to 8.6% for drugs of abuse testing. Results from proficiency test samples were between 81% and 125% of the consensus mean for therapeutic drugs. Method comparisons (Passing-Bablok regression) showed overall good comparability to MODULAR ANALYTICS SWA and COBAS INTEGRA 800 systems, with slopes from 0.93 to 1.17 and correlation coefficients r &gt; 0.98. Imprecision in a simulated routine run was tested using a total of 42 methods (10 therapeutic drug monitoring, 9 drugs of abuse testing, 3 enzymes, 12 substrates, 8 specific protein assays). Imprecision in the reference batch run ranged from 0.7% to 5.0% CV for therapeutic drug monitoring assays, except for digoxin (DIG) (7.3%), and from 0.9% to 7.7% for drugs of abuse testing. The CVs of general clinical chemistry and specific protein tests were within the expected limits of 2% and 4%. CV changes in the simulated routine run were within the expected limits for most assays. Negative DeltaCVs (&gt; or = 2%) for DIG, digitoxin (DIGIT), cannabinoids (THC), and phencyclidine (PCP) may indicate improved performance when running these assays in a simulated routine operation. A positive DeltaCV (&gt; or = 3%) was found for amphetamines (AMPHs).
The levels of RhoA and RhoC mRNA transcripts in carcinoma tissues were significantly higher than those in the matched paratumor and normal tissues from the same patient (p&lt;0.05). The expression levels of both genes were significantly correlated with metastasis of cancer cells to lymph nodes and liver (p&lt;0.05). The levels of RhoA expression were significantly correlated with the histopathological degree of cancer, while the expression of RhoC was correlated with the extent of local invasion to intestine.
Anti-CCP antibody level was positive in 70% of RA patients, 8.5% of HCV-infected patients, and in 20% of HCV patients with articular manifestations. RF was positive in 76% of RA patients and in 60% of HCV patients with articular involvement. Cryoglobulins were found in 29% of HCV-infected patients and in 16% of RA patients. Cryoglobulins were more frequent among HCV patients with articular affection (35%) compared to HCV patients without articular affection (26%).
Among the 10 OH-PAHs, eight had significant positive correlations with serum GGT. These correlations were similarly observed in men and women, and in individuals under 60 years of age. Unlike serum GGT, alanine aminotransferase, another liver enzyme, was not associated with OH-PAHs.
The distribution of CRP was highly skewed toward lower concentrations. CRP was higher in men than women, and the cut-off thresholds for the high-risk tertile of CRP concentrations corresponded to 1.01 mg/L in men and 0.62 mg/L in women, based on the current study population. Age, male gender, cigarette smoking, physical activity, body mass index, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and uric acid were independently associated with CRP concentrations.
The cohort comprised 715 patients (mean age, 61 +/- 6.5 y; 59% male; 95% Caucasian) with 10,492 patient-years of follow-up. There were 12 cases of CRC: 5 found at baseline and 7 found after a median follow-up period of 8 years (range, 3-16 y). When the first 2 years of follow-up were excluded, there were 7 incident cases of CRC (95% confidence interval [CI], 2-13) over 9075 person-years of follow-up. The expected number based on SEER data was 21. The incidence rate was 0.77 cases per 1000 person-years, and the standardized incidence ratio was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.10-0.62), consistent with a relative risk reduction in CRC incidence of 67%. Three patients died from CRC (95% CI, 0-9). The expected number of deaths based on SEER data was 9. The mortality rate was 0.29 per 1000 person-years, and the standardized mortality ratio was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.0-1.06), consistent with a relative reduction in CRC death of 65%.
A total of 2245 BE surveillance cases were identified with linked endoscopy reports that recorded BE length and could be assessed for adherence. Adherence to guidelines was seen in 51.2% of cases. In multivariable analysis, longer segment BE was associated with significantly reduced adherence (3-5 cm, odds ratio [OR] 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.19; 6-8 cm, OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03-0.09; &gt; or =9 cm, OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.07). Stratified by BE length, nonadherence was associated with significantly decreased dysplasia detection (summary OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.82).
In 25 of 39 patients (64%) on therapy, impedance testing was normal, with a median of 69 events (interquartile, 63.0-78.0). The percentage of time at pH &lt;4 was within the normal range for all patients who were on therapy. The pH test results were abnormal in 28 of 39 patients (72%) when studied off therapy. Ninety-three of patients with abnormal impedance on therapy also had abnormal acid reflux off therapy. When both groups were off therapy, the patients with abnormal impedance parameters on therapy had significantly higher median (interquartile) 2-day baseline levels of esophageal acid exposure (8.7%, 6.9%-12.5%), compared with those of patients with normal impedance parameters while on therapy (6.0%, 2.8%-9.4%; P = .026).
Seventeen of 98 patients (17%) with NASH cirrhosis were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean age was 63 years, and 70% were male. Six patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma incidentally on explant. Survival after liver transplantation was 88% after mean follow-up of 2.5 years. The number of NASH patients known to have hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplantation was greater than the number of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis/primary sclerosing cholangitis and comparable to the number of patients with alcoholic liver disease and HCV.
We analyzed autopsy data from 10,345 adults (age &gt; or =21 years), 1337 children (1-20 years), and 4470 infants (&lt;1 year). Iron overload without reports of excessive exogenous iron was observed in 18 adults; the prevalence in whites and blacks was 0.0019 and 0.0015, respectively (P = .6494). Twenty-nine adults and 2 children had iron overload with reports of excessive exogenous iron. In adults, the prevalences of iron overload with reports of excessive exogenous iron in whites and blacks were 0.0040 and 0.0013, respectively (P = .0107). Among adults, the prevalence of cirrhosis was 6-fold greater in those with iron overload. In adults with severe iron overload, 67% without reports of excessive exogenous iron and 14% with reports of excessive exogenous iron died of hepatic failure or cardiomyopathy caused by siderosis. The overall prevalence of deaths caused by severe iron overload in whites and blacks was 0.0021 and 0.0009, respectively (P = .0842).
During a mean 9-month follow-up, 26 (17%) patients died, and 30 (20%) received liver transplants. In unadjusted analysis, higher baseline HRQOL predicted lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-0.99). Specifically, for each 1-point increase in HRQOL, there was a 4% decrease in mortality. These results did not change after adjusting for MELD scores, patient demographics, or psychosocial characteristics; the MELD score accounted for 1% of the variation in HRQOL scores (P = .18). Survival was most strongly predicted by activities of daily living, health distress, sleep disturbance, and perceived disease stigma.
All patients were ethnically Chinese, and 97% were born in Asia. HBsAg testing was available in 64% (3012/4671) of cases. The HBsAg seroprevalence rate was 11.1% (335/3012) overall and 14.9% in persons aged 30-39 years. HBeAg testing was available for 75% (250/335) of HBsAg+ cases. Seventy-five percent (188/250) were HBeAg-. Sixty percent (26/43) of HBeAg+ patients with available data had HBV DNA &gt;10(5) copies/mL and an elevated ALT level. Sixteen percent (21/128) of HBeAg- patients with available data had HBV DNA &gt;10(4) copies/mL and an elevated ALT level.
Of the patients with cirrhosis identified, 2.8% left their hospital against medical advice. Self-discharge was most common in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (4.2%) and hepatitis B or C ( approximately 3%) and least common among those with chronic cholestasis (0.4%). Independent predictors of self-discharge included male sex, younger age, non-private insurance, and admission to urban, nonteaching hospitals. Patients undergoing surgery and those with more comorbidities were less likely to leave against medical advice, whereas those with human immunodeficiency virus, drug and alcohol abuse, or psychosis were more likely to leave against medical advice. Self-discharge was less common among patients with hepatic decompensation (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.82), primary liver cancer (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41-0.59), or prior transplantation (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55). Length of stay and hospital charges were lower in patients discharged against medical advice (P &lt; .0001).
Intraobserver/interobserver blinded evaluations demonstrated a significant difference (P &lt; .001) between scores of samples taken from control subjects, from patients with esophageal eosinophilia who had a diagnosis of EoE, and from patients with GERD (P &lt; .001). This algorithm also was able to identify patients whose clinical course was suggestive of a diagnosis of EoE, but that nonetheless failed to reach the critical threshold number of &gt; or =15 eosinophils in a high-power (40x) microscopy field.
Endoscopies detected abnormalities in 635 patients (23%). The most common findings were reflux esophagitis with erosions (15%), gastric ulcers (2.7%), and duodenal ulcers (2.3%). The prevalence of upper gastrointestinal malignancy was 0.22%. If all dyspeptic patients 50 years or older underwent endoscopy, 1 esophageal cancer and no gastric cancers would have been missed. If the age threshold for endoscopy were set at 50 years, at a cost of $500/endoscopy, it would cost $82,900 (95% CI, $35,714-$250,000) to detect each case of cancer.
At 1 year, 70.9% of the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily remained in remission vs 58.9% of the group given 1 g mesalamine twice daily; this difference was statistically significant (P = .024), indicating the increased efficacy of once daily, compared with twice daily, dosing. Self-reported adherence to therapy, measured by visual analog scale score after 4, 8, and 12 months, was significantly greater in the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily, compared with twice daily, at all but 1 study visit (P &lt; .05). Compliance measured by medication taken was not significantly different between the groups. The difference between the 2 groups in overall incidence of adverse events was not statistically significant (P = .23).
The sensitivity of FDG-PET was higher for nodal staging than that of CT (87.8% vs. 61.6%, respectively). FDG-PET was also more sensitive than CT in regard to evaluating the extranodal organs for lymphomatous involvement (96.2% vs. 40.0%, respectively). FDG-PET detected all 16 patients who were characterized by a positive bone marrow biopsy and identified an additional 4 patients with bone marrow disease. The incorporation of FDG-PET coupled with CCS in the staging procedure upstaged 20% (17/82) of the patients and downstaged 11% (9/82) of the patients. As a result of these changes in staging, 15% (13/82) of the patients would have received a different therapeutic regimen.
The echoendoscope could not traverse tumoral esophageal stenosis to perform EUS in two patients, and invasion was effectively diagnosed by EBUS. In 4 (57%) of 7 patients EBUS revealed additional information to staging. In the remaining 3 cases the invasion findings were the same under both EUS and EBUS.
Isoflavone treatment resulted in a 9.46% increase in the thickness of the epidermis in 23 patients. In addition, the papillary index was reduced in 21 women. The papillary index was inversely proportional to skin wrinkling, i.e., there were a large number of papillae after treatment. The amount of collagen in the dermis was increased in 25 women (86.2%). In 22 women (75.8%) we observed that the number of elastic fibers increased. The number of dermal blood vessels was significantly increased in 21 women.
We present partial results of this allocation procedure as well as simulated data. In the clinical trial for which this procedure was developed, successful balancing between treatment arms was achieved. Separately, in an exploratory analysis, we found that if the arrival order of patients was altered, most patients were allocated to a different treatment arm than their original assignment.
The increase in lung function in the double-lung transplant group was more substantial than that of the single-lung transplant group, exhibiting a statistical difference from the 1st month in both the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) in comparison to the pre-transplant values (p &lt;0.05). Comparison between double-lung transplant and single lung-transplant groups of emphysema patients demonstrated a significant difference in lung function beginning in the 3rd month after transplantation.
A moderate concordance (0.51) was found between the results from the Peritron and Neurodyn perineometers, a fair concordance (0.21) between the Peritron and SensuPower brands and a poor concordance (0.19) between the Neurodyn and SensuPower brands.
Patients (n = 529) were submitted to a total of 776 thoracotomies. Median follow-up time across all patients was 21.6 months (range: 0-192 months). The postoperative complication rate was 9.3%, and the 30-day mortality rate was 0.2%. The ninety-month overall survival rate for all patients was 30.4%. Multivariate analysis identified the number of pulmonary nodules detected on preoperative CT-scan, the number of malignant nodules resected, and complete resection as the independent prognostic factors for overall survival.
All patients were less than 4 years (yrs) of age, with a mean age of 2.08 +/- 1.23 yrs. The mean duration of follow-up was 5.49 +/- 3.09 yrs. The difference in success rates among the three surgical procedures at 1, 3, 6 and 9 yrs was not statistically significant (p = 0.492). However, in patients with over 4 yrs of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the success rates of trabeculectomy and CTT declined more slowly than that of trabeculotomy. Among the patients, 66.22% acquired good vision (VA &gt; 0.4), 17.57% acquired fair vision (VA = 0.1 - 0.3), and 16.22% acquired poor vision (VA &lt; 0.1). The patients with good vision were mostly in the successful surgery group. Myopia was more prevalent postoperatively (p = 0.009). Reductions in the cup-disc ratio and corneal diameter were only seen in the successful surgery group (p = 0.000). In addition, the successful surgery group contained more patients that complied with a regular follow-up routine (p = 0.002).
By the end of the follow-up period, the survival rates for the IT and CT groups were, respectively, 71.9% versus 47.2% in the global population (hazard ratio=0.55, P&lt;0.001), 81.5% versus 66.6% in the YG (hazard ratio=0.68, P=0.018) and 48.8% versus 20.3% in the EG (hazard ratio=0.58, P&lt;0.001). In the adjusted models, the hazard ratios were 0.62 (P&lt;0.001) in the global population, 0.74 in the YG (P=0.073) and 0.64 (P=0.001) in the EG.
One hour of exposure to the phone did not significantly change facial temperature in either group of rats. No significant difference was observed in total sperm count between controls and RF-EMR exposed groups. However, rats exposed to RF-EMR exhibited a significantly reduced percentage of motile sperm. Moreover, RF-EMR exposure resulted in a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and low GSH content in the testis and epididymis.
Bursting pressures and hydroxyproline contents for the Famotidine Group were significantly lower than the equivalent parameters for the Control Group on both the third and seventh days post-surgery.
Out of 1253 records retrieved from the five databases, 604 original articles and reviews were analyzed; of these, 246 (41%) articles were published in national journals and 221 (90%) of those were in journals with free online access through SciELO or their own websites. Of the 358 articles published in international journals, 333 (93%) had controlled online access and 223 (67%) were available through the Capes Portal of Journals. The average impact of each article for InCor was 2.224 in the period studied.
Immunized rabbits presented a significant increase in collagen in skin collected seven days after the first immunization (p=0.05).
Increasing tidal volumes led to a reduction in %RAH for all heat and moisture exchangers while no significant effect was demonstrated in the context of varying respiratory rate or inspiratory flow.
The overall mortality rate was 69%. Blood loss was significantly higher in the hypertonic-hyperoncotic hydroxyethyl starch and normal saline groups than in the terlipressin, hypertonic NaCl and placebo-treated controls groups (p&lt;0.005). Hyperkalemia (K&gt;5 mmol/L) before any treatment occurred in 66% of the patients (80% among non-survivors vs. 22% among survivors, p=0.019). Post-resuscitation hyperkalemia occurred in 86.66% of non-survivors vs. 0% of survivors (p&lt;0.001). Hyperkalemia was the first sign of an unsuccessful outcome for the usual resuscitative procedure and was not related to arterial acidemia. Successfully resuscitated animals showed a significant decrease in serum potassium levels relative to the baseline value.
A two-model approach to specifying and generating a screen representation for archetype-based information, inspired by the two-model approach of archetypes, was developed. There is a separation between software-related display knowledge and domain-related display knowledge and the toolkit is designed with the reuse of components in mind.
A delay of radiotherapy more than 8-12 weeks after surgery adversely affects local recurrence. Radiotherapy should be administered within 7 months after surgery, when chemotherapy is administered first. Several chemotherapy regimens can be safely administered concurrently with radiotherapy. The concurrent use of tamoxifen with chemotherapy should be avoided, but not with radiotherapy. Data is insufficient with regard to concurrent use of aromatase inhibitors with radiotherapy. The use of trastuzumab concomitantly with radiotherapy may enhance toxicities but may also improve its efficacy.
Seven days after transplantation, the plasma creatinine levels in the CS and MP groups were still significantly elevated above the baseline values. In the ROP group, all animals exhibited nearly normal creatinine levels. Malondialdehyde, an indicator of lipidperoxidation, was dramatically increased in the machine perfused kidneys on day 7, whereas the malondialdehyde levels in the other two groups were near normal values. The MP kidneys exhibited the most striking histological changes.
Meta-analyses have demonstrated that fever at onset and in the acute setting after ischemic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest have a negative impact on morbidity and mortality. There are data to support that the impact of fever is sustained for longer durations after subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. However, there are currently no prospective randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of fever control in these patient populations.
Modern imaging studies have confirmed the dynamic nature of ICH. At least one-third of patients experience significant continued bleeding and hematoma expansion in the first few hours after onset, more so in warfarin-related ICH. Despite a strong biological rationale for benefit, a large clinical trial of recombinant activated factor VII failed to show any treatment effects on substantive outcomes despite clear attenuation of hematoma growth. The impact of recombinant activated factor VII is therefore severely restricted because of uncertain efficacy, definite hazard, and high cost. Accumulating evidence indicates beneficial effects from the early normalization of international normalized ratio levels and replacement of coagulation factors in warfarin-related ICH. Although high blood pressure (BP) is common and associated with poor outcomes in ICH, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific early BP management strategy, although recent randomized evidence indicates that such treatment is well tolerated and readily incorporated into routine clinical practice. Definitive evidence to support a low-cost, widely applicable treatment is urgently required for a condition in which therapy is primarily supportive.
cEEG is primarily used to detect nonconvulsive seizures, which are frequent and possibly associated with harm. Cerebral ischemia, such as that from vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, can be detected earlier by EEG and quantitative EEG (qEEG). Highly skilled technicians and subspecialty-trained physicians are needed to generate good quality EEG and to interpret these data. qEEG allows more efficient interpretation of large amounts of EEG and may trigger prespecified alarms. Currently, there is little high-quality data on cEEG to define indications, cost-saving potential, and impact on outcome. A few studies have demonstrated how cEEG can be integrated into multimodality brain monitoring of severely brain-injured patients.
Use of microdialysis with other methods, including PET, electrophysiological monitoring and brain tissue oximetry in traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage with vasospasm, and infarction with refractory increased intracranial pressure have been reported. Potentially adverse neurochemical effects of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and cortical slow depolarization waves, both of which are increasingly recognized in traumatic brain injury and stroke patients, have been reported. The explosive growth in the use of cerebral oximetry with targeted management of brain tissue oxygen levels is leading to greater understanding of derangements of cerebral bioenergetics in the critically ill brain, but there remain unresolved basic issues. Understanding of the analytes that are measurable at the bedside - glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate and glycerol - continues to evolve with glucose, lactate, pyruvate and the lactate-pyruvate ratio taking center stage. Analytes including inflammatory biomarkers such as cytokines and metabolites of nitric oxide are presently investigational, but hold promise for future application in advancing our understanding of basic pathophysiology, therapeutic target selection and prognostication. Growing consensus on indications for use of clinical microdialysis and advances in commercially available equipment continue to make microdialysis increasingly 'ready for prime time.'
The International Liaison Committee On Resuscitation has recently given new direction to the care of patients after cardiac arrest by addressing the variety of medical problems encountered after resuscitation as a single postcardiac arrest syndrome. This paradigm centers on supportive care to optimize neurological outcomes and especially focuses on therapeutic hypothermia.
In 2007, results from a pooled analysis of three European trials as well as data from two of these trials were published and yield compelling evidence for the benefit of hemicraniectomy.
The use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is common in critical care medicine and is a major challenge to physicians in the ICU. The mechanism of stress ulcer is believed to be multifactorial, yet remains incompletely understood. The most widely used drugs for stress ulcer prophylaxis are intravenous histamine2-receptor antagonists. They raise gastric pH, but are associated with the development of tolerance, possible drug interactions, and neurologic manifestations. Sucralfate, which can be administered by the nasogastric route, can protect the gastric mucosa without raising pH, but may decrease absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Proton pump inhibitors are the most potent acid-inhibiting pharmacologic agents available. Proton pump inhibitors are at least as effective as histamine2-receptor antagonists, as a limited number of clinical trials have demonstrated. However, these trials were small, lacked an active comparator, varied in the number of risk factors, and used a different definition of clinically important bleeding than previously established.
CDI is the focus of intense and comprehensive research. For the critical care practitioner, relevant knowledge includes diagnosis of CDI, defining the severity of disease, the role of proton pump inhibitors, and treatment options for refractory or relapsing disease.
The important topics of fluid disturbances, role of the liver biopsy, administration of N-acetylcysteine, role of hypothermic therapy and management of intracranial hypertension, coagulopathy and infection are discussed. Finally, the evaluation, management and recent outcomes of liver transplantation candidates are described.
After 60s exposure time, VHNs with indirect FRC were not different from control VHNs, while VHNs with indirect resin composite were significantly lower (p&lt;0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that resin composite basing material used had the greatest effect on top and bottom VHNs (p&lt;0.001). The presence of an indirect restoration resulted in decreased VHNs (p&lt;0.001), with resin composite resulting in lower VHNs when compared to FRC. Moreover, a longer exposure time resulted in increased VHNs (p&lt;0.001).
The lithium disilicate glass ceramic showed the highest values for Ra; the lowest values were found for the glass ceramic, the partially sintered zirconia and the hipped zirconia ceramic. Protein coating caused a significant increase in gamma(t) and gamma(p), but not in the control material. The control material showed higher values for streptococcal adhesion than all ceramic materials. After protein coating, only slight and random differences in streptococcal adhesion were found between the various ceramic materials.
Hardness values were in the range 30.2 (+/-0.5)-62.9 (+/-0.8) with the corresponding calculated modulus values in the range 1.1-4.1MPa and 0.9-4.3MPa for the Gent and modified equations, respectively. Young's modulus values derived from the tensile data were in the range 0.8 (+/-0.3)-4.1 (+/-0.3)MPa, showing good agreement with those calculated from the hardness values. Providing viscoelastic creep is minimal during the duration of the test, there is a reasonably well-defined relationship between Shore hardness and Young's modulus in the hardness range studied.
Higher elemental release (mean+/-S.D.) of all elements from all materials was evident into the lactic acid solution except for Ag. In the gold alloy, there was significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between Zn and other released elements in the NaCl solution, and it also revealed significant difference between Pd or Ag and Cu which detection value was more than Zn (but no statistical difference) into lactic acid solution. The Ni was significantly more released from Ni-Cr alloy than the other elements into both NaCl and lactic acid solutions. The same was observed for Fe released from St-St alloy. There was more significant release of K than Al from CAD-CAM ceramic in only NaCl solution.
The bond strength to enamel was not influenced by the amount of photo-initiator, whereas the bond strength to dentin dropped significantly when concentrations below 0.35wt% camphorquinone were used. Besides phase-separation droplets, electron microscopy revealed the presence of many small droplets at the bottom of the adhesive layer when the adhesive contained no or only a low concentration of initiator, or when the adhesive was not light-cured.
There was a significant drop in MTBS values after 90 days of water storage for all tested zirconia primers from ca. 28-41MPa to ca. 15-18MPa after completion of artificial aging. SEM revealed increase in percentage of interfacial failure after water storage. FTIR spectra suggested adequate activation of the experimental zirconia primers within 1h of mixing time.
All the failure loads of air-stored specimens were higher than those of AS-stored specimens. The failure load was relatively stable for air-stored specimens but showed a significant decreasing tendency for AS-stored specimens.
There was an optimal CQ and EDMAB concentration that resulted in maximum DC and KHN, beyond which increased concentration resulted in a decline in those properties. KHN testing identified two regions of maxima with best overlaps occurring at CQ:EDMAB ratio of 1.44:0.42 and 1.05:1.65mol%. DC evaluation showed one region of maximum, the best overlap occurring at CQ:EDMAB ratio of 2.40:0.83mol%. DoC was 4mm. Overall, maximum CS was attained before the system reached the maximum possible conversion and hardness.
A multilayer TiO(2) nano-network was produced rapidly on Ti surface using a simple electrochemical anodization treatment. The TiO(2) nano-network layer on the anodized Ti surfaces significantly improved in vitro and in vivo hMSC growth, as assessed by measurement of GFP fluorescence, relative to hMSC growth on untreated Ti surface. The TiO(2) nano-network layer on the anodized Ti surfaces can also induce the differentiation of hMSCs after 28-day in vivo test.
The need to improve shrinkage properties and wear resistance is obvious for dental composites, and a vast number of attempts have been made to accomplish these aims. Future resin-based materials may be further improved in this respect if, for example nanotechnology is applied. Dental composites may, however, reach a completely new quality by utilizing new trends from materials science, such as introducing nanostructures, antimicrobial properties, stimuli responsive capabilities, the ability to promote tissue regeneration or repair of dental tissues if the composites were able to repair themselves.
The drop-out rate was 3% after 4 years. After 48 months of clinical service, 21 restorations in 16 patients (9 luted with Definite, 12 with Variolink; 2 placed by operator A and 19 by operator B) had to be replaced due to inlay fracture (n=11), tooth fracture (n=4), hypersensitivities (n=3), or marginal gap formation (n=3). Seventy-seven inlays were in good condition (survival rate 89.9%, median survival time 4.2 years (95% confidence interval +/-0.25; survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier algorithm). Survival rate after 4 years was 97.4% for operator A, and 75.4% for operator B (p=0.002; Log Rank/Mantel-Cox) resulting in annual failure rates of 0.6% and 6.2%, respectively. The operators did not differently judge the clinical behaviour of the luting procedures (Mann-Whitney U-test, p&gt;0.05). Independent of the operator and the used luting system, the following criteria significantly changed over time: color match, marginal integrity, tooth integrity, inlay integrity, sensitivity, hypersensitivity, and X-ray control (p&lt;0.05; Friedman test). Significant differences between operators over the whole period were computed for the criteria marginal integrity, tooth integrity, and inlay integrity (p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Differences between luting materials were only present during single recalls.
In all samples a decomposition of comonomers by the use of PLE was observed. Due to the high rate constant k of MMA (e.g. k(MMA)&gt;1.3mg/(ls)) epoxidation of non-cleaved molecules of this substance can be excluded. Compared to MMA the decomposition of TEGDMA and HEMA is significantly slower (e.g. k((TEGDMA, PLE=7units/ml))=0.004mg/(ls) and k((HEMA, PLE=7units/ml))=0.00013mg/(ls)). Thus in case of a low liver enzyme concentration the epoxidation of non-cleaved molecules of TEGDMA and HEMA cannot be excluded.
DeltaOP and DeltaOP/OP(D65) values were influenced by the two factors within each restorative material based on two-way ANOVA. High opalescent materials showed higher DeltaOP values. OP(D65) was lower than OP(F2) and OP(A) values. Restorative materials showed lower DeltaOP/OP(D65) values than bovine enamel. Correlation coefficients between OP values relative to different illuminants were higher than 0.961 (P&lt;0.01).
The presence of ethanol in the demineralized dentin increased adhesive collagen encapsulation as indicated by trichrome staining. The SEM results confirmed that the ethanol wet bonding improved the quality of the interface. Micro-Raman spectral analysis of the dentin/adhesive interface indicated there was a gradual decrease in penetration of BisGMA component for specimens using water wet bonding, while relatively homogeneous distribution of the hydrophobic BisGMA component was noted in the interface with ethanol wet bonding.
The high level (3%) photoinitiated groups exhibited greater DC than the low level (1%) groups. In the 3% group, the COA group showed the fastest and the highest DC, while in the 1% group the CA and COA groups showed the greatest DC.In the color stability test, both CA groups were darker and more yellow than the CO and COA groups. Color was more stable in composite resins containing OPPI than those containing only the CQ and amine components. The least color change (greatest color stability) was found using 25 degrees C saline solution aging, and the most change (least color stability) occurred using 60 degrees C dry air aging.
Energy density, power density, and mode of cure of the polymer influenced the softening and elution of monomers in ethanol. As energy density increased, softening and elution in ethanol decreased. At same energy density, the influence of power density varied with the mode of cure. When compared to the continuous mode of cure, and at same energy density, pulse-delay irradiation resulted in polymers that in general were more susceptible to softening, but eluted monomers to a lower extent. Less elution was also found with step-cured polymers. Significant, negative correlations were detected between softening and elution in ethanol, respectively, and degree of conversion and between softening and elution in ethanol, respectively, and glass transition temperature.
The results showed that the decontamination regimen and clinical use had no statistically significant effect on the nickel titanium archwires, but did have a statistically significant effect on the steel archwires. Decontamination of the steel wires significantly increased the observed surface hardness (p=0.01) and reduced the surface roughness (p=0.02). Clinical use demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the observed elastic modulus (p&lt;0.001) and a decrease in surface roughness (p=0.001).
DC by self-curing was less than the DC by dual-curing, for all cements. Shrinkage-strain ranged from 1.77 to 5.29% and shrinkage-stress from 3.36 to 10.37MPa. NX2 and VL2 were not significantly different, when light-cured only. Except for RX, sc and dc shrinkage-strain varied maximally by 0.4%. MX showed the highest S(Y), RX the lowest. When sc, RX initially expanded by &lt;0.5% (t approximately 5min). For most materials, S(Y) correlated with their filler loading. The highest stress with sc was exerted by MX, and when dc by MS, which was not statistically different from MX.
Glucose caused increased FN mRNA and protein expression in HUVECs and cardiomyocytes hypertrophy along with upregulation of ET-1 mRNA, leptin mRNA and protein. Glucosemimetic effects were seen with leptin and ET-1. Leptin receptor antagonist (leptin quadruple mutant) and dual endothelin A endothelin B (ETA/ETB) receptor blocker bosentan normalized such abnormalities. Hearts from the diabetic animals showed hypertrophy and similar mRNA changes.
After 4 weeks of dose titration, the levels of FPG were reduced in the two groups compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). During the next 4 weeks' treatment, the levels of FPG were stable, but the serum concentration of hsCRP and IL-6 was markedly reduced in the insulin-treated group compared with that in the metformin-treated group (p &lt; 0.001).
Serum fetuin-A and phosphofetuin-A concentrations were decreased following niacin administration (p &lt; 0.005). Changes in fetuin-A concentrations were correlated with changes in triglyceride (r = 0.62, p = 0.01) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations (r = 0.58, p &lt; 0.05) after niacin treatment. Changes in high-density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol following niacin intervention were negatively correlated with changes in serum fetuin-A (p &lt; 0.05) and phosphofetuin-A concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). Serum cortisol levels were significantly elevated after niacin administration.
AGEs activated in a dose-dependent manner the expression of RAGE and inhibited PPAR-gamma expression in endothelial cells as testified by both reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Stimulation of cultured endothelial cells with AGEs significantly enhanced intracellular ROS formation in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, neutrophil-endothelial adhesion was significantly increased after incubation of control veins with AGEs.
In comparison with nestin positive ES cells developed according to the reference protocol, the number of ES cells differentiated with the four-stage protocol increased under in vivo conditions upon morphological analysis. The cells exhibited, in comparison to the in vitro situation, increased gene and protein expression of Pdx1, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), the GLUT2 glucose transporter and glucokinase, which are functional markers for glucose-induced insulin secretion of pancreatic beta cells. Renal sub-capsular implantation of ES cells with a higher degree of differentiation achieved by in vitro differentiation with a four-stage protocol enabled further significant maturation for the beta-cell-specific markers, insulin and the co-stored IAPP as well as the glucose recognition structures. In contrast, further in vivo differentiation was not achieved with cells differentiated in vitro by the reference protocol.
PP progressively increased (p &lt; 0.0001) and PP/MBP decreased (p &lt; 0.0005) according to T1DM duration, whereas these parameters remained almost unchanged in age-matched control subjects. E/I ratio (p &lt; 0.0001) and baroreflex gain (p &lt; 0.0005) progressively decreased with T1DM duration. The parasympathetic index (squatting test vagal ratio-SqTv) significantly increased (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas the sympathetic index (squatting test sympathetic ratio-SqTs) only tended to decrease (p = 0.12) according to diabetes duration. No such changes in CAN indices were observed in the non-diabetic population.
Both FCP and PCP levels stayed steady in the insulin plus 1-alpha(OH)D3 group, while FCP decreased in insulin-alone group (P = 0.006) during the 12-month intervention. Seventy percent of patients treated with 1-alpha(OH)D3 maintained or increased their FCP concentrations after 1 year of treatment, while only 22% of patients treated with insulin alone maintained stable FCP levels (P &lt; 0.01). Further analysis on LADA subgroups with different durations of diabetes demonstrated that islet beta-cell function was better preserved (as reflected by significantly higher FCP and PCP levels) in the 1-alpha(OH)D3 plus insulin group only in patients with diabetes duration no longer than 1 year. No severe side effects were observed in any group.
HG augmented ROS and lipoperoxide production, decreasing glutathione (GSH) levels and increasing antioxidant enzymes and HO-1 expression. Basal progesterone production was reduced, while a higher response to ACTH was observed in HG-treated cells. The increase in HO-1 expression and the effects on basal steroid production were abolished by antioxidant treatment. Inhibition of HO activity increased basal and ACTH-stimulated steroid release. Similar results were obtained by HO-1 gene silencing while the opposite effect was observed in Y1 cells overexpressing HO-1.
Two different, adequately evaluated testing systems, involving the detection of anti-CCP antibodies and of anti-MCV antibodies, are now commercially available and enable routine, relatively highly specific diagnostic testing for RA. Two point-of-care tests (POCT) for the early diagnosis of RA constitute the latest development in serologic diagnostic testing.
Sleep-disordered breathing was documented in 74% of all patients with AFib (43% had OSA and 31% had CSA/CSR). Patients with CSA/CSR had a higher PAP, a higher apnea-hypopnea index, a greater LAD, and a lower capillary blood pCO(2) than patients with OSA.
BPA levels had an inter-quartile range from 1.1 to 3.1 ng/mg creatinine, slightly higher than levels in specimens from NHANES collected 3-11 years later. The Spearman correlation was approximately 0.5 for samples 2 weeks apart and 0.3 for samples 4 weeks apart. Menstrual cycle phase did not influence levels. BPA tended to increase during the three-year collection period, but not significantly.
Der p 1 house dust mite allergen concentration of 2.0 microg/g or more from the main room and the child's bed was related to increased asthma severity independent of allergic status (respectively, OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.37, 6.30 for 2.0-10.0 microg/g and OR 2.55 95% CI 1.13, 5.73 for 10.0 microg/g). Higher pet allergen levels were associated with greater asthma severity, but only for those sensitized (cat OR 2.41 95% CI 1.19, 4.89; dog OR 2.06 95% CI 1.01, 4.22).
Mean weekly exposure to all RF-EMF sources was 0.13 mW/m(2) (0.22 V/m) (range of individual means 0.014-0.881 mW/m(2)). Exposure was mainly due to mobile phone base stations (32.0%), mobile phone handsets (29.1%) and digital enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT) phones (22.7%). Persons owning a DECT phone (total mean 0.15 mW/m(2)) or mobile phone (0.14 mW/m(2)) were exposed more than those not owning a DECT or mobile phone (0.10 mW/m(2)). Mean values were highest in trains (1.16 mW/m(2)), airports (0.74 mW/m(2)) and tramways or buses (0.36 mW/m(2)), and higher during daytime (0.16 mW/m(2)) than nighttime (0.08 mW/m(2)). The Spearman correlation coefficient between mean exposure in the first and second week was 0.61.
For all metals (except Ni) urinary concentrations were significantly higher in subjects from the mining area than in control subjects. In subjects living very close to mines or smelting plants, the geometric means (25th-75th percentile) of urinary concentrations, expressed as microg/g creatinine, were 17.8 (10.9-29.0) for As, 0.75 (0.38-1.16) for Cd, 15.7 (5.27-43.2) for Co, 17.1 (8.44-43.2) for Cu, 3.17 (1.47-5.49) for Pb and 0.028 (0.013-0.065) for U, these values being significantly higher than those of subjects living 3-10 km from mines or industrial operations. Urinary Co concentrations were markedly elevated, exceeding 15 microg/g creatinine in 53% of the subjects, and even 87% of children (&lt;14 yr), living very close to the mining areas. Urinary As was also high (79% above 10 microg/g creatinine in subjects living very close to the mining areas). Compared with background values from the US general population, subjects living very close to areas of mining or refining had 4-, 43-, 5- and 4-fold higher urinary concentrations of Cd, Co, Pb and U, respectively.
Lead and mercury levels in urine, blood, and hair indicated low exposures. VDR polymorphism and joint presence of VDR/ALAD polymorphisms were significantly and independently associated with urine lead concentrations (CATREG P&lt;0.05). Polymorphisms in GSTP1-114 and MT4 genes as well as dual gene combinations including GSTP1, GCLC, GSTT1, and GSTM1 polymorphisms were independent variables related to mercury body burdens (CATREG P&lt;0.05). GSTP1-114/GSTT1 and GSTP1-105/GCLC combinations showed synergistic effects on hair mercury levels compared to single-gene variants.
Concentrations calculated with the ExTra index and the reference method were similar. The ExTra index underestimated exposure by 2.2 microg m(-3) on average compared to the reference method. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.85 and its 95% confidence interval was [0.62; 0.95].

Twenty-nine patients (56 +/- 12 years) with a history of recent acute coronary events (ACE) underwent STE-DSE. Left ventricular images, sampled at frame rates 70-100 Hz, were analysed off-line (Echopac BT 6.0.0). Velocity, strain, and rotational imaging were performed. Twenty patients had LV ejection fraction (EF) &gt;40% (Group 1) whereas nine patients had LVEF &lt;40% (Group 2). Average heart and frame rates were identical during DSE in the two groups (P = ns). Global circumferential strain (%) was significantly lower in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (10.65 +/- 5.30 vs. 16.82 +/- 6.61; P &lt; 0.05) at rest and during peak stress (14.72 +/- 6.51 vs. 21.13 +/- 7.2; P &lt; 0.05). The global peak rotation rate (degree/s) was, however, higher at rest in Group 2 (70 +/- 97 vs. 19 +/- 67; P &lt; 0.05) and 20 microg stress. Peak systolic velocity increased in three of the four LV walls at 20 microg (in Groups 1 and 2). A global rotational rate increased significantly at 20 microg during systole in both the groups, but was unchanged in Group 2 during diastole.
Transthoracic and transoesophageal data from patients with a variety of cardiac conditions were used for analysis of LV regional function. The focus was on the effects of mechanical asynchrony. Ejection fraction was calculated on the basis of LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume obtained by two different ways: (i) end-systolic volume as a whole; and (ii) the sum of all regional end-systolic volumes (which may occur at different times). The relative difference, D-EF, between EFs obtained by (i) and (ii) was taken as the 'merit' of EF. A value of zero is the highest merit. Irrespective of the examination method, we found that D-EF was always higher than zero, and that its value depended on the extent of mechanical asynchrony.
We performed aortic arch analysis on all 2000 adult patients (mean age 52, range 18-89) referred to our echocardiography lab for transthoracic echocardiograms between January and December 2007. Adequate study was obtained in 1826 patients (91% of cases). Suprasternal notch views and aortic arch analysis were normal in 1787 patients (98%) and abnormal in 39 patients (2%). Among patients with abnormal findings, 32 patients (82%) had aortic arch plaques, 24 of them (75%) had plaques &lt;4 mm, and 8 patients (25%) had plaques &gt; or =4 mm. Four patients (10%) had aortic arch aneurysms (diameter &gt; or =4.5 cm). Other abnormal findings included one case of coarctation of the aorta, one case of a floating thrombus in a right pulmonary artery branch, one case of severe stenosis of the inominate artery, and one case of type A aortic dissection. Subsequently, 7 patients (18%) underwent surgery, 4 patients (10%) were started on oral anticoagulation therapy, and 28 patients (72%) treated with an antiplatelet and risk factors modification.
Forty patients were studied by transthoracic 2D and 3D echocardiography pre- and 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. TAPSE (15.5 +/- 3, 16.5 +/- 3, and 18.5 +/- 4 mm at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively) and PSV (11.9 +/- 2, 12 +/- 2, and 12.8 +/- 3 cm/s at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively) were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) lower after surgery in comparison with pre-surgical values (TAPSE: 25.3 +/- 4 mm; PSV: 17.8 +/- 4 cm/s). On the contrary, pre-operative RVEF (58.4 +/- 4%) did not change after surgery (56.9 +/- 5, 59.5 +/- 5, and 58.5 +/- 5% at each step).
Twenty-five patients underwent 2DE and RT3DE. Views of 2DE (RV inflow, RV short axis, and apical four-chamber) were compared with RT3DE views by four readers. RT3DE data sets were sliced from anterior-posterior (apical view) and from base to apex (short axis) to obtain six standardized planes. Readers recorded the RV ejection fraction (RVEF) from 2DE and RT3DE images. RVEF recorded by RT3DE (RVEF(3D)) and 2D (RVEF(2D)) were compared with RVEF by disc summation (RVEF(DS)), which was used as a reference. Interobserver variability among readers of RVEF(3D) and RVEF(2D) was then compared. Overall, mean RVEF(DS), RVEF(3D), and RVEF(2D) were 37 +/- 11%, 38 +/- 10%, 41 +/- 10%, respectively. The mean difference of RVEF(3D)-RVEF(DS) was significantly less than RVEF(2D)-RVEF(DS) (3.7 +/- 4% vs. 7.1 +/- 5%, P = 0.0066, F-test). RVEF(3D) correlated better with RVEF(DS) (r = 0.875 vs. r = 0.69, P = 0.028, t-test). RVEF(3D) was associated with a 39% decrease in interobserver variability when compared with RVEF(2D) [standard deviation of mean difference: 3.7 vs. 5.1, (RT3DE vs. 2DE), P = 0.018, t-test].
Retrospective longitudinal cohort of children (n = 88) after repair of TOF followed by serial echocardiography over 9 years. LV and RV diameters were expressed by z-scores based on normal paediatric reference values. Time courses of LV and RV diameter z-scores, degree of PR, and influence of co-variables were analysed using mixed regression models. LV diameter z-scores were significantly lowered before repair, increased after surgery, but fell again over time; thus, mean LV diameters were significantly lower than normal population means at all times. LV diameter z-scores correlated negatively with RV dilation and degree of PR. Notably, they were significantly higher in patients with previous shunts. After pulmonary valve replacement, LV diameter z-scores recovered to normal, whereas RV diameter z-scores remained abnormal.
One hundred and sixty type 2 diabetic patients and 110 non-diabetic controls, all with no evidence of heart disease, were studied. The participants were stratified into four distinct age-groups (A: &lt;46, B: 46-60, C: 61-75, and D: &gt;75 years) and underwent full echocardiographic examination. Conventional systolic and diastolic parameters were similar between the study groups. However, tissue Doppler imaging examination revealed an impaired systolic and diastolic longitudinal myocardial function in diabetic patients vs. controls, although these differences were not noticed within the youngest age-group. Diastolic dysfunction was established concomitantly in both diabetic and control subjects in age-group B. In contrast, diabetic patients showed an earlier induction of myocardial systolic dysfunction, evidenced by significantly lower average systolic longitudinal myocardial velocity in age-group B. Independent predictors of systolic myocardial dysfunction were age, glycated haemoglobin, and systemic blood pressure.
Seventy healthy volunteers, with a good continuous wave Doppler tricuspid regurgitation signal at rest, underwent quantitative Doppler echocardiographic measurements at rest and during semi-supine exercise test. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was estimated at rest, at low level (25 W), and at peak exercise using four times tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity squared adding a right atrial pressure of 5 mmHg. During exercise, PASP increased from rest (27 +/- 4 mmHg) to peak (51 +/- 9 mmHg). None of the individuals reached a PASP &gt; or = 60 mmHg at 25 W. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure at peak was higher in individuals &gt; or =60 years old compared with those from 20 to 59 years old (56 +/- 9 vs. 49 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0.02). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure at peak exercise &gt; or =60 mmHg was found in 36% of the individuals aged from 60 to 70 and in 50% after 70. Age, LV mass, and PASP at rest were independent predictors of PASP at peak exercise.
Fifty-one consecutive patients with heart failure underwent exercise Doppler echocardiography before CRT implantation to assess global contractile reserve and local contractile reserve (assessed by two-dimensional speckle tracking) in the region of the LV pacing lead. Responders (30 patients) showed a greater exercise-induced increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with non-responders (P &lt; 0.001). Contractile reserve was directly related to the improvement in LVEF and to LV reverse remodelling after 6 months of CRT (P &lt; 0.001). A 6.5% exercise-induced increase in LVEF yielded a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 85.7% to predict the response after 6 months of CRT. Baseline myocardial deformation as well as contractile reserve in the LV pacing lead region was greater in responders than in non-responders (P &lt; 0.0001).
Echo imaging and invasive LV pressure measurements were performed during right atrial (RA) pacing and dobutamine challenge in eight pigs. LV torsion and torsional rate profiles were analysed from grey scale and tissue Doppler data (apical and basal short axis) at frame rates of 82 +/- 17 and 183 +/- 14 Hz, respectively. Temporal subsampling of TDI data sets was performed at 82 +/- 6 Hz in order to mimic the mean temporal resolution of STI and the LV torsional curves were again extracted. At rest, LV UR values were comparable for both imaging techniques. However, during dobutamine stimulation, TDI estimated peak UR was predominantly higher than UR measured by STI (-112.1 +/- 64.5 degrees /s vs. -75.5 +/- 31.4 degrees /s, P &lt; 0.05). The similarity of LV UR measurements with respect to the STI/TDI data was examined by a Bland-Altman analysis.
2D speckle tracking and TDI echocardiograms were performed in 79 healthy adult male volunteers (age range: 22-76 years). 2D speckle tracking allowed the determination of myocardial epsilon and peak systolic and early diastolic SR in radial, circumferential, and longitudinal planes, whereas TDI provided longitudinal epsilon only. Mean circumferential and radial epsilon and SR were calculated from data collected at six basal myocardial regions, whereas mean longitudinal epsilon and SR derived from both 2D speckle tracking and TDI were calculated from the basal septum and basal lateral walls. Standard 2D echocardiography allowed the assessment of LV morphology including LV length, LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-diastolic diameter, mean wall thickness, and LV mass. The association of myocardial epsilon and SR data with relevant LV morphology indices was determined by adoption of the general, non-linear allometric model (y= ax(b)). The b exponent +/- 95% confidence intervals were reported. The relationships between the measures of LV morphology and myocardial epsilon and SR were highly variable and generally weak. Only two relationships displayed at least a moderate effect size (r &gt; or = 0.30): (i) 2D circumferential peak systolic SR and LV end-diastolic dimension (b = -0.92; -1.35 to 0.5, r = 0.44) and (ii) TDI longitudinal peak systolic SR and LV length (b = -1.39; -2.11 to -0.66, r = 0.41).
We evaluated 70 individuals, consisting of 35 hypertensives and 35 middle-aged volunteers as a control. None had DD based on global indices (deceleration time, isovolumic relaxation time, and E/A). Segmental early and late diastolic Doppler-derived strain rates (SRs) were recorded from 18 segments in the longitudinal axis. The number of segments with SR(E)/SR(A)&lt;1.1 was represented as segmental DD. Mean relaxation of the basal, mid, and apical regions was also calculated. Septal and mean mitral annular Ea velocities were also recorded. Non-hypertensive, middle-aged individuals had evidence of segmental DD that was mostly distributed at the basal parts of the heart, and in particular at the septal wall. Hypertensive patients had a lower mean relaxation based on SR(E) and SR(E/A) at the basal, mid, and apical regions, with the basal parts appearing more compromised and with higher segmental DD compared with controls. Segmental DD in that group was more extensive towards the mid and even apical regions, with the septal and basal inferior walls being the most heavily affected areas. The lateral wall appeared to be the region that was most resistant to diastolic abnormalities in both groups. Even individuals with 'normal' septal and mean Ea had evidence of segmental DD. However, contrary to global indices of DD, septal Ea could predict the presence of segmental DD.
The study population consisted of 40 non-selected patients (mean age 48 +/- 18 year, 20 men) and 50 non-selected healthy volunteers (mean age 34 +/- 12 year, 21 men). Feasibility and intra-observer reproducibility of the measurement of LV rotation parameters by STE were assessed for two different methods (Method A: six tracking points placed mid-myocardial and Method B: six tracking points placed endocardial and epicardial forming six myocardial segments). Subsequently, inter-observer and temporal reproducibility of the most robust method were assessed. Complete LV rotation assessment was more feasible with Method A (60 out of 90 subjects, 67% vs. 50 out of 90 subjects, 56%). In the 49 subjects in whom both Methods A and B were feasible, intra-observer reproducibility of LV rotation parameters was better with Method A (variabilities 2 +/- 3 to 10 +/- 9% vs. 2 +/- 4 to 21 +/- 18%). With this method, inter-observer variability varied from 4 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 9% and temporal variability from 4 +/- 6 to 19 +/- 15%.
We evaluated whether peak systolic longitudinal strain (PSLS) of left ventricle using 2D speckle tracking method might be useful for screening of severe CAD. One hundred and eight patients who underwent echocardiography and coronary angiography were evaluated. Patients were grouped according to the coronary angiographic findings as follows; high-risk group with left main or three-vessel CAD (n = 38), low-risk group with one- or two-vessel CAD (n = 28), and control group without CAD (n = 30). PSLSs of all left ventricular segments were obtained successfully in 96 (89%) patients. None had RWMA at resting echocardiogram. PSLS was significantly reduced, especially in mid- and basal segments, in the high-risk group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that mid- and basal PSLSs could effectively detect patients with severe CAD (area under ROC curve = 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91). According to ROC curve analysis, -17.9% appears to be a helpful cutoff value for discriminating those with severe CAD (specificity 79% and sensitivity 79%).
Sixteen patients aged 25.6 +/- 3.7 years (eight each after Senning or Mustard repair of complete transposition) were studied. Transoesophageal imaging was performed in the catheterization laboratory under general anaesthesia before and at the end of a 10 min infusion of 5 microg/kg/min of Dobutamine. The BNP levels were measured at rest. Myocardial Doppler data were acquired before and at peak stress in a four-chamber view. The BNP (pg/mL) values of 67.3 +/- 47.5 (14-189) were elevated. There was no correlation between BNP and IVA, strain, or systolic and diastolic velocities at rest. Dobutamine stress led to a significant increase in IVA, s-velocity, and strain but no significant change in e-velocity. A correlation was found between increase in IVA under Dobutamine and BNP levels (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.02).
A total of 150 patients with presumed aneurysmatic peripheral atherosclerotic disease were included in the study. Patients were first scanned with conventional ultrasound (US), serving as reference technique. An infra-renal abdominal aorta diameter of &gt; or =30 mm was defined as an AAA. Hereafter, the aorta was scanned using the Aortascan BVI 9600. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 statistical software. Abdominal aortic aneurysms were detected with conventional US in 78 (52%) patients, compared with 74 (49%) AAA's detected with Aortascan BVI 9600. The Aortascan BVI 9600 demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 90, 94, 95, and 89%, respectively, in the detection of AAA's.
To assess the reliability of Syntax scoring, 100 diagnostic angiograms from the Syntax trial were randomly selected and assessed independently by two observers. Intra-observer variability was assessed by analysing 91 sets of angiograms after an interval of at least eight weeks by one of the observers. Clinical outcomes in the randomised cohort of the Syntax trial up to one year are presented with stratification by tertile group of the SYNTAX score. The weighted kappa value for the inter-observer reproducibility on the global score was 0.45, while the intra-observer weighted kappa value was 0.59. The SYNTAX score as calculated by investigators consistently underscored the corelab score by 3.4 points. When the Syntax randomised cohort was stratified by tertiles of the SYNTAX score, there were similar or non-significantly different MACCE rates in those with low or intermediate scores; however in the top tertile the MACCE rate was greater in those receiving PCI compared to CABG.
We assessed the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE=death, acute myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularisation, TVR) and angiographic stent thrombosis (ST) during 3-year follow-up in a prospective multicentre registry. Propensity-score analysis to adjust for different clinical, angiographic and procedural characteristics was performed. Overall, 14,115 patients enrolled in the registry received solely BMS (n=9,565) or DES (n=4,550). The incidence of definite ST was 0.6% for BMS and 1.3% for DES (p=0.003). The propensity-score adjusted incidence of cardiac death and myocardial infarction was similar between the two groups (DES 11.9% vs. BMS 12.1%, HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77-1.04), whereas DES were associated with lower rates of TVR (DES 11.6% vs. BMS 15.2%, HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59-0.76). The efficacy of DES in reducing TVR increased with increasing likelihood of TVR at baseline.
No specific inclusion/exclusion criteria were mandated; patients enrolled at procedure initiation. Two-year follow-up was 94%, with independent adjudication of major cardiac events, monitoring of patients with cardiac events and an additional 10-20% sample by site. Most ARRIVE cases (64%, n=4,794) typified expanded use based on patient/lesion characteristics outside the simple use (single vessel/stent) pivotal trial populations. These expanded use patients had higher 2-year rates than simple use patients for mortality (7.8% vs. 4.2%, P&lt;0.001), myocardial infarction (MI, 3.9% vs. 2.2%, P&lt;0.001), target lesion revascularisation (TLR, 9.2% vs. 5.4%, P&lt;0.001), and stent thrombosis (3.3% vs. 1.4%, P&lt;0.001). Among subgroups with renal disease, chronic total occlusion (CTO), lesion &gt;28 mm, reference vessel diameter (RVD) &lt;2.5 mm, multivessel stenting, acute MI, bifurcation, vein graft, or in-stent restenosis, TLR ranged from 3.8% to 8.9% in year one, and from 1.3% to 6.0% during year two.
In our early experience, 21 patients underwent CoreValve implantation between 12/2005 and 02/2007. Among the 11 deaths at one year follow-up, four patients had an autopsy with macro and microscopic analysis. The device was divided in three parts during pathological assessment: the lower portion (area 1), the leaflets (area 2) and the upper part (area 3). The CoreValves were implanted for 3, 13, 104 and 350 days. Gross examination showed neointimal tissue covering most of the frame struts in contact with the aortic wall, but areas of high velocity blood flow were bare. Histopathology examination demonstrated fibrin deposition and inflammatory response early after valve implantation, followed by neointimal coverage with progressive regression of the inflammatory response over time.
We describe a novel percutaneous approach to double orifice mitral repair utilising an intra-cardiac suture based system. The procedure was performed in 15 patients in four international centres. Endovascular suture based double orifice mitral repair was feasible with an acute reduction in the severity of MR by &gt; or = 1 grade in nine of 15 patients. At 30 days improvement in MR appeared durable in six patients. Clinical utility was limited by technical difficulties, the inadequacies of current imaging modalities and suture dehiscence.
Consecutive patients from six centres who had OCT examination were retrospectively included. All adverse events and complications, even if transient, were noted. Risks were categorised into: 1) self-limiting 2) major complications including major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and 3) mechanical device failure. A total of 468 patients underwent OCT examination for evaluation of: plaque (40.0%), percutaneous coronary intervention (28.2%) or follow-up stent tissue coverage (31.8%). OCT was performed using a non-occlusive flush technique in 45.3% with a mean contrast volume of 36.6+/-9.4ml. Transient chest pain and QRS widening/ST-depression/elevation were observed in 47.6% and 45.5% respectively. Major complications included five (1.1%) cases of ventricular fibrillation due to balloon occlusion and/or deep guide catheter intubation, 3 (0.6%) cases of air embolism and one case of vessel dissection (0.2%). There were no cases of coronary spasm or MACE during or within the 24 hour period following OCT examination.
Polymer casts were created using coronary trees from 23 adult cadaver hearts. Seventy-five arterial intersections between main vessels and side-branches were captured using the combination of a microscope (Smartscope MVP100) and computer program (Gage-X metrology software) specifically calibrated for video-based inspection and measurement (34-fold magnification). The intersection between main vessels and side-branches was a multifaceted, curvilinear transition rather than a bisecting angle. The shape of the ostia was typically elliptical rather than circular. Mean diameters were 2.88 mm in proximal main vessels, 2.34 mm in ostia, and 2.00 mm in side-branches (first-level branches). Obtuse proximal (150 degrees) and distal (111 degrees) angles with accentuated side-branch taper create a "barn door" effect with wider curvature at the bottom.
Forty-five patients with 45 non-left-main coronary bifurcation stenoses were treated with drug-eluting stents (DES) using the sleeve technique and prospectively evaluated. Follow-up angiography was performed on 41 patients (91%) at nine months. The mean age of patient was 65 years with predominance of male (73%); FKB was successfully performed in all patients. Post-procedure myocardial infarction was observed in four patients, leading to an in-hospital major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate of 9%. At angiographic follow-up, the late loss in the main vessel and side-branch was 0.18+/-0.26 mm and 0.29+/-0.27 mm, respectively. Binary angiographic restenosis was seen in two patients (4.7%) at main vessel and one patient (2.4%) at side-branch. At 1-year follow-up, there were two non-cardiac deaths and three patients needed revascularisation.
Our study included 515 consecutive patients treated for 540 lesions. We had a 100% follow-up rate at six months. The patients' characteristics are noted as having a 43% rate of diabetics and a 17% renal insufficiency. Indications for angioplasty included patients with either stable or unstable clinical scenarios and 60% of the lesions were of class B2/C. The mean RVD was 2.81 mm and lesions length was 12.6 mm prior to PCI and with angiographic success in 99.8% of treated lesions. The six month clinical outcome data were as follow: MACE rate of 8.7% with 3.5% total mortality, 1.9% cardiac mortality, 1.4% of any MI and TVR rate of 6.4% per treated patient and 6.7% per treated lesion and 0.4% rate of stent thrombosis.
In the ACUITY trial, 13,819 patients with moderate and high-risk ACS were randomised to either heparin (unfractionated or enoxaparin) plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI), bivalirudin plus a GPI, or bivalirudin alone. Per operator choice, femoral access was utilised in 11,989 patients (93.8%) and radial access in 798 patients (6.2%). There was no significant difference in composite ischaemia between the radial and femoral approaches at 30 days (8.1% vs 7.5%, p=0.18) or 1 year (14.7% vs 15.5%, p=0.77), although fewer major bleeding complications occurred with the use of radial access (3.0%vs4.8%, p=0.03). Use of bivalirudin monotherapy was associated with significantly less 30-day major bleeding than heparin plus GPI after femoral access (3.0% vs 5.8%, p&lt;0.0001), but not with radial access (4.2% vs 2.2%, P=0.19). Major or minor organ bleeding was reduced with bivalirudin monotherapy compared to heparin plus GPI to a similar extent with both femoral (4.1% vs 7.4%, P&lt;0.0001) and radial (4.9% vs 7.2%, P=0.26) access.
This study evaluated, by serial quantitative angiography, the natural history of changes that occurred in the dilated segment between early (mean seven months), late (mean 4.5 years) and very late (mean 17 years) follow-up after balloon angioplasty. Of 127 consecutive patients (174 lesions) with successful coronary angioplasty, 125 underwent early, 84 late and 47 very late angiographic follow-up (75% of eligible survivors). The mean lesion diameter stenosis decreased from 36+/-11% at early to 26+/-15% at late follow-up (p&lt;0.0001), and then increased again to 35+/-25% by very late follow-up (p=0.003). Although stenosis severity at early follow-up angiography predicted lesion regression at late follow-up, there was no significant correlation between late and very late follow-up lesion severity.
In patients scheduled for heart catheterisation, minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and diameter-derived percent stenosis (DPS) were obtained for CAS (&gt;50%) using both QCA and the 3D-system. To estimate stenosis length, a non-inflated balloon was inserted into the stenosis and the distance between balloon markers was measured using both methods and then compared to the known distance between the markers. In 61 patients 79 lesions were analysed. MLD measurements showed a good agreement between QCA and 3D with a mean difference of 0.08+/-0.035 mm. Reference diameter was 2.61+/-0.67 for 3D and 2.42+/-0.61 mm for QCA and 54.79+/-9.20% vs. 58.75+/-8.15% for the %-stenosis range, respectively. The mean true balloon length was 12.8 mm+/-3.8 mm. Lengths determined by the 3D system were 13.0+/-4.0 mm and 11.3+/-3.8 mm by QCA, respectively.
Excised saline infused human arteries were imaged using IVUS with RF acquisition. 40% of the vessels were re-imaged with human blood infusion. A database of approximately 12000 image regions-of-interest (ROIs) of histologically established types was used to design a pattern recognition algorithm to predict the tissue type of a given ROI by comparing its RF-spectrum against the database, and also to estimate the confidence of prediction. Ex vivo validation demonstrated accuracies at the highest level of confidence as: 97%, 98%, 95%, and 98% for necrotic, lipidic, fibrotic and calcified regions respectively. Good agreement with histology was shown in an in vivo swine animal model.
Six rabbits were fed a cholesterol-supplemented diet for 12 to 18 months. Thereafter, VH-IVUS imaging of the aorta was performed. After sacrifice, the VH-IVUS images were matched to the corresponding histological cross sections. A total of 260 atherosclerotic plaques were analysed. VH-IVUS had a high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for the detection of non-calcified thin cap fibroatheroma (88%, 96%, 87%, respectively) and calcified thin cap fibroatheroma (95%, 99%, 93%, respectively). These values were respectively 82%, 94%, 85% for non-calcified fibroatheroma and 78%, 98%, 84% for calcified fibroatheroma. The lowest values were obtained for pathological intimal thickening (74%, 92%, 70%, respectively). For all plaque types, VH-IVUS had a kappa-value of 0.79. Linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots showed a strong correlation between VH-IVUS and histology for fibrous tissue, fibrofatty tissue, necrotic calcified tissue and confluent necrotic core.
Taxus Liberté, Endeavor Sprint, Endeavor Resolute and Xience V DES (three samples of each) were explored by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) following expansion at 14 atm in water. Incidence and size of irregularities were measured during thorough quantitative examinations of a 360 SEM images. DES types examined showed a significant difference in the incidence of irregularities (p&lt;0.0001; 6.6+/-4.2/image at 60-fold magnification) with typical patterns specific for each DES. All types showed areas with bare metal-aspects, but incidence, shape, and size differed largely: Sprint showed the largest areas. Cracks were only found in Sprint and Resolute, while wrinkles were seen exclusively in Taxus Liberté and Xience V (p&lt;0.0001). The coating of each DES type showed some inhomogeneity of distribution, but the incidence differed (p&lt;0.0001) and was least in Taxus Liberté, which, on the other hand, was the only DES that showed webbing with large bare-metal exposure.
The activity of the class I ADH isoenzyme was significantly lower in the wall of aortic aneurysm than in healthy aorta. The other tested classes of ADH showed the tendency to lower level of the activity in aneurysm tissue than that in wall of unchanged aorta. The activities of total ADH and ALDH were also not significantly lower in the aneurysms.
The expression patterns of these proteins varied between first trimester pregnancy terminations and molar placentas. Chorionic villi from first trimester pregnancy terminations showed strong expression of BCL-2 and EGF-R protein. In molar chorionic villi, there was a moderate expression of BCL-2 and EGF-R proteins. p53 protein expression was absent in first trimester pregnancy terminations and a partial mole whereas moderate nuclear positivity was found in the complete mole. There was a significant positive correlation between BCL-2 and EGF-R protein expression whereas inverse correlation exists between p53 and BCL-2/EGF-R protein expression.
Cardiac hypertrophy was found in SHR rats at 4 weeks of age and remained up to 24 weeks of age. The signals of alpha-enolase protein were strong and existed extensively in hypertrophic myocardium in SHR, while in the normal myocardium of WKY, the signals were scarcely found and weak. The levels of alpha-enolase mRNA and protein in SHR and WKY hearts during fetal stage and newborn stage were similar, while from 4 weeks of age to 24 weeks of age, accompanied by the cardiac hypertrophy, the levels of alpha-enolase mRNA and protein in left ventricle of SHR were significantly higher than that in WKY.
At the end of the treatment period, the percentage of patients with a reduction of at least two points on the symptom intensity scale was significantly higher with Carbosylane than with a placebo (P=0.043). Compared with placebo, the intensity of three symptoms (abdominal fullness, bloating and the sensation of slow digestion) was significantly decreased after 90 days of Carbosylane (P&lt;0.05). At the end of the post-treatment follow-up, the percentages of patients with moderate or severe global complaints were 6.78% and 21.43% in the Carbosylane and placebo groups, respectively (P&lt;0.03).
In 2002 and 2005, survey response rates were 81.6 and 73.9%, respectively. In terms of diagnosis, compliance with the systematic performance of biopsies increased from 26.5 to 59.9% (p&lt;0.01) and, with follow-up, from 41.0 to 52.0%, respectively (p&lt;0.02). Management of high-grade dysplasia increased from 16.0 to 24.3% (p&lt;0.01). Total compliance (with all criteria) was achieved by 5.0% of hepatogastroenterologists in 2002 and by 10.7% in 2005 (p&lt;0.01).
Esophageal symptoms and reflux esophagitis were found in 108 (59%) and 68 (37%) of patients, respectively. Esophageal motor disorders were present in 148 patients (81%), and were associated with a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter in 114 (62%). The presence of these motor abnormalities was not related to age, gender, skin extension or duration of disease. Esophageal motor disorders were present in almost all patients with esophageal symptoms or esophagitis, and were also found in 48 (64%) of the asymptomatic patients.
LF&lt;or=1 was found in 116 inmates (80.3%), significant LF in 49 (29.3%) and serious LF in 24 (14.5%). An APRI value &gt;or=0.55 or FIB-4 &gt;or=1.0 showed a PPV of 91% and 92%, respectively, for the presence of any grade of LF (&gt;or=1), but both tests had low diagnostic sensitivity: 61.8% and 61.1%, respectively. An APRI value &gt;or=0.86 or FIB-4 &gt;or=1.3 showed a high NPV for serious LF (92.5% and 88.4% respectively).
Of the 615 individuals selected, 558 were included in the study. The mean age was 36.4 years and 62.4% was female. The prevalence of IBS was 19.9%. Logistic regression analysis showed an association with depressive symptoms and female sex independently of age and anxiety symptoms.
During analysis, the core category of confirmation was identified as describing the individual needs of the spouses. The core category theoretically binds together three underlying subcategories: security, rest for mind and body, and inner strength. Confirmation facilitated acceptance and improvement of mental and physical health among spouses.
In terms of the patients, the following themes emerged: a catalyst for change/wake-up call; change of life philosophy; being protected/being invincible; humanistic attitudes. With regard to the spouses, the following themes emerged: active search for benefit/failure to find benefit and improvement of relationship.
Baseline home interviews of 60 patients with HF (43 men, 17 women) and their spouses included assessments of each partner's psychologic distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25) and perceived general health (Short Form-36 Questionnaire), as well as severity of patients' HF symptoms. We repeated the health and HF-symptom assessments in follow-up interviews 6 months later. As hypothesized, the spouse's distress at baseline predicted an unfavorable course of patients' HF symptoms and general health over the next 6 months, independently of the patient's own baseline distress. There were no prospective effects of the patient's distress on the spouse's health, however, suggesting that partner distress had asymmetric health consequences for patients and spouses.
Social support was not related to any other variable. Preoperative depression and low functional status persisted postoperatively. Female patients had greater depression and poorer functional status than male patients both preoperatively and postoperatively. No other gender differences were found.
Patients had a lower HRQoL than significant others in both stages after CABG. The HRQoL of patients and significant others was explained by their HRQoL 1 month after the operation. Other significant explanatory factors among patients were cardiac symptoms on physical exertion and other additional diseases. Among significant others, chronic diseases were associated with HRQoL.
The coronary care unit teams rarely provided oral or written information about sexual function and coexistence to patients with MI or their partners. The health care professionals lacked competence in these areas.
Data were collected on 40 subjects generating 209 paired readings. Moderate positive correlation between BIS and SAS values was shown with a Spearman Rank coefficient r value of .502 and an r(2) of .252 (P &lt; .0001). Wide ranges of BIS scores were observed, especially in very sedated patients. Strong positive correlation was noted between BIS and electromyography with an r value of .749 (P &lt; .0001). Age and gender significantly influenced BIS/SAS correlations.
Across 11 maintenance treatment studies, the relapse rate was significantly different at 1 year for active drug (23%) versus placebo (51%). In addition, time on medication significantly affected the relapse rate.
Fourteen patients completed at least one post-baseline evaluation; eight completed the study. Duloxetine was associated with significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) in pain, severity of illness, quality of life, loose stool, work and family disability, and anxiety. However, duloxetine did not improve hard stool. Although we found no evidence of serious duloxetine toxicity, seven participants withdrew over the course of the study because of adverse drug events.
For males, post-treatment PRL levels were significantly higher in the typical neuroleptic group compared with the melperone (p = 0.0001) and clozapine (p = 0.0001) groups, with no significant difference between clozapine and melperone. For females, post-treatment PRL levels were significantly higher in the melperone group as compared to the clozapine group (p = 0.004). There were too few typical neuroleptic-treated females to permit analysis of this sample. However, the cross-sectional analysis of PRL data confirmed the results for melperone- and clozapine-treated females, and showed higher PRL levels in typical neuroleptic-treated females as compared with those who received melperone and clozapine.
There is clear overlap between the assessment of wakefulness and cognition. There are common techniques which may be used to assess both concepts; aspects of the neurobiology of both concepts may be closely related; and wake-promoting drugs may have nootropic properties (and vice versa). Clinical trials of wake-promoting drugs often, though not routinely, assess aspects of cognition.
The result showed an unweighted kappa value of 0.61, a linear weighted kappa value of 0.71, and a quadratic weighted kappa value of 0.81. The determined accuracy was 92% and 91% for the two most urgent categories, but significantly lower for the less urgent categories.
The review demonstrated that children with removable splints preferred them to casts, in terms of improved physical functioning and lower pain scores reported after initial injury than those with casts. Children demonstrated this by using their wrists in the first week after injury to shower and bathe more easily. The cast group reported unscheduled visits to ED due to problems with the cast, such as discomfort or re-application of the cast from getting it wet. Using a splint will have considerable economic implications, money was found to be saved in terms of time and resource management. Radiographs taken at 4 weeks in both the cast and splint group confirmed that all fractures healed without significant change in alignment, suggesting that neither clinical nor radiographic follow-up is necessary for injury.
Allergic patients had significantly higher levels of both sHLA-G (p&lt;0.001) and sHLA-A, -B, -C (p=0.001) than normal controls. In addition, there was a very strong correlation between sHLA-G levels and clinical severity.
The subconjunctival injection of ACTH1-17 plasmid augmented the concentration of alpha-MSH in the aqueous humor of all post-EAU mice. The injection of ACTH1-17 suppressed the severity of EAU in the B10.RIII and C57BL/6 mice but the MC5r((-/-)) mice. In all the models of EAU, the ACTH1-17 injection helped to preserve the structural integrity of the retina; however, post-EAU aqueous humor was not immunosuppressive.
Despite a slight decrease in tacrolimus trough levels, no significant change in T-cell-function biomarkers was observed after conversion. After a follow-up of 6 (4-30) months, five patients were cleared of the virus, and decreased viral load was observed in four patients. Only one patient suffered a graft loss. No difference in immunological parameters was observed between patients who were cleared or not of BKV.
We found a positive association between amount smoked and cue response: peer cues (1.06, 95%CI: 0.74-1.38) and psychological cues (0.44, 95%CI = 0.17-0.70). Response to psychological cues was lower among male smokers (-1.62, 95%CI = -2.26-(-)0.98), but response to psychological cues were higher among those who had senior high school level education (0.96, 95%CI = 0.40-1.53) and who began smoking as a response to their moods (1.25, 95%CI = 0.68-1.82).
All studies related to tobacco control and listed in the ISI database since 1900 were identified by the use of defined search terms. Using bibliometric approaches, a continuous increase in qualitative markers such as collaboration numbers or citations were found for tobacco control research. The combination with density equalizing mapping revealed a distinct global pattern of research productivity and citation activity. Radar chart techniques were used to visualize bi- and multilateral research cooperation and institutional cooperation.
The frequency of finding mosquito larvae in the treatment areas was reduced by 70% resulting in a loss of spatial larval clusters compared to those found in the control areas. This effect was observed directly following OMWM treatment and remained significant throughout the study period. The greatly reduced frequency of finding larvae in the treatment areas led to a significant decrease (approximately 44%) in the number of times when the larviciding threshold was reached. This reduction, in turn, resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 74%) in the number of larvicide applications in the treatment areas post-project. The remaining larval habitat in the treatment areas had a different geographic distribution and was largely confined to the restored marsh surface (i.e. filled-in mosquito ditches); however only approximately 21% of the restored marsh surface supported mosquito production.
INAHTA includes organizations that provide health technology assessment (HTA) advice to governments and receive most of their funding from public sources. In early 2009, there were forty-six members from twenty-seven countries, including both national and regional agencies. Interaction with other organizations includes links to Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi), the European Union Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA), PAHO (the Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization (WHO). An important feature of INAHTA is the routine interaction of its members with public sector decision makers. Output from the network has included guidelines and frameworks on HTA, reports of surveys, and joint projects.
Most HTA activity in Australia has been associated with provision of advice for the two national subsidy programs, Medicare, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). National advisory bodies established by the federal government have had a prominent role. Assessments from the advisory bodies have had a major influence on decisions related to Medicare and the PBS, and in some other areas. Technologies without links to the national subsidy schemes, and those that are widely distributed, have been less well covered by HTA. To some extent these are addressed by evaluations supported by state governments, but details of approaches taken are not readily available.
Austria is a latecomer in implementing evaluations/HTA as decision support. It can to a certain degree absorb the increasing international knowledge. Austria had a long time to observe the successes and failures of HTA in other countries and to learn from other countries. The implementation of HTA within the Austrian healthcare system ran through stages of uptake: starting 1989 with a systematic review on international activities, first international networking and collaboration since 1991, proposed assessments until the late 1990s, followed by reactive assessments on demand mostly on high volume and costly technologies since then. Since 2000, HTA is used on a regular basis for investment and reimbursement decisions by several players, namely the Ministry of Health, the Social Insurance and hospital cooperations. In 2006, the Austrian HTA-institute was founded.
Belgium has a relatively young history in HTA. The principle of evidence-based medicine (EBM) was introduced in the drug reimbursement procedure in 2001, with the establishment of the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC). The DRC assesses the efficacy, safety, convenience, applicability, and effectiveness of a drug relative to existing treatment alternatives. For some drugs, relative cost-effectiveness is also evaluated. The activities of the DRC can, therefore, be considered to be the first official HTA activities in Belgium. Later, in 2003, KCE was established. Its mission was to perform policy preparing research in the healthcare and health insurance sector and to give advice to policy makers about how they can obtain an efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources that optimizes the quality and accessibility of health care. This broad mission has been operationalized by activities in three domains of research: HTA, health services research, and good clinical practice. KCE is independent from the policy maker. Its HTAs contain policy recommendations that may inform policy decisions but are not binding.
Health technology assessment (HTA) entered the political agenda in Germany only in the mid-1990s, basically as the result of a top-down approach toward more efficiency in health care, but with a strong impetus of an evidence-based medicine movement. Accordingly, HTA became part of several healthcare reform laws since 1997, which led to the establishment of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) and the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) in 2004. This tandem construction aims at using evidence in decision-making processes for coverage and other decisions.
The present HTA-related landscape is a product of a dynamic, somewhat turbulent path in the United States. Many early aggressive federal efforts beginning in the 1970s were rejected in the 1980s only to be revived by the mid-1990s and continue to strengthen today, likely due to diffusing private sector political opposition from de-linking HTA from policy decisions (e.g., coverage, clinical guidelines) and omitting economic evaluation. Meanwhile, private sector HTA efforts have remained active during the entire period.
An external evaluation in 2003 indicated that HTA was widely disseminated and that HTA results were benefitting political, administrative, and clinical decision making at all levels of the healthcare system.
In recent years, HTA is becoming an important tool for decision-making processes at central, regional, and local levels. In particular, the National Agency for Regional Health Services (AGENAS) and five regions (of twenty-one) are strongly committed to develop HTA initiatives connected with the planning process.
Spain has undergone radical change in many aspects, but the changes in healthcare provision have been major indeed. Catalonia has had the ability to benefit from these changes and has been able to build upon professionals' experience and expertise to development a consistent HTA network and continuous evaluation paradigm. The early involvement of the Catalan Agency for Health Technology Assessment (CAHTA) in several relevant HTA international initiatives and the relationship of CAHTA and Research with other HTA agencies in Spain is also stressed.
HTA originated in Israel as a centralized function conducted under the auspice of research, developing into an active multidisciplinary center. Throughout the expansion of the field, HTA was performed in affiliation with several local and international bodies, while providing direct and indirect support at the national level. Today, mainly as a result of vigorous dissemination of the principles, methodology and tools for HTA by the Israeli Center for Technology Assessment in Health Care (ICTAHC), this discipline is increasingly a decentralized activity conducted by a great variety of institutions. Israeli health policy decisions are increasingly based on the results of HTA.
The Norwegian HTA activity was set up rather late compared to, for instance, Sweden, and our involvement in Nordic early warning activities. This may be related to Norwegian scientists being more involved in the Cochrane Collaboration. However, when established, the HTA agency was regarded as highly successful in involving clinical experts and responding to questions arising from the macro- as well as micro-levels of decision makers. International collaboration was essential in building the capacity to serve all levels. After 6 years, the agency was merged with some related health service knowledge activities, into a new center.
The United Kingdom has been characterized historically as a country with a strong interest in evidence in health care, both clinical trials for efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this evidence was not well-linked to the needs of the National Health Services (NHS) before formation of the NHS R&amp;D Programme in 1991, The R&amp;D Programme brought substantial resources into HTA and related activities, with the central aim of improving health care in Britain and increasing value for money. However, policy makers as well as staff of the R&amp;D Programme were dissatisfied with the use of the HTA results in clinical and administrative practice. Therefore, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) was formed in 1999. NICE issues guidance intended to influence practical decision making in health care at the national and local levels, based on efficacy information and, in some cases, economic analyses. NICE is now also seeking ways to maximize impacts on practice.
HTA in South Korea has been developed since 1990s, first introduced by academia and institutionalized within the National Health Insurance (NHI). Rapidly increasing expenditure had been a challenge of the NHI, which considered health technology management as a cost controlling measure. An amendment was made to the NHI Law in 2000, and provision was made to regulate the process of determining new insurance benefits including procedures, drugs, and equipment. This requirement made the NHI agencies to promote HTA approaches in connection with the government and professional organizations. Also the Healthcare Act was revised in October 2006 ruling that HTA focusing on safety and effectiveness be responsible for new health technologies. Currently, the HTA process is governed by a governmental committee comprising twenty members and technically supported by the HTA center created in the NHI structure.
A major challenge is sustainability of the program, to be able to have trained personnel competent to take on the demanding tasks of assessments and the sustained efforts that are required. In addition, there need to be constant efforts to create awareness of the utility of HTA so that its services are used and its full potential realized. The scope of services may also need to be expanded to include an early warning system.
Evidence suggests that contextual elements of the health system, especially the country's economic status and health financing reforms, as well as their effects on government budgeting for medical and public health services, played an important role in the increasing needs and demands for HTA information among policy makers. In the midst of substantial economic growth during the years 1982 to 1996, several studies reported the rapid diffusion and poor distribution of health technologies, and inequitable access to high-cost technology in public and private hospitals. At the same time, economic analysis and its underpinning concept of efficiency were suggested by groups of scholars and health officials to guide national policy on the investment in health technology equipment. Related research and training programs were subsequently launched. However, none of these HTA units could be institutionalized into national bodies. From 1997 to 2005, an economic recession, followed by the introduction of a universal health coverage plan, triggered the demands for effective measures for cost containment and prioritization of health interventions. This made policy makers and researchers at the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) pay increasing attention to economic appraisals, and several HTA programs were established in the Ministry. Despite the rising number of Thai health economic publications, a major problem at that period involved the poor quality of studies. Since 2006, economic recovery and demands from different interests to include expensive technologies in the public health benefit package have been crucial factors promoting the role of HTA in national policy decisions. Meanwhile, HTA capacity has been strengthened through the establishment of many health economic and HTA initiatives. An illustration of the work and contributions of the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) is provided. In this phase, HTA policy integration has been enhanced through different mechanisms and organizations.
Argentina is an upper-middle income country with major healthcare problems related to both equity and efficiency. Its healthcare system consists of a multitier system divided in three large sectors: public, social security, and private, where the federal Ministry of Health has a rather limited role in national health policy stewardship. Many of Argentina's shortcomings are due in part to its pluralistic and fragmented healthcare system. In the past decade, Argentina, like many other Latin American countries, has undergone a profound reform of its healthcare system. Whereas some of the objectives of the reforms were specific to each country, a common issue among all of them was to establish a mechanism that ensured a more efficient allocation of scarce resources, and guaranteed a wider provision of healthcare services on the basis of the local population needs and equity. Although some signals from the national government and congress show that there are plans to formally incorporate HTA to inform reimbursement policies, these signals are still very weak. Paradoxically, even though Argentina was the first country in the region to require formal health economic evidence for the adoption of technologies into the mandatory benefit package of the social security, this "fourth hurdle" is no longer required. Nevertheless, there is an increasing interest and demand for a more explicit and transparent resource-allocation process that include HTA as a formal tool to inform decision making, in most of Argentine healthcare stakeholders.
HTA efforts were developed in Mexico since the mid-1980s with the participation both of academics and of policy makers, a relationship that eventually led to the creation of the Center for Technological Excellence within the Ministry of Health.
The interest in HTA and evaluation as a tool for health decision making goes back to the 1970s in France. During the 1980s, there were several attempts to develop a national HTA agency, which finally came to fruition with the development of the Agence Nationale de l'Evaluation Medicale (ANDEM) in 1989. ANDEM's main success, perhaps, was in making HTA known in France by developing its own assessments, writing and validating appropriate methodologies for assessing medical technology and medical practices, and by organizing in France the development of programs of consensus development conferences, which the ANDEM either organized itself or supported and validated. In the mid-1990s, the mandate of ANDEM was extended to hospital accreditation and the agency's name was changed to Agence Nationale d'Accreditation et d'Evaluation en Sante (ANAES). Finally, in 2005, the National Authority for Health (HAS) was formed to consolidate efforts to centralize the programs of HTA, aiming at helping decision making regarding reimbursement and pricing, in one agency and to define the optimal use of health technology in France.
In the past, remarkable work in HTA was done. Accomplishments include the following: (i) Switzerland became an early member of the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment. (ii) HTA has its legal bases in terms of effectiveness, appropriateness, and efficiency. (iii) The federal law allows the introduction of new technologies for a limited time for evaluation. (iv) A Swiss Network for Health Technology Assessment was established. In 2004, federal HTA activities moved from the Swiss Federal Office "of Social Security" to the one for "Public Health." The Office mainly mandates, manages, and coordinates evaluations attached to its prevention and intervention sections in the fields of AIDS, illegal drugs, and legal drugs.
It is important that once HTA is established, it is used effectively. Perseverance and dedication is needed to ensure the success of an HTA program.
HTA has been progressively developed in The Netherlands since (at least) the early 1980s. Beginning in 1985, there were progressive attempts to expand and institutionalized HTA in The Netherlands healthcare system. These attempts were generally successful, but did not result in a national agency for HTA. An important development in HTA in The Netherlands was a special fund (Ontwikkelingsgeneeskunde) designed to support prospective HTAs with the main purpose of affecting insurance coverage decisions. The administration of this fund moved progressively to broaden the subjects chosen for analysis to include such subjects as chronic illness and disability. A more-or-less hidden conflict developed in the question of the leadership and orientation of this fund, with the result that it was largely moved to a more research-oriented and less policy-oriented site.
HTA was introduced in the late 1980s. The main factors were the trend to an increase in healthcare expenditure, concerns regarding efficiency in providing health care, as well as in the level of rationality introducing high technology. Spain has direct (i.e., regulation) and indirect (i.e., payment systems, evidence-based programs, HTA) mechanisms to control health technologies. A recent high priority regulation has established the need of HTA to decide the introduction of a new health technology in the lists of public healthcare coverage, although similar regulations existed in the past and were scarcely implemented. HTA initiatives started at the regional government level. Its introduction followed a progressive pattern among regions. In the beginning, resources were scarce and expertise limited, with work done at intramural level. With time, expertise increase, and promotion of commissioned work was implemented. HTA knowledge transfer in the healthcare system has been carried out through courses, publications, and commissioned research. Currently, there are seven HTA units/agencies, which coordinate their work.
The program is known as the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). HTA was introduced to the Philippines in 1998. PhilHealth began to develop an HTA program subsequently.
Interest in HTA in Brazil began in the mid-1980s. Several seminars and consultations were held, often with invited foreign participants. A cadre of people with knowledge and expertise in HTA was gradually developed. In 2003, several policies were developed by the federal government of Brazil to encourage HTA and base clinical, management, and policy decisions on HTA. During the past 5 years, institutional development has been rapid in government, private companies (mainly prepaid health plans), academia, and research institutes. Further policy changes are needed to maximize the impact of these developments. Nevertheless, although the growing network of HTA programs will have a considerable impact on Brazilian health care, further institutional development could stimulate this change.
Historical steps of HTA development are as follows: in 1993, a few conferences on HTA; eight people were trained in Sweden at SBU; the book First Steps of HTA in Lithuania (5) was issued together with SBU in 1993; participation in the International Society of Technology Assessment in Health Care (ISTAHC) conferences; participation in development of training courses and European networks of HTA; new people in HTA were trained in health accreditation service, Sickness Fund, and Ministry of Health. The major step was establishment of an evidence-based medicine library. In 1994, Article 54 in the Health Care System Law, which declares that the use of healthcare technologies that have not been assessed or approved shall be prohibited, except in cases provided by law, was passed. The procedure of healthcare technologies assessment and approval was to be established by the Ministry of Health Care. A policy of HTA was approved with the program for HTA in 1999 in the Ministry of Health. Currently, enthusiasts of HTA fully realize that technology assessment is a developing frontier for creative and constructive thinking from all disciplinary view points.
With its rapid economic development, the Chinese health system has had many achievements in the past 30 years. However, there are some weaknesses that have developed during this period. HTA is traced back to the early 1990s in China. First, HTA knowledge transfer and establishment of HTA units were effective ways to develop HTA in China. By the end of 1990s, the policy makers of the Ministry of Health (MoH) made efforts to merge HTA with policy making to improve the quality and efficiency of health care. The main government authorities related to health technology are the State Food and Drug Administration, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, and the MoH. Their involvements in HTA are varied.
There was limited evidence of reduction in agitation in people on active treatment, sleep was improved and a suggestion of greater efficacy in the winter months.
The balance confidence of elderly women was lower than that of elderly men, although the physical performances of men and women under the age of 80 were similar. Women showed increased functional disability related to lower extremity pain and closely associated with balance confidence. However, psychological variables such as depression and cognitive functioning did not affect balance confidence.
Forced displacement in WWII is significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of resilience and life satisfaction 60 years later. In regression analyses, forced displacement in WWII significantly predicted current anxiety (beta 0.07; p &lt; 0.01), life satisfaction (beta -0.06; p &lt; 0.05) and resilience (beta -0.07; p &lt; 0.01).
Results indicated that 14-59% of patients with MCI had sleep disturbances. These disturbances were often identified as one of the four most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms of MCI and were considered as clinically significant in some studies. In addition, there was some evidence that the prevalence of sleep disturbances in MCI is intermediate between that of normal aging and dementia. Longitudinal data suggest that sleep problems are associated with both incident MCI and dementia.
Of 23 surveys sent out, 14 were returned. Most clinics are located in Victoria where they receive Victorian state funding. The average clinic has 1.67 effective full time clinical staff including 0.42 medical staff, 0.24 allied health staff, 0.53 clinical nursing staff and 0.48 psychologists. Clinics are open on average twice a week and each half-day clinic has two new and three review patients, seeing new patients twice initially then once more over 12 months. Patients wait 10 weeks for initial assessment with 59% referred by general practitioners. The Mini-mental State Examination and clock drawing are utilized universally. The most common diagnoses are Alzheimer's disease (37.8%) and mild cognitive impairment (19.8%) but 6.9% of patients have no cognitive impairment.
1267 patients were referred to the service, of whom 379 (30%) were assessed for capacity. The most common mental capacity issues were placement (303 assessed of whom 54% lacked capacity), treatment (86 assessed, 59% lacking capacity) and finances (70 assessed, 79% lacking capacity). Cognitive impairment, dementia and delirium, rather than mental disorders were associated with incapacity. Those assessed and deemed to lack capacity for placement decisions were twice as likely to be placed in a care home, and four times as likely to be placed in an elderly mentally ill (EMI) facility, independent of dementia diagnosis and cognitive functioning.
The best predictors of on-road driving were the Ergovision and Useful Field of View (UFOV) tests, a complex RT task, Paper Folding task, Dot Counting, WMS Visual Reproduction, and Computerized Visual Attention Task. Simulator driving performance was best predicted by the Benton Line Orientation Task, Clock Drawing, a Driver Scanning task, the UFOV, WAIS Picture Arrangement and MMSE. Finally, the Trail Making Test, Stroop, UFOV, WAIS Block Design, and Automated Psychophysical Test were good predictors of driving problems.
Significant predictors for the utilization of SRC are the assessment of the helpfulness of SRC and the caregiver's knowledge of the accessibility of SRC facilities. Family caregivers who had already used SRC most frequently expressed the wish for "good care" in SRC facilities, followed by a program of suitable activities for dementia patients.
The first section focuses on clinical aspects and summarizes findings regarding prevalence, causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and management of persons with EOD. The second section focuses on social aspects related to the cost of care for young people with the disease, the challenges faced by individuals and caregivers, and the services available for this population. Finally, conclusions and future directions are suggested.
Resident characteristics included a mean MMSE of 10.44 indicating moderate to severe dementia and a mean of 3.44 medical co-morbidities. Fifty-six percent of the participants had one epsilon4 allele. A significant difference was found between APOE epsilon4+/4- and mean behavioral scores (F(1,31)) = 4.40, p = 0.04). Restlessness was significantly inversely correlated with MMSE (r = -0.367, p = 0.03), but not APOE genotype. There was no significant correlation between proxy reporting and direct observation (r = 0.257, p = 0.13).
A total of 1166 volunteers were recruited, 54 of whom were excluded from further study due to comorbid disorders which could affect cognition or because of withdrawal of consent. Participants with AD (211) had neuropsychological profiles which were consistent with AD, and were more impaired than participants with mild cognitive impairment (133) or healthy controls (768), who performed within expected norms for age on neuropsychological testing. PiB PET scans were performed on 287 participants, 100 had DEXA scans and 91 participated in ActiGraph monitoring.
There was a significant increase in the rates of attempted suicide over the study period in the age-band 60-74 years, but not in the age-band 75+ years. There was a positive correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in the age-band 75+ years, but not in the age-band 60-74 years.
Our panel judged that 15 (6.8%) of carers reported potentially clinical concerning abusive behavior; but 47 (21%) were cases according to the Pillemer criteria and 74 (34%) using the MCTS conventional scoring system. We developed a weighted MCTS scoring system, with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting clinically concerning abuse.
23/83 probable AD cases and 32/87 possible AD cases met probable criteria for another dementia, more commonly DLB than FTD. AD pathology was present in 8/15 probable AD and 8/12 possible AD cases coming to autopsy. DLB pathology was seen in four cases and FTD pathology in eight cases. In the AD cases reaching clinical diagnosis for a second dementia syndrome and coming to autopsy, a minority showed non-AD pathology only.
Charts for 30 patients with mania (23 men and 7 women with mean (+/-SD) age of 68.5(+/- 5.75 years) and 92 with depression (47 men and 45 women with mean (+/-SD) age of 68.18 (+/-6.0 years) were evaluated. Fifteen patients (50%) with manic episodes had psychotic symptoms in the form of delusions and hallucinations while only 33 (35.8%) depressed patients had psychotic symptoms. One-third of manic patients received mood stabilizers at index visit. More than half (n = 16; 53.3%) of the patients in the mania group were prescribed antipsychotic medications. On cognitive functions, patients with manic episodes scored poorly compared with those with depression.
In the 799 obituaries studied, chronological age, suggested donations in memory of the deceased, and donations to dementia charities were each included in significantly more obituaries in Canadian newspapers than in U.K. ones. Military service was explicit for significantly more men aged &gt; or = 80 years in Canada compared to the U.K. (41% versus 4%; p &lt; 0.05). Of the donations to medical charities, nearly half (n = 117) were to cancer charities and one-fifth (54) to heart and stroke foundations. In the U.K., obituaries for those aged &gt; or = 70 years were more likely to recommend donations to children's charities (n = 12) or the Royal National Lifeboat Institution than dementia charities.
At Time 1, 60% of the sample exhibited anxiety symptoms at a sub-case level, while 16% had anxiety symptoms at a syndrome case level, whereas 48% of the participants had depression at syndrome level. The HADS and AGECAT were concordant with respect to anxiety for 78% of participants, but agreement was lower for depression; AGECAT identified a further 36 syndrome cases of depression not deemed depressed by the HADS. There was a significant decrease in overall rates of both depression and anxiety symptoms and syndromes from Time 1 to Time 2.
Eight studies from six countries were included. The global prevalence of dementia in the elderly (&gt; or =65 years) was 7.1% (95% CI: 6.8-7.4), mirroring the rates of developed countries. However, prevalence in relatively young subjects (65-69 years) was higher in LA studies The rate of illiteracy among the elderly was 9.3% and the prevalence of dementia in illiterates was two times higher than in literates. Alzheimer's disease was the most common cause of dementia.
Three main themes were identified: (i) the intense fears associated with witnessing the decline of the older care recipient and the subsequent employment of a foreign home care worker; (ii) actual negative experiences within this caregiving setting; and (iii) the ways in which family members and older care recipients coped with these challenging experiences.
After implementation of the ERP, the number of replacement doses indicated but not given was reduced for magnesium from 60% to 35% (p=0.18) and for phosphate from 100% to 64% (p=0.04). The time to replacement was reduced for potassium from 79 to 60 min (p=0.066) and for magnesium from 307 to 151 min (p=0.15). Nurses and physicians were satisfied with the ERP.
The response rate was 77%. From responding ICUs the majority (96%) stated they performed MH; 27% as a daily routine procedure, 69% performed MH on indication only. MH was mainly performed by ICU nurses. Half of ICUs reported to have a MH guideline available. Improved oxygenation and better removal of sputum were presumed benefits of MH. While slow inspiration and rapid expiration are considered to be essential elements of MH procedures, the majority of respondents stated to use rapid inspiration and slow expiration.
Analysis revealed four major themes: (a) exhausting patient treatments; (b) promoting family presence; (c) acknowledging physician authority; and (d) walking a fine line.
Two main themes emerged; 'feeling exposed and powerless', and 'seeking safety and empathy'. The categories identified in the first theme were "the dilemma of becoming an adolescent mother" and "lack of decision power". In the second theme the following categories were identified: "cultural practices and beliefs about birth", "expectations and experiences", "transport, a key determinant to health seeking", and "dealing with constraints". Adolescents felt exposed and powerless due to the dilemma of early motherhood and lack of decision making power. The adolescent mothers seemed to be in continuous quest for safety and empathy. In so doing they are part of cultural practices and beliefs about birth. They had expectations about the health care services but their experiences of the services were rather negative. Transport was a key determinant for health seeking and adolescents to some extent had learnt how to cope with constraints they face.
Nurse coordinators used a paper-based information tool (a nurse coordinator's clipboard) that consisted of the compilation of essential data from disparate information sources. The tool was assembled twice daily through (1) selecting and formatting key data from multiple information systems (such as the unit census and the EHR), (2) data reduction (e.g., by cutting and whitening out non-essential items from the print-outs of computerized information systems), (3) bundling (e.g., organizing pieces of information and taping them to each other), and (4) annotating (e.g., through the use of colored highlighters and shorthand symbols). It took nurse coordinators an average of 41min to assemble the clipboard. The design goals articulated by nurse coordinators to fit the tool into their tasks included (1) making information compatible with the mobile nature of their work, (2) enabling rapid information access and note-taking under time pressure, and (3) supporting rapid information processing and attention management through the effective use of layout design, shorthand symbols, and color-coding.
Survey respondents averaged 5.8+/-4.1 years of CCT experience, with a median total of 1200 contrast-enhanced CCT examinations performed and interpreted. Cardiologists (40; 55.6%) and radiologists (32; 44.4%) were included. Five of 12 previously "uncertain" indications shifted to "appropriate," resulting in a total of 18 "appropriate" of 39 possible indications. Conversely, all previously "appropriate" indications remained so. Among the 14 previously "inappropriate" indications, 10 shifted to "uncertain," none to "appropriate." Overall, 26 of 39 indications showed increased appropriateness scores (range of shift, 1-4 points; median value, 1; interquartile range, 0-2). No significant differences were observed between US and non-US expert respondents or between cardiology and radiology respondents in the overall appropriateness category ratings.
CCTA was performed in 14 patients during a single heart beat applying a pitch value of 3.4. Mean heart rate during examination was 56.4+/-8.1 beats/min. Diagnostic image quality for the assessment of larger cardiac structures was obtained in all patients, whereas diagnostic image quality could be achieved in 82% of all coronary segments. With a mean DLP of 145+/-47 mGy x cm, the resulting estimated radiation dose was 2.0+/-0.7 mSv.
Six coronary stents (2.5, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0mm) were analyzed by 2 independent readers. Interobserver correlation was high for both HDCT and SDCT. HDCT yielded substantially larger luminal area visualization compared with SDCT, both for smooth (29.4+/-14.5 versus 20.1+/-13.0; P&lt;0.001) and sharp (32.0+/-15.2 versus 25.5+/-12.0; P&lt;0.001) kernels. Stent diameter was higher with HDCT compared with SDCT, for both smooth (1.54+/-0.59 versus1.00+/-0.50; P&lt;0.0001) and detailed (1.47+/-0.65 versus 1.08+/-0.54; P&lt;0.0001) kernels. With detailed kernels, HDCT scans that used algorithms showed a trend toward decreased image noise compared with SDCT-filtered backprojection algorithms.
The mean effective dose was 5.7+/-1.7 mSv (range, 1.6-11.1 mSv) for 151 patients (75%) scanned with a one-heart beat acquisition. Qualitative image quality was assessed to be in good to excellent range, and mottle image quality was in low-to-medium mottle range. For patients scanned with 2- or 3-heart beat acquisition, radiation dose was higher with mean exposures of 13.0+/-3.3 mSv and 19.5+/-5.3 mSv, respectively.
Of the 500 CCTAs performed on ED patients in the Lenox Hill laboratory, 5 patients (1%) were imaged during the initial phase of an unsuspected acute myocardial infarction; in all cases the CCTAs were key to the diagnosis. The imaging characteristics were (1) total or subtotal occlusion and (2) transmural hypodensity in the infarct area.
Administration of 8-OH-DPAT elicited hyperphagia and decreased 5-HT metabolism in normal diet treated rats. The neurochemical and hyperphagic responses to 8-OH-DPAT were smaller in sugar than normal diet treated animals suggesting a downregulation of somatodendritic responses in sugar diet treated animals.
All 291 cases had ETT, 130 cases were found positive, 161 had negative ETT. When CA was done on 130 positive cases, 95 had CAD (true positive, TP) and 35 had normal coronaries (false positive, FP). Out of the 161 negative ETT cases, 128 had normal coronaries (true negative, TN) and 33 had CAD (false negative, FN). TST was conducted on 196 cases, out of which 78 cases were found positive and 118 had negative TST. When subjected to CA, out of 78 positive cases, 30 had CAD (TP) and 48 had normal coronaries (FP). Out of 118 negative TST cases, 115 had normal coronaries (TN) and 3 had CAD (FN). ETT was found to have sensitivity of 74.2%, specificity of 78.5%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 73.1%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 79.5% and test accuracy of 76.6%. TST had sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 70.6%, PPV of 38.5%, NPV of 97.5% and accuracy of 74.0%.
Three of one hundred cases showed flare-ups after treated in single appointment. On the other hand, a marked number (n=97) of cases did not show flare-ups during the study period. None of the studied variables showed any statistically significant bearing on rate of flare-ups in single appointment root canal treatment.
A total of 42 patients were operated electively for malignant stricture esophagus through transhiatal approach. Site of lesion were 5 (11.9%) upper, 13 (31%) middle and 24 (58%) at lower end of esophagus. The TNM staging were stage I, IIa, IIb, III and IV in zero (0), 5 (11%), 10 (22%), 24 (57.8%) and 3 (7.1%) respectively. Mean operating time was 154 minutes and average blood loss of 371 ml. Postoperative complications included pneumothorax 16.7%, pulmonary complication (16.7%), anastomotic leakage (9.5%), wound infection (3.4%), recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (4.8%) and stricture formation (4.8%). Only 3 (7.1%) 30-day in-hospital mortality was recorded.
Steatosis was present in 46 patients and graded as mild (41.3%), moderate (54.3%) and severe (4.3%). An overall significant correlation was found between grades of steatosis with stage of fibrosis (p &lt; 0.0001) but no correlation was found with necro-inflammatory grades. Only focal necrosis revealed weak correlation with grades of steatosis (p &lt; 0.003).
The mean WHR had significant correlation with both systolic and diastolic BP in all groups of HTN, as well as with blood glucose level in control and pre-HTN groups. BMI was positively correlated with cholesterol (r=0.29) and triglyceride (r=0.25) in HTN stage-1. Impaired and high blood glucose levels were found in pre-HTN group; all lipid parameters except triglycerides were higher in HTN stage I.
There were 50 confirmed cases of rickets in each group. The mean age was 10.9+5.1 months and 14.7+8.1 months in group A and B respectively. In these children, clinical features were weakness, difficulty in walking, frontal bossing, ribcage deformity and widening of wrist were seen. After one dose of vitamin-D (cholecalciferol), there was appreciable gain of weight and height and raised levels of alkaline phosphatase became normal during follow-up. Radiological florid rickets and non-florid rickets in both groups healed clinically during follow-up period. Oral and injectable forms of vitamin-D (cholecalciferol) were effective but injectable form was shown to be statistically significant. There were no undesirable side effects and both forms of treatment were well-tolerated.
There were a total of 282 patients studied. The number of patients in group A were 162 and in group B, 120. Anaemia 98 (60.49%), pregnancy induced hypertension 24 (14.8%) and preterm labour 26 (16%) were identified as the major risk factors in group A. There were 12 (7.40%) stillbirths and 5 (3.08%) early neonatal deaths in group A, while there was 1 (0.84%) stillbirth and no neonatal death in group B (p=0.004, RR=1.72). There were 58 (35.80%) neonates with low birth weight in group A, while the same were only 4 (3.33%) in group B, which was statistically significant (p=0.001, RR=1.98). Poor Apgar score of &lt; or = 7 at 1 minute was observed in 6 (4%) and at 5 min was observed in 5 (3.33%), while none of the neonates in group B was born with Apgar score of less &lt; or = 7 at 1 or 5 minute (p=0.036, RR=1.83; p=0.068, tR=1.82 respectively). Meconium aspiration syndrome was observed in 7 (4.3%) cases in group A, and 2 (1.66%) in group B, which was statistically insignificant. Complication rate among the neonates was statistically not significant between the two groups.
Among the 50 patients, there were 45 (90%) males and 5 (10%) females. Average age of the patients was 31.52 +9.52 (ranging from 20 to 50) years. The pre-operatively visual acuity finger counting to perception of light was 78% cases. The best corrected final visual acuity was 6/6 in 1 (2%) patient, 6/9 in 5 (10%) patients, 6/12 in 5 (10%) patients, 6/18 in 3 (6%) patients, 6/24 and 6/36 in 4 (8%) patients each, 6/60 in 4 (8%) patients, finger counting in 8 (16%) patients, hand movement in 4 (8%) patients, projection of light in 9 (18%) patients and no projection of light in 3 (6%) patients. The postoperative complications were corneal opacity in 8 (16%) patients, anterior chamber inflammatory reaction in 6 (12%) patients, increased intraocular pressure in 1 (2%) patient, silicone oil in anterior chamber in 1 (2%) patient, macular scar in 7 (14%) patients, cystoid macular edema in 1 (2%) patient, endophthalmitis in 4 (8%) patients, retinal detachment in 11 (22%) patients and phthisis bulbi in 3 (6%) patients.
The stool samples of 3870 patients with diarrhea were examined under microscope. Three hundred and twenty eight (8.47%) of these samples were positive for E.H. The difference between the number of patients presenting with acute watery diarrhea n=157, 47.86% and with dysentery n=171, 52.13% was found to be statistically non-significant (p=0.364). Two hundred and seventy seven (84.45%) patients had tenesmus, while abdominal pain was present in 287 (87.5%). Fever and malnutrition were present in 169 (51.52%) patients each. Malnutrition was significantly most frequent in 1-5 years of age groups (n=98, 57.98%, p=0.026). The nutritional evaluation of the 272 under-5 children with amoebic diarrhea showed a significantly normal status in 123 (45.55%, p-value &lt; 0.001). All the signs and symptoms followed a similar trend with 1-5 years age group being the most affected group. However, the frequency of blood in stools increased in direct proportion to the increasing age.
Here we demonstrate that an intrinsic limitation of %IBW method is that it largely ignores the statistical principle of regression to the mean. The key assumption of %IBW is that ideal weight-for-age is on exactly the same percentile ranking as height-for-age. We show that this assumption is only valid if the individual's height is close to the reference median. When the stature deviates from the median of the reference population, however, the increments of height-for-age and weight-for-age percentiles are not the same. In consequence, %IBW method systematically underestimates the ideal weight for smaller-than-average individuals, like CF-patients, which results in significant underestimation of the prevalence of malnutrition in this group of patients.
Overall monthly adherence to nebulised antibiotic therapy in 28 children was maintained between 60 and 70% over the year. Considerable variation in adherence, both between and within patients, was evident (Mean [SD] coefficient of variation, 37[44]%). Evening adherence (75[37]%) was better than morning adherence (58[34]%: p=0.012). Treatment regimens were changed in 8/28 patients based on adherence data.
All patients showed clinical and laboratory improvement (FEV(1) increase, serum IgE levels and total eosinophil counts decrease) and treatment was discontinued after 6-10 pulses. Adverse effects were minor and disappeared shortly after each IV pulse therapy.
Six pulmonary symptoms were identified as central to CF: cough, sputum production, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, and fever. Emotional impacts included frustration, sadness/depression, irritability, worry, difficulty sleeping; while activity impacts included time spent sitting or lying down, reduction of usual activities, and missing school or work. In all, 8 symptom items, 4 emotional impacts items, and 4 activity impacts were selected for inclusion on a new daily diary. We also assessed triggers for seeking care.
264 (64%) men participated, with a median age of 30 years (17-56). 65% knew of near universal infertility due to a transport problem. 43% heard about infertility from their preferred source, but significantly later than desired. Less than half had undergone semen analysis (SA), which, while varying by site, was consistently later than preferred. 57 men were fathers, of whom 29 had utilised ART.
Exposure on the previous day to PM(10) and O(3) had a positive association with hospital visits for CVD among elderly (&gt;or=65 years) individuals. The increase in CVD hospital visits in this age group was 0.10% (95% CI, 0.03-0.19) with a 10 microg/m(3) increase in PM(10), and 0.50% (95% CI, 0.19-0.81) with an increase in O(3).
Over 35 years, mean height increased from 164.4 to 169.2 cm, an increment of nearly 5 cm. The height increase was negligible in the first decade (1972-1981), but substantially accelerated after that. In the period after 1990 the increase exceeded 3 cm. A similar overall height gain in Britain occurred over a much longer period (1750-1886).
Our primary multivariate risk models indicated that low socioeconomic status was a strong predictor of ESRD (education: odds ratio [OR], 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-5.19; income: OR, 2.86, 95% CI, 1.48-5.52), even after adjusting for other risk factors. Other significant predictors for ESRD were a history of hypertension (OR, 3.63-3.90), history of diabetes (OR, 3.85-5.50), and regular intake of folk remedies or over-the-counter Chinese herbs (OR, 10.84-12.51). Regular intake of a multivitamin supplement 5 years before diagnosis was associated with a decreased risk of ESRD (OR, 0.12-0.14).
The most strongly perceived barrier was lack of time. Five of 9 sociodemographic attributes were significantly related to certain types of perceived barriers. Participants who more strongly perceived barriers were younger, more highly educated, more likely to be employed, and had relatively poor self-rated health and a high BMI. The specific types of barriers that were strongly perceived varied with the sociodemographic attributes of the participants.
Cancer was diagnosed and histologically confirmed in 362 patients (352 adenocarcinomas). The mean age of the patients was 64.57 +/- 11.32 (range, 16-94 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 2.8:1. The gastric cardia was involved in 40.3% of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, while the gastric fundus was involved in 3.7%, the gastric body in 49.1%, and the gastric antrum in 24.1% of patients. Complete evaluation for metastasis was possible in 144 patients; 61 were free of metastasis, and most of these patients underwent surgical therapy. Cardia involvement was not associated with the sex or age of patients.
Residence in the Stroke Belt was significantly associated with AF when diagnosed by SR plus ECG (multivariable-adjusted OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.92), but not when diagnosed with SR or ECG (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.06). Similarly, for the 4 methods used to detect AF, the strength of the association between black ethnicity and AF progressively decreased with increasing test sensitivity (ORs: 0.20, 0.40, 0.70, 0.71, respectively).
The incidence of hepatitis A has declined by 90% since 1990, from 56 to 5.9 per 10(5)/year. Declines in age-specific incidence were seen in all age groups, most dramatically among children younger than 10 years. Disease incidence still varies substantially: poorer western provinces have had the highest incidences since 2000. In high-incidence provinces, children younger than 10 years continue to have a high disease incidence. Only 50% of cases were laboratory-confirmed, and only 3% occurred in reported local outbreaks. Over 156 million doses of hepatitis A vaccine have been distributed since 1992, and use has continued to increase since 2003.
Consumption of P ovata tended to be inversely correlated with mortality from colorectal cancer. In the Poisson regression analysis this tendency remained and reached statistical significance for the top quintile of P ovata consumption in the adjusted analysis (P = 0.042).
Atrial coronary arteries extending to the LAA-LSPV region were found in 92 subjects (35%), while arteries crossing the mitral isthmus region were found in 119 subjects (46%). Atrial coronary arteries crossed the ablation line in about 69% of subjects overall.
We tested the catheter in 15 patients (mean age 61.1 +/- 7.9; eight men) scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation. The catheter was positioned in front of the pulmonary vein ostia. A pulmonary vein potential was demonstrated in 63.5% of the veins, which were disconnected with a mean of 1.6 radiofrequency applications with a mean time of 351 +/- 125.8 s (range 180-650) for each vein. Mean procedural time was 93 +/- 17.1 min (range 65-120), and fluoroscopy time was 13.7 +/- 4.0 (range 5-15) min. No complications occurred during and after or procedures.
Ninety-four lesion gaps were reviewed. The readers demonstrated a combined accuracy of 98.4% at identifying gaps.
We prospectively evaluated 47 consecutive patients with HF who were referred to our device optimization clinic. The mean patient age was 64.9 +/- 12.7 years. Patients were in both sinus rhythm (83%) and atrial fibrillation. Prior to device implant, 51% of patients had left bundle branch block (LBBB), 17% had intra-ventricular conduction delay (IVCD) and 21% were RV paced. Sixty-two percent were male, the mean QRS duration was 152 +/- 29 ms, mean LVEF 26 +/- 8% and 60% had a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Overall, 82% of patients required sequential pacing with 69% requiring LV pre-excitation to produce the best global cardiac function as determined by aortic velocity time integrals (VTI). In our cohort, none of the clinical characteristics evaluated, including etiology of the cardiomyopathy, QRS duration, LVEF, pre-implant rhythm or AV delay were predictive of an optimal simultaneous or sequential V-V setting.
In 23 anesthetized dogs, a combined laser and balloon-tipped endoscope was introduced into the right atrium after right thoracotomy. Koch's triangle was easily identified in all dogs endoscopically. Nd:YAG laser energy was delivered through an optical fiber positioned inside the saline-filled balloon to the middle portion of Koch's triangle in eight dogs (mid-Koch group) and to the posterior portion in 12 dogs (postero-Koch group). Complete AV block was achieved in five of eight dogs in the mid-Koch group. In the postero-Koch group, anterograde Wenckebach cycle length increased significantly from 178+/-23 ms to 202+/-37 ms (P = 0.008).
Of the 839 patients, 368 were &lt;65, 297 were 65-75, and 174 were &gt;75 years old. Compared with controls, patients from all three age groups, whose CRT was activated, had statistically significant improvements in NYHA class (-0.84 for age &lt;65, -0.78 for age 65-75, and -0.78 for age &gt;75). All age groups with CRT ON also had statistically significant improvements in left ventricular EF (5.23%, 2.98%, and 4.03% respectively). There were no between group differences by age in LVEF improvement.
The incidence of hypotension in the CRT-D group (N = 100) was 56%, as compared to 40% in the ICD group (N = 97). The mean duration of procedure in the CRT-D group was 114 +/- 95 min in the hypotensive subset versus 69 +/- 31.9 min in the non-hypotensive subset (p = 0.0015). The mean NYHA class in the hypotensive subset of the CRT-D group was 2.85 +/- 1.2 vs 2.2 +/- 1.5 in the non-hypotensive subset (p = 0.0179). Cumulative dose of propofol in the hypotensive subset of the CRT-D group was 386 +/- 22 mg, while that in the non hypotensive subset was 238.3 +/- 17 mg (p &lt; 0.0001). Creatinine clearance in the hypotensive subset of the CRT-D group was 63.8 +/- 12.8 ml/min, while that in the non-hypotensive subset was 78.7 +/- 23.5 ml/min (p = 0.003). Patients in the CRT-D group who developed hypotension had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction of 21.1 +/- 10.2% versus 29 +/- 14.8% in the non-hypotensive subset (p = 0.0035).
Three different interatrial routes were identified, either as solitary pathways (36/50 patients, 72%) or in their combinations (14/50). Bachmann's bundle (BB) was involved in the majority of the cases with solitary routes (25/36). More seldom, impulse propagation occurred near the oval fossa (FO) (7/36) or the coronary sinus ostium (4/36). In patients with combined routes, both the BB (10/14) and FO routes (11/14) were included in most cases.
A number of metrics based on kinematic performance were able to differentiate subjects with different impairment levels, with metrics associated with accuracy, steadiness and speed consistency showing the best capability. Significant differences were also shown on these metrics between various force field settings.
423 single brain metastases were treated with Gamma Knife and 73 with CyberKnife. Tumor volumes were similar. The parameters minimum tumor dose, maximum tumor dose, prescription isodose volume, conformality index, homogeneity index, volume of tissue receiving a dose of 10 Gy or more were significantly larger in Gamma Knife group. Sixty-three patients were good matches. These showed the same pattern in parameters. Concerning the outcome analysis, only overall survival differed significantly between groups, twice as long with CyberKnife (P &lt; 0.03). According to pooled data, dose was predictive of local failure, whole brain radiation therapy and chemotherapy were predictive of toxicity, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group score was predictive of survival after radiosurgery, and date of treatment was predictive of overall survival. No factor predicted new brain metastases, including whole brain radiation therapy.
Interval MRI follow-up demonstrated radiographic response in all patients with an average reduction of 79% for the post gadolinium studies and 49% for the FLAIR images. The initial partial radiographic response was noted for up to a mean follow-up time of 5.9 months (6 weeks to 18 months).
A total of 171 patients were recruited and tested. Seventy percent were diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) and 85% were undergoing therapy. Median KPS was 90% (range, 70-100%). Median 6MW distance was 400 m (range, 102-630 m), equivalent to 56 +/- 13% (range, 14-87%) of that predicted for age and sex. KPS, self-reported exercise, and QOL increased across 6MW distance quartiles (P &lt; 0.05) although there was considerable variation within each category. 6MW distance and KPS were significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.34, P &lt; 0.01) and several QOL domains (range, r = -0.43 to 0.46, P &lt; 0.05).
The median number of chemotherapy cycles delivered to each patient was 5 (range 3-6), with no patients discontinuing treatment because of refusal or toxicity. Dose reduction was required in 16 patients (10%), and all patients completed radiotherapy, whereas 5 patients discontinued chemotherapy before completing all planned cycles for disease progression. The primary toxicities were: neutropenia (grade 3-4: 23%), thrombocytopenia (grade 3-4: 18.5%), and nausea and vomiting (13%). Median progression-free survival times and 1-year progression free survival were 7.6 months (95% CI 6.6-8.5) and 17.3%, respectively. OS was 15.6 months (95% CI 14.1-17.1).
Statistical analysis demonstrated a threshold value of 2.91 for rCBV to provide sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 94.7, 93.75, 90.0, and 96.8%, respectively, in determining high-grade gliomas. An ADC value of 98.50 mm(2)/s was defined as a threshold below which tumors were classified as high-grade gliomas and a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90, 87.1, 81.81 and 93.10% respectively, were obtained. Significant differences were noted in the rCBV ratios, ADC and ADC ratios between low- and high-grade gliomas (P &lt; 0.0001).
Five patients with uveal melanoma were treated by this procedure. All patients had serous retinal detachment associated with the tumor. No grade &gt; or =2 acute toxicities were observed. Eight-month follow-up revealed a decrease in tumor thickness in three patients and reattachment of the retina in four. The tumors remained stable in two eyes and an increase in retinal detachment was noted in one eye. Vision improved minimally in two eyes and remained stable in three.
No significant difference was found in ERbeta mRNA expression levels between prolactinomas and gonadotrope tumors (P = 0.871), but there was a significant difference in the expression of ERalpha mRNA (P = 0.003). The significant difference was found between the two pituitary adenomas types in both levels of D2S and D2L mRNA expression (P = 0.036 and 0.007 respectively). Furthermore, both levels of expression in prolactinomas were significantly higher than that in gonadotrope tumors. Additionally, a negative correlation between D2S and ERalpha mRNA expression and a positive correlation between D2L and ERalpha mRNA expression were found in these tumors.
The mean total FIM-FAM score of the entire patient population was 167.5 (range 30-208). Scores in self care, sphincter control, mobility items, locomotion, communication items, psychological, and cognitive item domains were 39.49, 10.95, 22.70, 16.44, 28.93, 18.96, and 30.1, respectively. Univariate analysis showed total FIM-FAM scores not significantly different with age (&lt; or =35 years vs. &gt;35 years; P = 0.994), sex (male versus female; P = 0.133), and grade of the tumor (high-grade versus low-grade; P = 0.142) but were significantly higher in patients with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of &gt; or =70 as compared with &lt;70 (P = 0.001), neurological performance scale (NPS) of 0 or 1 vs. 2 or 3; P = 0.001), disease type (benign versus malignant; P = 0.001), and site of disease (cerebral versus cerebellar; P = 0.024). Multivariate analysis confirmed these findings for KPS (P = 0.001) and NPS (P = 0.012) only. Age was a significant factor for poorer cognitive function (P = 0.005), psychological (P = 0.045), and self care function (P = 0.001). A trend for correlation between tumor sites with the corresponding function as assesses on the FIM-FAM score was observed. Mobility domain scores were poor for left parietal domain and psychosocial for frontal lobe lesion. Pearson correlation test demonstrated a significant correlation between KPS and NPS with FIM-FAM scores (P = &lt;0.001). Average time to perform the FIM-FAM was 15-20 min.
A total of 34 patients were included with a mean NIHSS on admission of 14.2. This study revealed that PCT had 95% sensitivity and 71% specificity in the evaluation of therapy benefit as well as 75% sensitivity and 39% specificity in predicting clinical outcome. The extent of ischemic tissue according to PCT and TIBI grade were significantly correlated (p&lt;0.05). Using the MTT-TTP approach was an alternative to the classical MTT-CBV approach for determining tissue at risk. The clinical outcome assessed by the mRS was considered favorable (mRS 0-2) in 16 patients and unfavorable (mRS&gt;2) in 18 patients.
One hundred and forty-ninesessions of embolization were performed: one to eight sessions/patient with a mean of 3.0sessions. One hundred and sixteen sessions (77.9%) were performed with onyx, 20 sessions (13.4%) with glue and 13 sessions (8.7%) with onyx and glue. Symptomatic acute postembolization haemorrhage (APEH) was observed in four cases (8.0% per patient). At 1 month, morbidity and mortality related to the treatment were of 8% and 2%, respectively. Complete BAVM occlusion was obtained in 8.3% of cases. In the remaining cases, occlusion rate was between 99 and 80% in 56.3% of patients, 79 and 60% in 16.7%, and less than 60 in 18.7%. In case of incomplete occlusion, complementary treatment was performed by radiosurgery.
A total of 274 nurses returned the Round I questionnaire (response rate, 66%), and 249 returned the Round II questionnaire (response rate, 60%).
The education provider changes necessary for such a large professional workforce will need considerable leadership skills from within nursing and nurse management. At present, there are too many employers and education providers in England who appear to be relatively unaware of the changes facing nurse education and professional practice and the urgency needed to lead that change.
The results showed that the assessment tool in use at the time did not encompass all criteria assessors used and six areas were identified as those to include in any future tool.
The authors utilized historical reviews of nursing education within New Zealand and current work being undertaken by a national working party to implement a nationally consistent graduate nurse programme.
Disparity between locally delivered graduate programmes. Lack of funding to provide a well-structured programme and the impact on the recruitment and retention of new nurses.
Twenty-five nurses participated, with 31 positions succeeded to. Nurses reported positively that the programme was beneficial, increased their sense of career planning and gave them a greater understanding of their career pathway.
Developing innovative and effective curricula to meet the needs of post graduate students from varied backgrounds preparing to practice in different contexts with different client groups is challenging. However, the development of individual learning pathways and work-based learning ensures that the student's work and intended advanced practice role remains at the centre of their learning. Analysis of each student's knowledge and skill deficits alongside an analysis of the organization's readiness to support them as qualified advanced practitioners (APs) is instrumental in ensuring that organizations are ready to support practitioners in new roles.
The nature of night nursing is changing; expanded roles and responsibilities are common. However, CPD remains problematic, as a result of constraints around time and access. Context-specific issues shape the nature of night working in acute and community settings and should be considered when planning CPD.
The findings report: * The qualifications that non-medical prescribers possess. * The level of confidence described by the non-medical prescribers in their role. * What non-medical prescribers identify as their present and future CPD requirements in relation to prescribing. * What education and training provision non-medical prescribers have attended in relation to their prescribing role since qualifying.
Eighty-five per cent (143/168) of Directors of Nursing, from all 10 English Strategic Health Authorities, responded. Forty-six per cent (n = 66) of Trusts had introduced assistant practitioners and 22% (n = 31) were planning to implement the role before 2009. There is wide variation in assistant practitioner numbers across and between Strategic Health Authorities, Trusts and clinical areas. Resistance to the role existed in 32% (n = 46) of Trusts. Reasons for resistance included no perceived need for the role, lack of evidence of effectiveness, financial constraints and professional and patient safety concerns.
Key findings were as follows: there was widespread support for the development of these roles, they are perceived to have a positive impact on patient care; however, the need for support was recognized to ensure the continuation of such roles. Securing funding was problematic and this was influential on the kind of new roles that were developed.
A multi-group SEM analysis indicated a good fit of the hypothesized model. Work engagement significantly mediated the empowerment/effectiveness relationship in both groups, although the impact of engagement on work effectiveness was significantly stronger for experienced nurses.
Evaluation is currently in relation to each of the 15 modules rather than as the programme as a whole. It uses various methods including audit, observation, activity follow through, satisfaction surveys and process mapping. Each month data is colated for each of the 11 metrics which has shown a reduction in falls, drug administration errors and improvement in the recording of patient observations.
One of the key issues is that an essential component for the success of the programme lies in the tangible support of the Trust Board/Board of Directors. Evidence shows that this programme improves patient satisfaction as it enables the provision of an increase in direct patient care by staff and subsequently improved clinical and safety outcomes. Ward Sister/Charge Nurse development includes Leadership, Project management and Lean Methodology techniques.
There have been numerous publications in the past 2 years regarding routine dosing of PDE5I for three major urological indications; penile rehabilitation, stuttering priapism, and management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Evidence from basic science investigations has indicated that daily dose PDE5I may improve erectile function and exert a number of beneficial tissue effects on the penis. Unfortunately, data from human series of routine dose PDE5I for penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy are conflicting, with the two largest studies showing no benefit to daily dose therapy in the post-radical prostatectomy and the general ED populations. PDE5I are generally helpful at reducing symptoms of LUTS, particularly when given in conjunction with alpha blockers. Routine dosing of PDE5I has also been utilized successfully for management of stuttering ischemic priapism and several other medical indications.
Of the four experts discussing the topic, the first who is the section editor of the Controversy section, believes that NPT/Rigiscan cannot be considered a useful diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis in ED. He is supported by the physiological considerations of the second expert and by the experimental evidence produced and discussed by the expert number four who questions the accuracy, reliability, and usefulness of these tools to measure a critical aspect of the erection physiology which is the adequate rigidity. In contrast, with several good arguments, the third expert still suggests the use of these tools, perhaps not for every man presenting with ED, but at least for the patient with no neurovascular risk factors who presents with a history suggestive of a psychogenic cause.
A dose-response relationship was observed for the relationship between baseline severity of LUTS and severity of ED at follow-up with those who had more severe LUTS at baseline with an increased odds of having more severe ED (odd ratio [OR] = 1.86, confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-2.97 for mild LUTS at baseline; OR = 2.95, CI: 1.81-4.81 for moderate LUTS at baseline; and OR = 3.82, CI: 2.00-7.27 for severe LUTS at baseline). Other baseline factors that were statistically significantly associated with ED included body mass index (OR = 1.13, CI: 1.01-1.26), hypertension (OR = 1.30, CI: 1.02-1.65) and diabetes (OR = 1.44, CI: 1.07-1.93).
The IMS prescription review showed that: two million testosterone prescriptions were written for women in 2006 and 2007--many physicians have prescribed compounded testosterone. Based on a summary of the physicians' survey: on average, patients of all ages, but particularly menopausal women, have at least moderate awareness of HSDD. More than 80% of physicians believe there is a need or great need for a Food and Drug Administration- (FDA) approved HSDD treatment. Ninety percent of physicians surveyed would prescribe an approved HSDD product over currently prescribed therapy.
Both FK- and RAP-treated rats had preserved EF compared with vehicle-treated rats after BCNI. FKBPs changed variably following injury and treatment. In particular, in the penis at Day 1, FKBP 38 expression was decreased after BCNI and both FK and RAP attenuated this decrease. In MPG at Day 1, FKBP 38 expression was also decreased after BCNI and FK attenuated the decrease, while at Day 7, FKBP 38 expression was still decreased and RAP attenuated the decrease. Also, in the penis at Day 1, FKBP 65 expression decreased after BCNI and FK attenuated the decrease. In the MPG, FKBP 65 expression increased at both Days 1 and 7 with FK treatment.
For both solo and partnered sexual activities, the prevalence of men who had incorporated a vibrator into sexual activities during their lives was 44.8%, with 10.0% having done so in the past month, 14.2% in the past year, and 20.5% over 1 year ago. Men who had used vibrators, particularly those with more recent use, were more likely to report participation in sexual health promoting behaviors, such as testicular self-exam. Men who had used vibrators recently also scored higher on four of the five domains of the International Index of Erectile Function (erectile function, intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function, and sexual desire).
The mean age of the women at first exposure to testosterone therapy was 49.1 +/- 8.2 years, median treatment duration, 1.3 years, and mean follow-up of 6.7 +/- 4.6 years, providing 4,015 woman-years of follow-up. Twelve cases of invasive breast cancer occurred among 599 women breast cancer-free before treatment, giving an age adjusted IRR of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 0.76-2.38). There was no evidence of an independent effect of duration of exposure on breast cancer risk.
There were associations between self-reported victimization through coerced anal and vaginal sex (P &lt; 0.001), psychological (P &lt; 0.001), and physical aggression (P &lt; 0.001). Those reporting to have been forced into anal intercourse cited higher rates of paranoid and psychotic features, jealousy, attribution of problems to one's own behavior, conflict, and male dominance, as well as lower expectations of improvement in one's marital relationship.
Number of risk factors was significantly associated with postoperative change in IIEF-5 score (P = 0.02). A post hoc analysis of the association revealed that patients with one risk factor were significantly more likely to have increased IIEF-5 scores (N = 18), whereas those with two or more risk factors were significantly more likely to have decreased IIEF-5 scores (N = 21, P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, those with no risk factors were significantly more likely to be stable (N = 8) compared with those with more than two risk factors, who were more likely to have decreased scores (P &lt; 0.05). The hierarchical logistic regression results showed that when examining all risk factors simultaneously, because of multicollinearity, only hyperlipidemia was significantly associated with postoperative ED (odds ratio [OR] = 11.33, confidence interval [CI] = 1.25, 102.82). Frequency of intercourse was also significantly associated with postoperative ED after controlling for risk factors (OR = 0.71, CI = 0.52, 0.97).
The prevalence of women's vibrator use was found to be 52.5% (95% CI 50.3-54.7%). Vibrator users were significantly more likely to have had a gynecologic exam during the past year (P &lt; 0.001) and to have performed genital self-examination during the previous month (P &lt; 0.001). Vibrator use was significantly related to several aspects of sexual function (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, overall function) with recent vibrator users scoring higher on most sexual function domains, indicating more positive sexual function. Most women (71.5%) reported having never experienced genital symptoms associated with vibrator use. There were no significant associations between vibrator use and participants' scores on the CDC Healthy Days Measures.
Following treatment, participants had significantly higher vestibular pain thresholds and significantly lower pain ratings during the gynecological examination. Participants reported significant reductions in pain intensity during intercourse and were able to engage in significantly more pain-free activities. Although overall sexual function significantly improved, various components of sexual function and frequency of intercourse did not. Participants' mental health did not significantly improve; however, pain catastrophizing and pain-related anxiety significantly decreased. The treatment was considered to be successful for 10 of the 13 participants, and predictors of greater treatment success included greater reductions in helplessness and a longer period of time in treatment.
For both sexes, multivariate analyses revealed that PVI frequency was directly associated with all satisfaction measures (part correlation = 0.50 with sexual satisfaction), masturbation frequency was independently inversely associated with almost all satisfaction measures, and noncoital sex frequencies independently inversely associated with some satisfaction measures (and uncorrelated with the rest). Age did not confound the results.
After control for potential confounders, men with either a high WC or an obese BMI had an approximately 50% higher odds of having ED compared with men with a low WC or a normal BMI, respectively. Further, moderately active or inactive men had an approximately 40-60% greater odds of ED compared with active men. When all three predictors (WC, BMI, and physical activity level) were entered into the same logistic regression model, both a high WC and low physical activity level (moderately active and inactive) were independently associated with a greater odds of ED, whereas BMI level was not.
Based upon pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, once-daily doses of tadalafil 5 mg were predicted to provide therapeutic concentrations that would be maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. Additionally, for a subgroup of men who anticipate at least twice-weekly sexual activity and are currently taking tadalafil 20 mg, a reduction in daily tadalafil exposure was predicted. To support the hypothesis that low-dose, once-daily tadalafil may be a safe and effective treatment alternative, clinical trials were conducted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tadalafil 2.5 and 5 mg. These results were similar to those of historical as-needed studies evaluating tadalafil 10 and 20 mg.
Significant correlations were observed between ICP and ICP/BP in both young (r(2) = 0.886) and old (r(2) = 0.962) rats. If the ratio ICP/BP was taken as a metric of VPE and non-erection, then the threshold value for observing a VPE in the majority of animals was &gt; or =0.5 in both young and old rats. However, higher current stimulation was required in the old than in the young animals to achieve erections. Moreover, both the maximal ICP and ICP/BP ratios achieved during erection were also lower in the old (85 +/- 2 cmH(2)O and 0.6 +/- 0.02, respectively) than young (106 +/- 3 cmH(2)O and 0.75 +/- 0.02, respectively) rats (P &lt; 0.0001).
In the entire study sample, serum free testosterone levels correlated negatively with both BDI and HDRS scores. In the hypogonadism group (based on free testosterone, 19.8% of the sample), clinically significant depression (BDI score &gt; or = 13) was more than three times as frequent as in the other men (34.8% vs. 10.4%), the odds ratio after multiple adjustments being 4.98 (95% confidence interval 1.66-14.95). A decrease in sexual desire was common in hypogonadism (36%). Nevertheless, it also associated with clinically significant depression, irrespective of free testosterone levels.
A higher proportion of TGCC patients than comparators were likely to report low sexual desire (odds ratio [OR] 6.7 [95% confidence interval {CI} 2.1-21]) as well as erectile dysfunction (OR 3.8 [95% CI 1.4-10]). No significant differences were observed regarding erectile dysfunctional distress, change of desire over time, interest in sex, premature or delayed ejaculation, time since last intercourse, need for or receiving sexual advice, or sexual satisfaction. Hypogonadism did not predict erectile dysfunction (OR 1.1 [95% CI 0.26-4.5]) or low sexual desire (OR 1.2 [95% CI 0.11-14]). Treatment modality had no obvious impact on sexual function.
Emotional intelligence was not associated with the potential confounders of age and years of education, nor did we find a significant association between emotional intelligence and potential risk factors for FOD such as age, body mass index, physical or sexual abuse, or menopause. We found emotional intelligence to be positively correlated with both frequency of orgasm during intercourse (r = 0.13, P &lt; 0.001) and masturbation (r = 0.23, P &lt; 0.001). Women in the lowest quartile of emotional intelligence had an approximate twofold increased risk of infrequent orgasm (Intercourse = odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9; Masturbation = [OR] 1.8, [CI] 1.3-2.5).
ED was present in 34%, OD in 20%, and DL in 55%. When correlated with overall sexual satisfaction, ED had the highest weighted kappa (0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-0.87), while OD (0.57, 95% CI = 0.51-0.63) and DL (0.55, 95%CI = 0.48-0.62) were considerably lower. Furthermore, the single item assessing confidence in getting and keeping an erection had the strongest correlation with overall sexual bother as well as specific erectile bother.
NaHS produced significant concentration-dependent relaxation of vaginal and cavernosal smooth muscles with inhibitions by combination of ODQ and MDL 12,330A (26.4%), N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (22.2%), high K(+) (15.1%) or glibenclamide (10.1%). Based on molar potency, NaHS was 18.3 and 6.3 times weaker than nitroglycerine and sildenafil, respectively. Quantitative assays indicated that plasma H(2)S level was 16.5 +/- 2.58 microM, and H(2)S was synthesized in the clitoral and vaginal smooth muscles (1.8 and 3.9 nmol/mg soluble protein compared with 26.5 nmol/mg in the liver: positive control). Similarly, western blotting identified the protein expression bands of CSE (44.5 kDa) and CBS (63 kDa) in these genital tissue samples.
Within 2 months of PDE5i preventive strategy, priapism recurrences nearly resolved. At 6 months, prophylaxis was discontinued. At 12 months, the patient reported clear improvement and satisfaction, experiencing rare episodes of priapism and a physiologic erectile function.
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to examine the relationship between the presence or absence of ED and PVD, and mortality in a HF population. Although not statistically significant, a trend for increased risk of death was demonstrated in the ischemic cardiomyopathy cohort with ED.
The reservoirs had immediately ruptured into the bladder upon refilling, and were identified intravesically on cystoscopy and computed tomography scan. A one-step approach can be done to salvage the device, remove the eroded reservoir with bladder repair, and new reservoir placed directly into appropriate space. Interpretation. During IPP revision, even when a reservoir is not manipulated simple tubing repair performed, gross hematuria in the recovery room likely signals bladder perforation. We include recommendations for reservoir management with implant revision, as well as surgical management and prevention of this complication.
Erectile function was significantly lower in hypercholesterolemic mice than in controls. DPO-based multiplex PCR revealed a profound decrease in the gene expression of endothelium-specific cell-to-cell junction proteins, including claudin-5, VE-cadherin, and PECAM-1, in hypercholesterolemic mice compared with that in controls. The expression of claudin-5, VE-cadherin, and PECAM-1 protein evaluated by Western blot or immunohistochemistry was significantly lower in hypercholesterolemic mice than in controls. These endothelial cell-to-cell junction proteins were more sparsely distributed in the endothelium of cavernous sinusoids than in the endothelium of cavernous artery and dorsal blood vessels.
The prostate showed adequate irradiation with fibrosis occurring at 9 weeks after irradiation. The corpora cavernosa showed arteries that had developed loss of smooth muscle cells expressing SMA, thickening of the intima, and occlusions. All the control rats maintained normal anatomy.
Although the standard EEG waveform analyses enable millisecond time-resolution information about the human sexual responses in the brain, less is clear about their related spatial information. Nowadays, the improvement of EEG techniques and statistical approaches allows the visualization of the dynamics of the human sexual response with a higher spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we describe these enhanced techniques and summarize along with an overview of what we have learned from them in terms of chronoarchitecture of sexual response in the human brain. Finally, the speculation on how we may be able to use other enhanced approaches, such as independent component analysis, are also presented.
Three hundred-one physicians from 41 countries completed the questionnaire (82% were urologists). Sixty-five percent of the responders had formal sexual medicine specialty training, 44% had uro-oncology specialty training, and 60% performed RPs. Eighty-seven percent performed some form of rehabilitation. As part of the primary rehabilitation strategy, 95% used phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5), 30% used vacuum device, 75% used intracavernosal injections, and 9.9% used intraurethral prostaglandin. Fifty-four percent commenced rehabilitation immediately/just after urethral catheter removal, and 37% within the first 4 months after RP. Neither the number of years in medical practice, clinician age, nor country/region of practice differed between rehabilitation performers and non-performers. With regard to the primary reason for avoiding rehabilitation: 50% responded said it is the cost; 25% said the fact that it is not evidence-based; and 25% said they were not familiar with the concept. Performing rehabilitation was positively associated with urologic oncology training (P = 0.03), performing RP (P &lt; 0.001), and seeing over 50 post-RP patients per year (P = 0.011).
Olfactory testing revealed that 38 patients were functionally anosmic, 39 patients were hyposmic, and nine patients were normosmic. The average BDI score was 11.0 +/- 8.4 points. Evaluation of the SAI questionnaire revealed a significant decrease (P = 0.003) of the score from 22.7 +/- 4.5 points from the time before to 21.4 +/- 4.9 points since the onset of olfactory loss. No significant correlation was found between olfactory function and the SAI since the onset of olfactory dysfunction. However, the BDI score correlated negatively with the SAI since the onset of olfactory dysfunction (r(85) = -0.36; P = 0.001).
Of the subjects with questionnaire completed, 83.9% (708/844) had ED. Among the subjects with different severity of ED, the moderate group had the highest percentages regarding prevalence of being bothered (89.4%), having interest in treatment (78.5%), and having sought treatment (46.2%). Of all the subjects, only 14.2% had ever visited Western physicians, whereas embarrassment and misinformation about ED treatment were the leading reasons for never doing so. Over half (56.6%) of those with ED wished to discuss ED problem with their doctors, and of them 90.4% wished the doctors to initiate to broach this issue.
Cosmetic and functional outcome were acceptable. Pathology examination revealed features of foreign body granuloma.
Twenty-one computed tomography arthrograms from 20 dogs were included. At surgery, damage to the medial meniscus was identified in 14 stifles. Initial interpretation of computed tomography arthrography images was 57 to 64 per cent sensitive and 71 to 100 per cent specific for diagnosing medial meniscal injuries. Interpretation of the images on retrospective analysis was 71 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific, with an accuracy of 0.857.
Ten dogs with segmental caudal vena cava aplasia were identified. In all dogs, postrenal caval blood was shunted to either a right or a left azygos vein, with seven different angiographic patterns. Affected dogs were predominantly female (70 per cent) and young (mean 2.6 years). Additional portocaval and porto-azygos shunt vessels were identified in two cases each. Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography depicted details of abdominal vessels including thrombus formation in one dog.
The body temperature of dogs wrapped with the Sirius rescue sheet increased intraoperatively. In dogs just lying on warmed gel pads, a decrease in mean body temperature was revealed and mean body temperatures differed between groups after 40 minutes. Extent of heat loss from the gel pads did not differ between the groups.
Overall computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging performed very similarly. However, lysis of bones bordering the nasal cavity and mucosal thickening was found on computed tomography images more often than on magnetic resonance images. Small amounts of fluid in the nasal cavity were more often seen on magnetic resonance images. However, fluid in the frontal sinuses was seen equally well with both modalities.
From May 2002 to August 2007, 398 patients underwent an attempt at VATS lobectomy and 343 underwent thoracotomy. An "intent-to-treat" analysis was performed. There was 1 postoperative death in each group. Survival by Cox model was no different for VATS versus thoracotomy (hazard ratio 0.72; P = .12), whereas age (hazard ratio 1.03; P &lt; .001), larger tumor size (hazard ratio 1.34; P &lt; .001), and higher nodal stage (hazard ratio 1.92; P &lt; .001) were associated with worse survival. Logistic regression demonstrated fewer complications for VATS lobectomy (odds ratio 0.73; P = .06), whereas age (odds ratio 1.04; P &lt; .001) and tumor size (odds ratio 1.2; P &lt; .020) correlated with a greater number of complications. Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy demonstrated a 2-day shorter length of stay than patients undergoing thoracotomy (P &lt; .001). Propensity score-matched analysis supported these findings.
There were 84 patients (39 men and 45 women) with a median age of 57 years (range, 34-83 years). Forty-six patients were symptomatic. Surgical resection included pulmonary wedge excision in 62 patients, lobectomy in 4 patients, segmentectomy in 2 patients, chest wall resection in 3 patients, isolated pleural resection in 7 patients, and chest wall resection with pulmonary wedge excision, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy in 3, 2, and 1 patients, respectively. Tumors were polypoid in 57 patients, sessile in 20 patients, and intrapulmonary in 7 patients. Histopathology was benign in 73 and malignant in 11 patients. Nine (82%) patient with malignant tumors and 37 (54%) patients with benign tumors were symptomatic (P = .11). The median tumor diameters for malignant and benign tumors were 12.0 and 4.5 cm, respectively (P = .001). Operative mortality and morbidity occurred in 3 (3.6%) and 7 (8.1%) patients, respectively. Median follow-up in survivors was 146 months (range, 23-387 months). Median survival for patients with benign and malignant tumors was 284 and 55 months, respectively, and 5-year survival was 88.9% and 45.5%, respectively (P = .0005). Eight (9.5%) patients had recurrent solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura. Recurrences were malignant in 6 and benign in 2 patients. Localized chest recurrences occurred in 3 patients, all of whom had reresection, with 2 patients again having recurrence.
During the period 1995-2006, 120 patients with thymic tumors underwent surgical intervention, including 23 patients with thymic carcinoma and 97 patients with thymoma, as classified according to the World Health Organization 2004 histologic classification. The overall 5-year survival was significantly different between patients with thymic carcinoma and those with thymoma (thymic carcinoma, 53%; thymoma, 89%; P = .01). Data on relapse were available for 112 patients. The progression-free 5-year survival was also significantly different between patients with thymic carcinoma and those with thymoma (thymic carcinoma, 36%; thymoma, 75%; P &lt; .01). Using multivariate analysis, thymic carcinoma and incomplete resection were found to be independent predictors of progression-free survival. Relapses in patients with thymic carcinoma tended to occur earlier, and occurred significantly more frequently at distant sites than in patients with thymoma (60% vs 13%, P = .01).
There was no mortality during the study period. Weight gain was appropriate in all animals. Daily bronchoscopy and postmortem histologic evaluation confirmed excellent viability of the neotrachea. There was no evidence of suture-line dehiscence. Five animals had distal granulomas that were removed by using rigid bronchoscopy. In group III 1 animal had tracheomalacia, which was successfully managed by means of insertion of a silicon stent.
Eight of 14 patients who underwent complete resection had a second recurrence after a mean free interval of 20 +/- 9 months, and a new complete resection was reperformed in 4. After incomplete resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy allowed total remission in 4 subjects and only 1 of these had a second recurrence. Survival after surgery of the recurrence was negatively influenced by incomplete recurrence resection (P = .03), first disease-free interval less than 24 months (P = .03), high p53 (P = .04), low p21 (P = .02), low p27 (P = .003) expressions, and combination of these proteins (p53 high, p21 low, p27 low expression) (P = .0001). Multivariate analysis selected the triple combination of cell-cycle protein expression as the most significant prognostic variable (P = .02, odds ratio = 11.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.39-102.63).
Average time of operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was 417, 130, and 36 minutes, respectively. A total of 124 cervical stent grafts were inserted and successfully delivered in 121 (97.6%). Operative mortality within 30 days was 3 (4.3%). The major postoperative complications involved 4 (5.8%) strokes and 2 (2.9%) spinal cord injuries. No aorta-related death was observed after discharge from hospital, and the survival was 90.9%, 88.8%, and 88.8% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Six (5.0%) cervical stent grafts showed endoleak; however, all these cases were successfully treated by additional endovascular repair.
In normally functioning grafts, the mean diastolic and mean blood flow improved significantly during 1:1 intra-aortic balloon pump use compared with during intra-aortic balloon pump cessation (P &lt; .001), although mean and diastolic arterial pressures were significantly lower (P = .001). Arterial and sequential saphenous vein grafts showed greater improvements in mean diastolic and mean flow compared with single venous grafts. Surplus graft flow (defined as mean flow during 1:1 intra-aortic balloon pump use/mean flow with intra-aortic balloon pump off) was recorded (surplus graft flow &gt; 1) during 1:1 intra-aortic balloon pump use in all normally functioning grafts, with higher values in single arterial or sequential saphenous vein grafts versus single venous grafts (both P &lt; .001). In the 9 cases of graft failure, the mean diastolic, mean systolic, and mean flow were significantly lower and the pulsatility index greater, compared with normally functioning grafts (all P &lt;or= .001). Blood flow did not change appreciably during 1:1 intra-aortic balloon pump use in failed bypass grafts; thus the surplus graft flow approached 1.
Twenty (25.3%) patients died within 30 days following coronary artery bypass surgery. Survivors (n = 59) showed a larger extent of viable myocardium (6.9 +/- 3.6 viable segments vs 3.4 +/- 3.3 viable segments, P &lt; .001) and smaller left ventricular dyssynchrony (75 +/- 5 ms vs 179 +/- 83 ms, P &lt; .001) than nonsurvivors. The presence of significant dyssynchrony (&gt;or=105 ms) and absence of myocardial viability (&lt;5 viable segments) independently predicted 30-day mortality with hazard ratio 3.26, 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 8.33 (P &lt; .01) and hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 1.89 (P &lt; .01), respectively. All but 2 patients (94.1%) with viable myocardium and without left ventricular dyssynchrony survived coronary artery bypass surgery as compared with only 12 (52.2%) patients with nonviable myocardium and severe dyssynchrony (P &lt; .001).
There were 14 (15.6%) in-hospital deaths and 29 (32.2%) late deaths. Overall survival at 5, 7, and 10 years was 68% +/- 5%, 59% +/- 6%, and 49% +/- 6%, respectively, and was reduced in those undergoing operations for prosthetic compared with native endocarditis (7-year survival, 39% +/- 9% vs 71% +/- 7%; P &lt; .001). Freedom from recurrent endocarditis was 84% +/- 5% at 10 years. Freedom from reoperation was 91% +/- 4% at 10 years. Event-free survival at 7 and 10 years was 60% +/- 6% and 47% +/- 7%, respectively. No difference was observed between the native and prosthetic groups for recurrent endocarditis, late reoperation, or event-free survival. Prosthetic endocarditis, increasing age, preoperative shock, and diabetes mellitus were independent predictors of death from all causes.
The early patency rate was significantly higher in group I than in group II (98.3% vs 94.5%; P = .004). The 1-, 2-, and 5-year patency rates were also higher in group I than in group II (93.8% +/- 1.2%, 90.5% +/- 1.6%, and 74.3% +/- 6.1%, vs 90.5% +/- 1.4%, 85.3% +/- 1.9%, and 65.2% +/- 4.2%, respectively; P = .004). Multivariate analysis showed composite grafting (P = .02), the degree of target vessel stenosis &lt;90% (P = .001), and the target revascularization site (P = .005) to be significant risk factors for occlusion.
Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation was feasible in all 12 patients, with no procedural complications (procedure time 99 +/- 16 minutes, fluoroscopy time 21 +/- 6 minutes). Right ventricular outflow tract gradient during catheterization and pulmonary regurgitant fraction on magnetic resonance imaging fell after valve implantation (gradient 34 +/- 6 to 14 +/- 3 mm Hg, P &lt; .01, regurgitant fraction 20% +/- 6% to 2% +/- 1%, P &lt; .05). After restoration of right ventricular outflow tract function, indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased (91 +/- 13 to 78 +/- 12 mL x beat(-1) x m(-2), P &lt; .01) and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance improved (peak oxygen consumption 25.4 +/- 2.3 to 30.8 +/- 3.0 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1), P &lt; .01). During follow-up (18.8 +/- 4.6 months), there was 1 device explantation (restenosis). The probabilities of freedom from right ventricular outflow tract reoperation were 100% at 1 year and 90% at 3 years.
Twenty-three patients (68%) were in sinus rhythm. Holter monitoring demonstrated normal mean heart rate, low maximal heart rate, and no clinically significant arrhythmias or sinus node dysfunction. With maximal bicycle ergometry (n = 19), maximum workload (60% of normal), maximum heart rate (90% of normal), and maximal oxygen uptake (69% of normal) were all significantly lower in the Fontan group than in a control group (P &lt; .001). Variables of submaximal exercise indicated less efficient oxygen uptake during exercise in all Fontan patients. Ejection fraction was lower than in control subjects (59% +/- 13% vs 69% +/- 5%, P &lt; .001). Mean end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ventricular mass were higher than in control subjects (P &lt; .001). Mean NT-pro-BNP levels were increased relative to reference values, but only 8 patients had levels above the upper reference limit.
Total caval flow was 2.9 +/- 1.0 L x min(-1) x m(-2), with an inferior vena cava contribution of 59% +/- 15%. Total pulmonary flow was 2.5 +/- 0.8 L x min(-1) x m(-2), statistically less than caval flow and not explained by fenestration presence. The right pulmonary artery contribution (55% +/- 13%) was statistically greater than the left. In patients with bilateral superior cavae, the right cava accounted for 52% +/- 14% of the flow, with no difference in pulmonary flow splits (50% +/- 16% to the right). Age and body surface area correlated with percent inferior caval contribution (r = 0.60 and 0.74, respectively). Superior vena cava anastomosis and Fontan type did not significantly affect pulmonary flow splits.
As determined by using univariate analysis, male patients had a shorter interval than female patients (median, 16 vs 26 years; P = .01), and African American patients had a shorter interval than white patients (median, 16 vs 25 years; P = .049). A significant correlation was also identified between age at the time of pulmonary valve disruption and the subsequent interval to pulmonary valve replacement. Overall, the interval tended to increase as age at disruption increased (P &lt; .0001). Although the presence of branch pulmonary artery stenosis determined by the need for concomitant pulmonary arterioplasty was associated with a significantly shorter interval to pulmonary valve replacement (21 vs 24 years, P = .02), stenosis determined based on small branch pulmonary artery diameter was correlated to a prolonged interval to pulmonary valve replacement (P = .009). Initial diagnosis, prior palliative shunt operation, and degree of pulmonary regurgitation had no effect on the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and subsequent pulmonary valve replacement. As determined by using multivariate analysis, only male sex and small pulmonary artery diameter remained significant factors.
One hundred fourteen patients with 60 (52.6%) paroxysmal, 32 (28.1%) persistent, and 22 (19.3%) long-standing persistent atrial fibrillations were treated. The mean age was 59.5 +/- 10.6 years, and 69.3% were men. The mean follow-up period was 204 +/- 41 days (median 195). There were 2 (1.8%) operative mortalities. At 6-month follow-up, with long-term monitoring, 52/60 (86.7%) patients with paroxysmal fibrillations were in normal sinus rhythm and 43/60 (71.7%) were both in normal sinus rhythm and off antiarrhythmic drugs. The patients with persistent atrial fibrillation had a lower success rate, with 18/32 (56.3%) being in normal sinus rhythm and 46.9% both in normal sinus rhythm and off antiarrhythmic drugs; for long-standing persistent cases, 11/22 (50%) were in normal sinus rhythm and 7/22 (31.9%) were also off antiarrhythmic drugs.
Procedural success was 98.3%. Nine patients died within 30 days, yielding an overall early mortality of 5.0%. For in-hospital outcome, multivariate analysis showed that age greater than 75 years (odds ratio [OR] 4,9; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.6-15.1; P = .006), American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than III (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.0-7.5; P = .04), and emergency status (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.3-8.9; P = .01) were independent predictors of major adverse events. Compared with electively treated patients, emergency status was associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital mortality (13.5% vs 2.1%; P = .003) and neurologic events (16.2% vs 4.2%; P = .01). However, patients with acute dissection had a smaller baseline diameter and were less often identified to have secondary endoleaks and progressive enlargement. Average follow-up for hospital survivors was 22.3 +/- 17.0 months with an estimated survival of 94.9% +/- 1.7% at 30 days, 90.6% +/- 2.3% at 12 months, 90.6% +/- 2.3% at 24 months, and 81.8% +/- 4.8 % at 36 months. During follow-up, 30 patients required a total of 32 secondary interventions including 12 open and 20 endovascular procedures, accounting for an estimated 71.5% freedom from reinterventions at 36 months. Follow-up imaging revealed stable or decreasing thoracic aortic diameter in 80.5% of patients.
One hundred eighty-three patients received matched grafts that were angiographically assessed at 9 months. The 9-month graft patency was 82.0% (150/183) for hand-sewn and 80.3% (147/183) for PAS-Port grafts. The patency rate of PAS-Port anastomoses was statistically noninferior to that of hand-sewn anastomoses (95% lower confidence limit for difference, -7.95%). The freedom from major adverse cardiac events at 9 months was 97.7% for PAS-Port (95% confidence interval, 94.5%-99.0%) and 98.2% for hand-sewn (95% confidence interval, 95.1%-99.3%) grafts. The PAS-port device was associated with a 4.6 +/- 3.9-minute reduction in anastomotic time compared with that seen with a hand-sewn anastomosis (P &lt; .001).
The peak absorbance and emission of methylene blue as a near-infrared fluorophore occur at 667 nm and 686 nm, respectively. After intravenous injection, methylene blue provides highly sensitive coronary angiography. A lipophilic cation, methylene blue is extracted rapidly into tissue, with myocardium displaying unusually high uptake. Methylene blue permits real-time visualization and quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion. Because of absent spectral overlap, use of 2 independent fluorophores in our imaging system permits simultaneous quantification of perfusion, venous drainage, and/or intravascular thrombi.
Ischemic injury impaired function in both cardiomyocytes and whole hearts. Isolated cells showed significant reduction in peak shortening and departure and relaxation velocities. Whole hearts displayed severely reduced developed pressures. Hyposmotic solution forced cardiomyocytes to swell to 7% greater than their normal size. No significant effect on shortening was seen. Similarly, Langendorff-perfused hearts were induced to take on 3% more water than control-perfused hearts and 9% more water than nonperfused hearts. This additional water was associated with mild dysfunction.
Steady-state systolic and preload-independent parameters were superior for atrial synchronous biventricular and left ventricular pacing and atrial-only pacing relative to atrial synchronous right ventricular outflow tract pacing (P &lt; .05). Diastolic parameters, excepting maximum negative rate of left ventricular pressure change, were unaffected. No significant differences were observed between atrial synchronous biventricular and left ventricular pacing and atrial-only pacing. Systolic dyssynchrony was significantly lower for atrial synchronous biventricular pacing (21% +/- 5%), atrial synchronous left ventricular pacing (20% +/- 6%), and atrial-only pacing (20% +/- 6%) versus atrial synchronous right ventricular outflow tract pacing (25% +/- 7%, P &lt; .05). Atrioventricular interval during atrial-only stimulation was positively correlated with difference in stroke work between atrial synchronous biventricular pacing and atrial-only pacing (r(2) = 0.78, P &gt; .001).
The amount of air embolism as observed on echocardiography and the number of microembolic signals as recorded by transcranial Doppler were significantly less in the study group during the de-airing time (P &lt; .001) and the first 10 minutes after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass (P &lt; .001). Further, the de-airing time was significantly shorter in the study group (10 vs 17 minutes, P &lt; .001).
17beta-estradiol significantly increased mesenchymal stem cell vascular endothelial growth factor production in a dose-dependent manner. Both estrogen receptor-alpha and estrogen receptor-beta were expressed in mesenchymal stem cells. Administration of 17beta-estradiol or estrogen receptor-alpha agonist (not estrogen receptor-beta agonist) elevated mesenchymal stem cell vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha expression, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. However, these effects were neutralized in estrogen receptor-alpha knockout mesenchymal stem cells, not estrogen receptor-beta knockout. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 knockout abolished estrogen receptor-alpha-induced hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha and subsequent vascular endothelial growth factor production.
Right ventricular preload-recruitable-stroke-work, contractility, and ejection fraction were lower at 75% and 100% left ventricular unloading in sham compared with infarcted animals (75%: 26.3 +/- 3.4, 0.70 +/- 0.15, and 23.9 +/- 4.6 vs 37 +/- 2.6 erg *10;3, 0.99 +/- 0.18 mm Hg/mL, and 35.5% +/- 3.4%, all P &lt; . 01, 100%: 24.8 +/- 4.5, 0.67 +/- 0.14, and 23.8 +/- 5.8 vs 36.0 +/- 4.6 erg *10;3, 0.90 +/- 0.09 mm Hg/mL, and 32.7% +/- 11.0%, all P &lt; . 01). Central venous pressure was higher at 75% and 100% unloading in sham compared with infarcted animals (75%: 8.6 +/- 1.0 vs 4.5 +/- 1.0, 100%: 12.4 +/- 0.8 vs 3.4 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, all P &lt; . 01). Right ventricular cardiac output was less in shams with 100% unloading (1.2 +/- 0.2 L/min vs 2.1 +/- 0.3 L/min, P &lt; . 01). End-diastolic and end-systolic right ventricular short-axis dimension at 75% and 100% unloading was greater in sham compared with infarcted animals (75%: 34.4 +/- 5.5 mm and 29.1 +/- 5.5 mm vs 25.6 +/- 4.7 mm and 20.5 +/- 4.0 mm; 100%: 37.6 +/- 6.6 mm and 29.9 +/- 5.9 mm vs 25.5 +/- 3.9 mm and 21.1 +/- 3.8 mm, all P &lt; .01). Prolonged diastolic relaxation (Tau) in infarcted animals was normalized with 75% and 100% unloading.
Patients who received bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography had higher diagnostic yields of acid-fast bacilli smears (31.5% vs 12.5%, P = .018) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, M tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (67.1% vs 47.9%, P = .024), and pathologic reports of tuberculosis in transbronchial lung biopsy specimens (32.9% vs 4.2%, P &lt; .0001) than patients who received conventional bronchoscopy. With the aid of endobronchial ultrasonography, the overall diagnostic yield for tuberculosis by using bronchoscopic procedures (smears and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and transbronchial lung biopsy specimens) was higher (80.8%) than for those who did not undergo endobronchial ultrasonography (58.3%, P = .035).
Length of hospitalization (10 vs 6 days; P = .04) and weight gain (5 vs 2.5 kg; P = .001) were significantly greater for patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. The serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor were significantly elevated in patients with diabetes when compared with patients without diabetes before versus 6 hours post-cardiopulmonary bypass/cardioplegic arrest. In addition, significantly elevated mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein, and E1A binding protein p300 (more than twofold) was observed 4 days post-cardiopulmonary bypass/cardioplegic arrest exclusively in patients with diabetes.
There were no statistical differences in sex, age, body height, body weight, body mass index, or the presence of blebs/bullae on computed tomography scans of the lung or under thoracoscopy between the 2 groups. In the smoking group, patients had more extensive respiratory bronchiolitis (P &lt; .001), a high prevalence of tobacco pigmentation (P &lt; .001), and a higher recurrence rate without or after surgery than the nonsmoking group (57% vs 22%, P = .001 and 8.9% vs 1.7%, P = .02, respectively). Patients with extensive respiratory bronchiolitis had significantly higher nonoperative and postoperative recurrences than patients with nonextensive respiratory bronchiolitis (P = .004 and P &lt; .001, respectively).
Aortic stenosis was present in 23 patients (mean age, 78 years) and was absent in 7 patients (mean age, 72 years). Aortic valve calcification scores were 3.5 +/- 0.6 and 1.3 +/- 0.5 in patients with and without aortic stenosis, respectively (P &lt; .001). Patients with no or mild aortic valve calcification had lower osteopontin levels compared with patients with moderate or severe aortic valve calcification (406.1 +/- 165.8 vs 629.5 +/- 227.5 ng/mL, P = .01). Similarly, patients with aortic stenosis had higher osteopontin levels compared with patients without aortic stenosis (652.2 +/- 218.7 vs 379.7 +/- 159.9 ng/mL, P &lt; .01).
During a median of 4.5 years, 126 patients (11%) died. Mean (+/- standard deviation) uric acid levels were 390 +/- 131 micromol/L in patients who died versus 353 +/- 86 micromol/L among survivors (hazard ratio 1.48 per 100 micromol/L; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.74; P &lt; .001). The excess risk associated with an elevated uric acid was particularly evident among patients in the upper quartile (&gt;or=410 micromol/L; hazard ratio vs all other quartiles combined 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-3.11; P &lt; .001). After adjusting for other potential prognostic variables, including the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, uric acid remained predictive of outcome.
Overall, troponin I and 8-isoprostane levels were lower in the controlled normoxic group (-29%, 95% CI -48% to -3%, P = .03, and -26%, 95% CI -44% to -2%, P = .03, respectively). Protein S100 release was also lower in the normoxic group 10 minutes after starting bypass (-26%, 95% CI -40% to -9%, P = .005) and 10 minutes after aortic crossclamp removal (-23%, 95% CI -38% to -3%, P = .02, respectively), but similar at other time points in the two groups (P &gt;or= .17). The alpha-glutamate transferase release was significantly lower in the normoxic group 10 minutes after aortic crossclamp removal (-28%, 95% CI -44% to -9%, P = .006, respectively) but was similar at other times (P &gt;or= .11). Release of C3a, interleukins 6, 8, and 10, and cortisol was similar in the two groups throughout (P &gt;or= .15).
Enlarged endothelial cells, lymphocytes inside the arteriolar wall, occluded arteriolar lumen, endothelial vacuolization, and hypertrophy of the vascular muscle were significantly correlated with rejection grade. Although none of the vascular abnormalities predicted cardiac allograft vasculopathy, patients with lipofuscin deposits at the 12-month biopsy specimens were characterized by the rapid development of angiography-confirmed cardiac allograft vasculopathy (P &lt; .08) and events related to cardiac allograft vasculopathy (P &lt; .03, log-rank test).
Pretransplant right and left ventricular ejection fractions were lower in the PAH group (29.8% +/- 7.0%, 49.9% +/- 6.6%) than in the non-PAH group (49.7% +/- 3.3%, 65.2% +/- 1.9%) (P = .010, .068). Two months after living-donor lobar lung transplantation, right ventricular ejection fraction and systolic pulmonary artery pressure in the PAH group (57.3% +/- 5.1%, 25.7 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) improved dramatically, equal to those in the non-PAH group. In contrast, left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index in the PAH group (50.9% +/- 3.7%, 2.66 +/- 0.12 L x min(-1) x m(-2)) were still significantly lower than in the non-PAH group (65.4% +/- 2.8%, 3.13 +/- 0.15 L x min(-1) x m(-2)) (P = .0038, .037). At 6 to 12 months, the PAH group demonstrated a significant rise in left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index that reached similar values in the non-PAH group measured at 2 months. These values were stable for up to 3 years.
After mean postimplant period of 43 days (range 7-70 days), patients had reversal of end-organ dysfunction; after mean waiting time of 31 days (range 21-67 days), all were transplant listed. Mean mechanical circulatory support was 87.7 days (range 26-105 days). No thromboembolic or neurologic events or mechanical failures occurred. Posttransplant mean ventilation and intensive care unit stay were 2 and 4 days (ranges 1-4 and 3-7 days), respectively. All patients were discharged home and remain alive and well.
We found that FXIII-A represents the only detectable source of TG activity in platelets and that the binding of fibrinogen in response to thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) stimulation was significantly reduced in platelets from the patients. In agreement with this, in control platelets, monodansyl-cadaverine (MDC), a competitive amino-donor for TGs, inhibited fibrinogen binding induced by TRAP in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, upon adhesion to fibrinogen, normal platelets incubated with MDC as well as FXIII-A-deficient platelets showed a distinct extension pattern with reduced lamellipodia and increased filopodia formation, suggesting a delay in spreading.
Glycocalicin was significantly reduced in Tph1(-/-) plasma and serum. In isolated platelets, 5-HT induced shedding of GPIbalpha, which was increased to 60% when 5-HT uptake was inhibited by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Specific 5-HT2AR agonism and antagonism suggested activation of this receptor. The shedding could not be induced in TACE(DeltaZn/DeltaZn) platelets, suggesting that activated TACE mediated the shedding of GPIbalpha. Intracellular signaling involved phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase rather than G-protein signaling. 5-HT2AR stimulation decreased platelet adhesion to collagen-bound von Willebrand factor under arterial shear (1500 s(-1)) and incorporation into FeCl3-induced thrombi in mesenteric arterioles.
Here we demonstrate that the partially activated alpha(IIb)beta3D723H or alpha(IIb)beta3D723A salt bridge mutants, but not fully activated alpha(IIb)beta3 mutants, cause this phenotype. Time-lapse videomicroscopy clearly differentiated these stable microtubule-driven and nocodazole-sensitive extensions from common dynamic actin-driven pseudopodia. In addition, overexpression of a mitochondrial marker confirmed their functional role in organelle transport. Comparative immunofluorescence analysis of the subcellular localization of alpha(IIb)beta3, the focal adhesion proteins talin or vinculin and actin revealed a similar membrane labeling of CHO cell extensions and CD34+-derived megakaryocyte proplatelets. Mutant alpha(IIb)beta3D723H signaling was independent of Src, protein kinase C or phosphoinositide 3-kinase, but correlated with decreased RhoA activity as compared with wild-type alpha(IIb)beta3 signaling, reminiscent of integrin signaling during neurite outgrowth. Accordingly, overexpression of constitutively active RhoA in CHO alpha(IIb)beta3D723H cells prevented protrusion formation on fibrinogen. Most interestingly, RhoA/ROCK inhibition was necessary, but not sufficient, and integrin activity was additionally required to induce CHO cell extension formation.
Beriplex P/N was the only agent that completely normalized TG and the INR. The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and the peak thrombin showed a significant negative correlation with all INRs. The ETP and velocity of TG reached a plateau at an INR of approximately 4.0. A concentration equivalent to a dose of 30 IU kg(-1) Beriplex P/N normalized the ETP, the INR, FII, FVII, FIX and FX of samples with INRs &gt; or = 4.0. Higher doses resulted in hypercoagulable TG patterns. A concentration equivalent to a dose of 20 IU kg(-1) was sufficient to reverse warfarin at an INR range of 2.0-3.9, as judged by the same tests.
In 32 of 42 patients (76.2%) with APS, APS and SLE, SLE, or SLE with antiphospholipid antibodies, EIA IgG or PaGIA for PF4-heparin complex antibodies were positive. Of these 32 samples, 26 (81.3%) tested positive for anti-PF4 antibodies. All 24 samples that were positive for PF4-heparin complex by EIA IgG were also positive for EIA IgG in the presence of heparin excess, and all were negative by the HIPA and heparin-induced platelet aggregation tests.
In all models, L-ASP alone or in combination with prednisone caused the intracellular retention of antithrombin associated with a severe deficiency. In contrast, the combination of L-ASP with dexamethasone ameliorated both the deficiency and intracellular retention of the serpin, which is associated with increased expression of heat shock proteins and ER-chaperons.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased MP PCA in wild-type mice; this PCA was significantly reduced by an anti-mouse TF antibody (1H1) but not with an anti-human TF antibody (HTF-1). Conversely, in mice expressing only human TF, MP PCA was inhibited by HTF-1 but not 1H1. MPs from wild-type mice had 6-fold higher levels of PCA using mouse factor (F)VIIa compared with human FVIIa, which is consistent with reported species-specific differences in FVIIa. Mice expressing low levels of human TF had significantly lower levels of MP TF activity and TAT than mice expressing high levels of human TF; however, there were similar levels of phosphatidylserine (PS)-positive MPs. Importantly, levels of MP TF activity in wild-type mice correlated with levels of TAT but not with PS-positive MPs in endotoxemic mice.
AVE5026 has a higher anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa) activity (approximately 160 U mg(-1)) along with a catalytic anti-thrombin (anti-FIIa) activity (approximately 2 U mg(-1)) as a result of its structure being strongly enriched in specific AT-binding oligosaccharides. In human plasma, potent inhibition of thrombin generation by AVE5026 was closely related to its anti-FXa activity. In a rat venous thrombosis model, AVE5026 showed a dose-dependent antithrombotic activity comparable to that of enoxaparin (ED50-AVE5026 = 1.6 mg kg(-1), ED50-enoxaparin = 2.8 mg kg(-1)). Interestingly, non-occlusive venous thrombosis in rabbits was inhibited by an ED50 of 0.1 mg kg(-1) AVE5026, whereas 0.316 mg kg(-1) enoxaparin was not active. In a canine model, similarly to enoxaparin (ED50 = 1.3 mg kg(-1)), AVE5026 dose-dependently inhibited arterial thrombosis (ED50 = 2.0 mg kg(-1)). At equipotent doses, AVE5026 did not affect bleeding parameters, whereas enoxaparin showed increased hemorrhage in rats, rabbits and dogs.
Positive LAC resulted in an increased risk for stroke [OR (95% CI) = 8.1 (2.4-27.5)]. Significant elevation in aPS IgG, aCL IgM and aCL IgG titers, and increased prevalence of elevated aPS IgG, aCL IgM and aCL IgG (based on P95 cutoff values of healthy individuals) were seen in patients. aPS IgG was associated with cardioembolic, whereas aCL IgG and IgM were elevated in lacunar, atherosclerotic and cardioembolic, and LAC positivity was documented only in lacunar stroke subtypes. The co-presence of LAC with a positive aCL IgM/IgG or aPS IgG did not affect the overall risk for stroke. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of positive LAC with stroke [aOR (95% CI) = 9.7 (1.8-52.5)], and demonstrated a clear gradation of increasing risk of stroke associated with the four categories of aCL IgG and aPS IgG, and identified aCL IgM P95 as independent predictors of stroke after adjusting for potentially confounding covariates.
Hemodilution reduced maximum clot firmness (MCF), whereas whole blood clotting time (CT) and maximum velocity remained unaffected. All coagulation factor activities were reduced. Fibrinogen, FII, FXIII and FX activities decreased significantly below the levels expected from dilution. The endogenous thrombin potential was unchanged. Ex vivo addition of fibrinogen normalized the reduced MCF and increased the maximum velocity, whereas PCC, rFVIIa and platelets shortened the CT but showed no effect on the reduced MCF.
Sequence homology demonstrates that TFPIalpha existed over 430 Ma while TFPIbeta and TFPIgamma evolved more recently. In situ hybridization studies of heart and lung did not reveal any cells exclusively expressing a single isoform. Although our previous studies have demonstrated that TFPIalpha mRNA is more prevalent than TFPIbeta or TFPIgamma mRNA in mouse tissues, western blot studies demonstrated that TFPIbeta is the primary protein isoform produced in adult tissues, while TFPIalpha is expressed during embryonic development and in placenta. Consistent with TFPIbeta as the primary isoform produced within adult vascular beds, the TFPI isoform in mouse plasma migrates like TFPIbeta in SDS-PAGE and mice have a much smaller heparin-releasable pool of plasma TFPIalpha than humans.
From the animals tested, only rabbit plasma was as efficient as human plasma in proteolysing rVWF in vitro. Mouse plasma virtually failed to cleave rVWF. Administration of human rVWF resulted in ADAMTS13-specific cleavage products in rabbits and, to a lesser extent, in cynomolgus monkeys at various doses of rVWF. Virtually no cleavage occurred in mice. ADAMTS13 activity levels in rabbit and monkey plasma were similar to those in human plasma and were not significantly altered upon infusion of rVWF up to very high doses, indicating that rVWF did not lead to an exhaustion of endogenous ADAMTS13 in both species.
We demonstrate R406 to be a powerful inhibitor of Syk in human platelets. R406 abrogated shape change and aggregation induced by activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and reduced platelet spreading on fibrinogen. The inhibitory effect of R406 was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins that lay downstream of Syk for all three receptors, including PLCgamma2. Strikingly, R406 markedly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk downstream of CLEC-2 activation, whereas phosphorylation of Syk downstream of GPVI and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 was unaffected.
Integrin alpha2beta1 recruitment induced an evident PLC activation that was concomitant with robust tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma2, and was suppressed in platelets from PLCgamma2-knockout mice. Moreover, PLCgamma2(-/-) platelets were unable to accumulate active Rap1b and to activate alpha(IIb)beta3 upon adhesion through alpha2beta1. Inhibition of Src kinases completely prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 in adherent platelets, but did not affect its activation, and both Rap1b and alpha(IIb)beta3 stimulation occurred normally. Importantly, alpha(IIb)beta3-induced phosphorylation and activation of PLCgamma2, as well as accumulation of active Rap1b, were totally suppressed by Src inhibition. Integrin alpha2beta1 recruitment triggered the Src kinase-independent activation of the small GTPase Rac1, and activation of Rac1 was not required for PLCgamma2 phosphorylation. However, when phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 was blocked by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2, prevention of Rac1 activation significantly reduced PLCgamma2 activation, GTP-Rap1b accumulation, and alpha(IIb)beta3 stimulation.
By genetic sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, a C-to-G change was identified in intron K for the Asian-associated major phenotype FXIII-B*3. A transcript containing the novel exon XII' was detected by reverse transcription PCR using hepatocyte cell lines with this allele. The exclusive existence of a novel C-terminal peptide in a homozygote of FXIII-B*3 was also detected by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. The FXIII-B*3 isoform had a C-terminus 15 residues longer than the other isoforms, containing two additional basic amino acids and one extra acidic amino acid. Accordingly, the C-to-G nucleotide substitution created an efficient splice acceptor AG dinucleotide, which resulted in allele-specific alternative splicing in intron K. When compared with FXIII-B*1, the third major phenotype, FXIII-B*2, had an A-to-G change in exon III, converting His95 to Arg, and a rare phenotype, FXIII-B*4, had an A-to-T change in exon VII, converting Glu368 to Val.
In freshly isolated human platelets, DOX induced platelet cytotoxicity in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, decreased glutathione levels and subsequent protein thiol depletion were shown to underlie the DOX-induced platelet cytotoxicity. Conspicuously, DOX-treated platelets displayed apoptotic features such as caspase-3 activation, reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and phosphatidylserine exposure. Decreased glutathiolation of procaspase-3 was shown to be a link between protein thiol depletion and caspase-3 activation. It is of note that DOX-mediated platelet cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced by shear stress, a common complicating factor in cancer patients. These in vitro results were further confirmed by an in vivo animal model, where administration of DOX induced a platelet count decrease, ROS generation, caspase-3 activation, protein thiol depletion, and damaged platelet integrity.
Mean baseline HbA(1c) for the study population was 8.2%. Liraglutide reduced mean HbA(1c) significantly more than did exenatide (-1.12% [SE 0.08] vs -0.79% [0.08]; estimated treatment difference -0.33; 95% CI -0.47 to -0.18; p&lt;0.0001) and more patients achieved a HbA(1c) value of less than 7% (54%vs 43%, respectively; odds ratio 2.02; 95% CI 1.31 to 3.11; p=0.0015). Liraglutide reduced mean fasting plasma glucose more than did exenatide (-1.61 mmol/L [SE 0.20] vs -0.60 mmol/L [0.20]; estimated treatment difference -1.01 mmol/L; 95% CI -1.37 to -0.65; p&lt;0.0001) but postprandial glucose control was less effective after breakfast and dinner. Both drugs promoted similar weight losses (liraglutide -3.24 kg vs exenatide -2.87 kg). Both drugs were well tolerated, but nausea was less persistent (estimated treatment rate ratio 0.448, p&lt;0.0001) and minor hypoglycaemia less frequent with liraglutide than with exenatide (1.93 vs 2.60 events per patient per year; rate ratio 0.55; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.88; p=0.0131; 25.5%vs 33.6% had minor hypoglycaemia). Two patients taking both exenatide and a sulphonylurea had a major hypoglycaemic episode.
Three patients in stratum 1 and 26 in stratum 2 never received the study drug. The risk of clinically significant bleeding with rivaroxaban versus placebo increased in a dose-dependent manner (hazard ratios [HRs] 2.21 [95% CI 1.25-3.91] for 5 mg, 3.35 [2.31-4.87] for 10 mg, 3.60 [2.32-5.58] for 15 mg, and 5.06 [3.45-7.42] for 20 mg doses; p&lt;0.0001). Rates of the primary efficacy endpoint were 5.6% (126/2331) for rivaroxaban versus 7.0% (79/1160) for placebo (HR 0.79 [0.60-1.05], p=0.10). Rivaroxaban reduced the main secondary efficacy endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with placebo (87/2331 [3.9%] vs 62/1160 [5.5%]; HR 0.69, [95% CI 0.50-0.96], p=0.0270). The most common adverse event in both groups was chest pain (248/2309 [10.7%] vs 118/1153 [10.2%]).
Probabilities of overall and recurrence-free survival 10 years after first treatment were 70% (95% CI 54-82) and 73% (54-85), respectively. Patients with stage I disease had a 10-year probability of overall survival of 90% (77-100) and did not benefit from postoperative chemotherapy. By contrast, patients with stage II, III, and IV disease required combined treatment with surgery and chemotherapy; probability of overall survival at 10 years was 52% (3-100) for patients with stage II disease and 49% (26-72) for stage III or IV disease. Outcome for patients who had recurrent or refractory disease was poor: only four (22%) patients achieved long-term survival beyond 60 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant independent predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival was time since antecedent pregnancy. A cutoff point of 48 months since antecedent pregnancy could differentiate between patients' probability of survival (&lt;48 months) or death (&gt;/=48 months) with 93% specificity and 100% sensitivity, and with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 98%.
One patient from the eflornithine group absconded after receiving the first dose, without any type of assessment done, and was excluded from all analyses. In the ITT population, 131 (91.6%) of 143 patients assigned to eflornithine and 138 (96.5%) of 143 patients assigned to NECT were cured at 18 months (difference -4.9%, one-sided 95% CI -0.3; p&lt;0.0001). In the PP population, 122 (91.7%) of 133 patients in the eflornithine group and 129 (97.7%) of 132 in the NECT group were cured at 18 months (difference -6.0%, one-sided 95% CI -1.5; p&lt;0.0001). Drug-related adverse events were frequent in both groups; 41 (28.7%) patients in the eflornithine group and 20 (14.0%) in the NECT group had major (grade 3 or 4) reactions, which resulted in temporary treatment interruption in nine and one patients, respectively. The most common major adverse events were fever (n=18), seizures (n=6), and infections (n=5) in the eflornithine group, and fever (n=7), seizures (n=6), and confusion (n=2) in the NECT group. There were four deaths, which were regarded as related to study drug (eflornithine, n=3; NECT, n=1).
Of the 64 hematologists who agreed to participate, 26 (41%) completed the vignettes. We found significant differences in the physicians' patterns of ordering further investigations among young and old patients in the same clinical context. This is not consistent with published guidelines. Moreover, the most striking differences concerned the physicians' interpretations of prognostic factors and the use of radiological testing before treatment. Modalities of treatment were variable across clinical situations, especially with regard to second-line treatments. Clinicians understood the vignettes well, except for those that dealt with stem cell transplantation.
Thirteen patients were detected during a 10-years period; 77% were male and the median age was 67 years (50-75 years). The median time of presentation was 10 weeks (1-24 weeks). All patients had episodic memory impairment, 77% had epileptic seizures and 77% had confusion or behaviour disturbances. A REM-behaviour disorder (RBD) was detected in all asked patients. MRI was abnormal in the 84.6%, EEG in the 91%, CSF in 60% and hyponatraemia was detected in the 83% of cases. All cases were treated with IGIV and/or costicosteroids and 61.5% remained asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms. After a median follow-up of 24 months (3-108 months) no patient developed cancer.
Eighteen patients (mean age 67,16+/-13,53; 11 women) were included. Five initially presented with acute bleeding and 13 with anemia. GAVE eradication was achieved over 3.38+/-1,4 sessions per patient. There were no major complications. Five patients had mild bleeding and 11 complained of abdominal pain, that was self-limited during treatment. Seven patients relapsed (39%); 3 of them with melenae and 4 with anemia. Two patients with hypergastrinemia developed hyperplastic polyps. No differences were found between relapsers and non-relapsers.
An improvement in the scores of BDI, BAI and in the subscales of EDI, Impulse to the thinness (EDI-DT) and corporal Dissatisfaction (EDI-BD) was observed. The differences were not significant for the rest of the psychometric tests. The multivariate analysis identified 3 predictive factors for postsurgical evolution: BDI (OR 0.91, IC95% 0.82-1.02), BIS (OR 1.08, IC 95% 1.0-1.16) y EDI-DT (OR 1.18, IC 95% 1.0-1.39).
The rate of legal abortions in immigrant women tripled those of Spanish women. A 76% increase in the rate was due to abortions carried out in immigrant women. Moreover, in women older than 30 years, the immigrant group represented 100% of the increment. Women aged 15 to 19 represented the exception, since the increase in these rates were primarily due to abortions performed in Spanish women.
We evaluated 164 patients; the mean age was 70 (15) years, males: 76 (46%). Median DD was 5 [interquartile range (IQ) 12) days. Median cTp-I in patients with DD&gt;5 was 0.003microg/L (IQ 0.072)microg/L while in patients with DD&lt;5 was 0.05microg/L (IQ 0.096) (p&lt;0.05). cTp-I higher than 0.5microg/L occurred in 11 (7%) patients. Levels of cTp-I higher than 0.03microg/L were associated with central PE, (AUROC 0.7059 CI95% 0.6643-0.7475, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.69, PPV 0.75 and NPV 0.69) and massive and submassive PE (AUROC 0.7685, CI95% 0.7288-0.8082 sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.66, PPV 0.72 and NPV 0.82), but they were not associated with mortality (AUROC 0.5394). In a multivariate analysis cTp-I did not show to be an independent predictor of central, massive and submassive PE or all causes death.
Twelve patients underwent 14 free fibula transfers (7 anterior and 5 posteriorly placed) for reconstruction of lumbosacral spinal defects. Preoperative diagnoses included tumor, osteomyelitis, and nonunion. Average number of vertebral body resections was four and posterior instrumentation was used for all arthrodeses. Average duration of follow up was 45 months. Two flaps failed (14%), one resulting in nonunion and the other required salvage with an external hemipelvectomy. All remaining flaps healed at a mean time of 4.5 months (range, 3-10 months).
Occasionally, wound healing disturbance and slight asymmetry of the breasts was observed, as well as colpocleisis revision needed. Partial flap necrosis took place in 6 patients, while 12 presented urethral stricture and 6 a fistula. Despite inferior neophallus sensibility, patients whose neophallus was created using fibula flap experienced better sexual intercourse. However, overall patients' satisfaction was superior.
Successful cultures were obtained, resulting in a monolayer to double layer cell sheets with a cobblestone-like morphology. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry disclosed an expression of both putative limbal stem cell (LSC) markers and differentiation-associated markers in the cultured cells. Most of the cultured corneal epithelial cells that were immunopositive for putative LSC markers were smaller, more uniform, and closer to the limbal explant than cells positively stained with differentiation-associated markers.
The mean ages were 63.8+/-9.5 and 61.8+/-10.2 years in POAG and control groups, respectively (p=0.18). There were no significant differences in the distribution of APOE, p53, and p21 genotypes between the healthy subjects and POAG patients (p=0.38, p=0.12, and p=0.2, respectively). There were no significant differences in maximum IOP, MD, and PSD values among different groups of p53 and p21 genotypes (p&gt;0.05). POAG subjects with the epsilon2epsilon3 genotype had a worse PSD value (median=2.2) than those with the epsilon3epsilon4 genotype (median=1.77; p=0.01) and POAG subjects with the epsilon3epsilon3 genotype had worse MD and PSD values (median= -7.4 and 3.4, respectively) than those with the epsilon3epsilon4 genotype (median= -4.1 and 1.77, respectively; p=0.034 and 0.028, respectively).
mAChR for subtypes M(1)-M(5) were detected in both mouse and human SFs by protein, cellular, and mRNA analysis. EGF-R, PKC, Pyk-2, B-Raf, Ras, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 were activated after treatment by agonists and antagonists, indicated by changes in phosphorylation of these proteins. Atropine abolished the carbachol-induced activation of SF cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Carbachol also activated p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Ras in a time-dependent manner. Muscarinic agents also modulated fibroblast growth factor expression in these cells.
The arterial pedicles of the infrahyoid muscles are the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. The arterial pedicles of the flap are the superior thyroid artery. The venous pedicles of the muscles and flap are the superior thyroid, lingual and facial veins. The infrahyoid flap is innervated by the ansa cervicalis.
The pedicle was lateral to the acromioxyphoid line in 19 cases, in close contact to the lateral border of the muscle.
En bloc surgical resection of kidney, suprarenal mass and spleen was performed, followed by initiation of mitotane chemotherapy 3 months later.
The average age of the glaucoma group was significantly more than that of the normal group: 68.3+/-12.3 years versus 55.7+/-12.1 years, respectively. For Stratus OCT, the average RNFL thickness (mean +/- standard deviation) was 99.4+/-13.2 microm, 94.5+/-15.0 microm, 79.0+/-14.5 microm, 62.7+/-10.2 microm, and 51.0+/-8.9 microm for the normal, suspect, mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. For Cirrus OCT, the corresponding measurements were 92.0+/-10.8 microm, 88.1+/-13.5 microm, 73.3+/-11.8 microm, 60.9+/-8.3 microm, and 55.3+/-6.6 microm. All Stratus-Cirrus differences were statistically significant by paired t testing (P&lt;0.001) except for the moderate group (P = 0.11). For average RNFL, there was also a highly significant linear relationship between Stratus minus Cirrus difference and RNFL thickness (P&lt;0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed that the systematic difference of Stratus measurements are smaller than Cirrus at thinner RNFL values but larger at thicker RNFL values.
Average RNFL thickness as determined by the 2 OCT machines was correlated (r = 0.94; P&lt;0.001), but was significantly different with the 2 machines (Stratus, 98.0 mum, standard deviation [SD] 18.0; Cirrus, 85.6 mum, SD 14.6; P&lt;0.001). The Cirrus HD-OCT classified a significantly higher percentage of eyes as abnormal (Stratus, 12.9%; Cirrus, 23.3%; P&lt;0.001) in average RNFL thickness. Cirrus OCT demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity (63.6% and 100%) than Stratus OCT (40.0% and 96.7%) in normative classification of average RNFL thickness.
The IOLMaster measured an axial length 0.10+/-0.15 mm shorter in pseudophakic eyes (P&lt;0.001). Calculations from IOLM-2 gave a significantly more hyperopic expected refraction than IOLM-1, with an averaged 0.20+/-0.46 diopters (D), 0.18+/-0.45 D, and 0.65+/-0.59 D calculated by the SRK II, SRK/T, and Haigis formulae, respectively. There was no significant difference among the 3 IOLs. The difference in estimation error correlated with the difference in axial length and anterior chamber depth (P&lt;0.001 for the SRK II, SRK/T, and Haigis formulae). However, the correlation was strongest when the Haigis formula was used for the calculation.
No difference in accommodative power or ACD were found between the groups (P&gt;0.05). The lens was thicker in the presence of Marfan's syndrome (P = 0.017 at baseline; P = 0.043 during accommodation; P = 0.046 during dilatation). The baseline pupil diameter was smaller in patients with Marfan's syndrome (P = 0.01), decreased less during accommodation (P = 0.02), and increased more during dilatation compared with controls (P&lt;0.01). No difference was found in these variables between the subgroups of eyes of patients with Marfan's syndrome with and without a subluxated lens (P&gt;0.05).
Sixteen eyes were completely symptom free and 12 eyes had mild pain but no evidence of recurrent corneal erosion after operation. Five eyes had repeated episodes of recurrent corneal erosion. Eyes with a traumatic cause responded better to Nd:YAG laser therapy than those without. The frequency of corneal erosions and the severity of pain significantly improved in eyes with macroform and symptom-only recurrence. There was no significant change in refraction, but corneal surface regularity slightly improved after surgery. No adverse reaction was observed during follow-up.
Although 2 specimens were excluded because anatomic details were severely disrupted during slide preparation, all the other samples demonstrated clear double layers of the lower eyelid retractors.
The ERM recurrence rate was 16.3% (17 eyes) and the reoperation rate was 5.8% (6 eyes) among the 104 eyes that underwent single ERM peeling, compared with 0% in 142 eyes with double ERM and ILM peeling. Although the ERM recurrence rate was significantly lower with double peeling, postoperative visual acuity did not differ between the 2 methods. The 3 ERM peeling methods differed in the rate and extent of residual ILM, and the lowest rate (21/54 eyes; 39%) was achieved with BBG staining (P&lt;0.0001). Histopathologic examination of the ILM remaining after ERM peeling detected remnant ERM cells on the ILM. Histopathologic examination of the peeled ERM in 6 eyes with ERM recurrence showed residual ILM to serve as a scaffold for cell proliferation.
Visual acuity results did not differ for the RE versus the LE, so data are reported for the RE only. Mean visual acuity for 5-year-olds (0.16 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] [20/29]) was significantly worse than for 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, and 12-year-olds (0.05 logMAR [20/22] or better at each age). The lower 95% prediction limit for determining whether a child has visual acuity within the normal range was 0.38 (20/48) for 5-year-olds and 0.30 (20/40) for 6- to 12-year-olds, which was reduced to 0.32 (20/42) for 5-year-olds and 0.21 (20/32) for 6- to 12-year-olds when recalculated with outlying data points removed. Mean interocular acuity difference did not vary by age, averaging less than 1 logMAR line at each age, with a lower 95% prediction limit of 0.17 log unit (1.7 logMAR lines) across all ages.
The use of microplasmin led to a progressively higher incidence of PVD induction on ultrasonography with increasing time exposure. A PVD before surgery was observed with 25 microg microplasmin in 0, 2, and 5 patients with increasing exposures (2 hours, 24 hours, 7 days). With increasing dose, a PVD before surgery was observed by ultrasound as follows: 25 microg, 0; 50 microg, 1; 75 microg, 2; 125 microg, 3. However, at surgery, with a 125-microg dose, these patients had a discontinuous layer of vitreous present on the retinal surface resulting from the induction of an anomalous PVD in the form of vitreoschisis. One retinal detachment developed shortly after administration of microplasmin. Two developed after surgery. There were no other safety concerns.
Amniotic tissue was covered with stratified corneal epithelium with well-defined desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. Transformed corneal stroma-derived cells (CSDCs) could be seen migrating from the anterior stroma, through breaks in the Bowman's zone, into connective tissue of the amniotic membrane. Immunohistology showed that the cells populating amniotic stroma were CD34 negative but positive for vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin. In 2 samples in which corneal transplants were performed approximately 1 year or more after AMT, some cells in the amniotic stroma showed CD34+ staining. Features of increased metabolic activity and formation of new collagen were seen on electron microscopy. In 2 cases, epithelial cell nests were seen in the amniotic stroma.
The TA was cleared from the aqueous in a monoexponential manner with a half-life of 29.6 days and clearance coefficient of 0.0234 (1/day). The extrapolated maximum TA concentration in aqueous was about 3312 ng/ml and the area under the curve was 74,017 day x ng/ml.
Quality scores of included studies were generally high, with a mean quality score of 12.7 (range, 9-16). Relative IOP reductions were peak, 15% (12%-18%), and trough, 18% (8%-27%) for timolol; peak, 14% (8%-19%), and trough, 12% (-7% to 31%) for dorzolamide; peak, 24% (17%-31%), and trough, 11% (7%-14%) for brimonidine; peak, 20% (17%-24%), and trough, 20% (18%-23%) for latanoprost; peak, 21% (16%-25%), and trough, 18% (14%-22%) for bimatoprost. The differences in absolute IOP reductions between prostaglandin analogues and timolol varied from 0.9 to 1.0 mmHg at peak and -0.1 to 0.2 mmHg at trough.
The intravisit repeatability of Cirrus HD-OCT ranged between 5.12 and 15.02 mum, and the intervisit reproducibility ranged between 4.31 and 22.01 mum. The intervisit variabilities of sectoral and average RNFL thicknesses were lower in Cirrus HD-OCT compared with Stratus OCT with significant differences at 1, 3, 4, and 8 to 11 o'clock (P&lt; or =0.021). There were proportional biases of RNFL measurements between the 2 OCT devices. The difference of RNFL thicknesses increased with the means. The average (AUC, 0.962 for Cirrus HD-OCT and 0.956 Stratus OCT), superior (AUC, 0.963 and 0.950, respectively), and inferior (AUC, 0.949 and 0.931, respectively) RNFL thicknesses demonstrated the greatest AUCs in both OCT devices with no significant difference detected between the respective measurements (P&gt; or =0.120). The strength of the structure-function association was comparable between Cirrus HD-OCT (R(2) = 0.580) and Stratus OCT devices (R(2) = 0.623; P = 0.918).
Of 190 subjects enrolled, 161 completed the 1-year postoperative visit. No subjects lost &gt; or =2 lines BSCVA. A UCVA of 20/20 or better was achieved by 57.8%; 99.4% had 20/40 or better. A BSCVA of 20/32 or better was achieved by 100% of subjects; 85.7% had 20/20 or better. The mean MRSE was -0.23 D (+/-0.50 D: -2.50 to 0.75 D). Residual refractive error was within +/-1.0 D from the target for 95.7% of subjects and within +/-0.5 D for 72.7% of subjects. The overall mean percentage change in central endothelial cell density 1 year after surgery was -4.77+/-8.04% (n = 139). No pupil ovalization, pupillary block, or retinal detachment events were observed.
The follow-up time ranged from 6 to 144 months (median, 18 months). The functional success rates were 100% at 1 month after surgery and 94% at the last follow-up. In the early postoperative period, 96.7%, 91.6%, and 97.5% of patients showed excellent cosmetic success rates regarding lid contour, symmetry, and lid crease, respectively. However, these rates decreased to 85.4%, 65.7%, and 66.9% at 6 months after surgery, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Similarly, the mean grades for lid contour, symmetry, and crease were lower at 6 months compared with early after surgery (P&lt;0.001). The only cosmetic parameter that differed between unilateral and bilateral patients was symmetry of height at 6 months after surgery. The occurrence of medial eyelash inversion increased from 0.8% at 1 month to 11% during the postoperative follow-up, and these cases required medial suspension release and strong double lid crease formation.
Compared with undilated BAT results, 29 of 54 patients (53.7%) lost 1 or more lines of vision during BAT testing after dilation. Undilated BAT results were predicted to within 1 line of accuracy in 44 of 54 patients (81.5%) by adjusting the dilated BAT result by the change in VA from dilation. With this method, results were predicted to within 2 lines of accuracy in 52 of 54 patients (96.3%).
At the initial stage of AP-ROP, FA showed vascular abnormalities, including capillary nonperfusion throughout the vascularized retina, shunting in the vascularized retina, a circumferential demarcation line, and limited vessel development, which was difficult to identify only by ophthalmoscopy. After treatment, FA showed poorly developed retinal vessels, including 4 small major vessels without an arcade pattern, small macular vessels, an inhomogeneous capillary bed, and absence of a capillary-free zone in the fovea.
Optical coherence tomography-evident macular edema occurred significantly less often in the triamcinolone group compared with the control group up to 18 months after plaque radiotherapy (hazard estimate, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.70; P = 0.001). At the 18-month follow-up, moderate vision loss (loss of 3 lines or more of best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA]) and severe vision loss (BCVA &lt;5/200 Snellen) occurred significantly less frequently in the triamcinolone group than in the control group (31% vs. 48% [P = 0.039] and 5% vs. 15% [P = 0.048], respectively). Rates of elevated intraocular pressure and cataract progression were similar in both groups.
There were no significant differences in the baseline intraocular pressures (IOPs), fluctuation amplitude of pretreatment IOP, baseline visual acuity, vertical cup-to-disc ratio, vertical disc diameter, presenting field indices, and central corneal thickness (CCT) between the 2 groups. Patients with SCI were significantly older compared with SCI- patients (72.4+/-10.7 vs. 63.2+/-14.2 years; P&lt;0.001). Univariate analyses revealed age, fluctuation amplitude of pretreatment IOP, thinner CCT, presence of disc hemorrhage, systemic hypertension, arrhythmia, and SCI were significant for field progression. Silent cerebral infarct was present in 29.6% of field-progressed subjects versus 15.3% of field-stable subjects (P = 0.004). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that 65.6% of SCI+ versus 45.9% of SCI- patients had progressed (P = 0.003). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed disc hemorrhage (hazard ratio [HR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-3.37; P&lt;0.001), SCI (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.36; P = 0.016), systemic hypertension (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-2.10; P = 0.029), and CCT (per 30 mum of thinning; HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16-1.75; P&lt;0.001) were associated with field progression. Other variables significant in the univariate analysis were not significant in the regression model. The most common location of SCI was at the basal ganglia.
Of the 3215 (98.9% of 3251) subjects for whom data on the lens status were available, 92 (41 male, 133 eyes) had undergone cataract surgery in 1 or both eyes (prevalence rate, 2.86%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.28-3.44). In multivariate analysis, this rate was statistically associated with higher age (P&lt;0.001), presence of angle-closure glaucoma (P = 0.02), and higher level of hemorrhagic retinopathy (P&lt;0.001). The prevalence of postoperative visual impairment was 27/133 (20.3%), as defined by a PVA &lt;6/18, and 14/133 or 10.5%, as defined by a BCVA &lt;6/18. Aphakia (odds ratio [OR], 6.71; P = 0.02) and rural residence (OR, 4.05; P = 0.01) were significantly associated with postoperative visual impairment. The most common causes of postoperative visual impairment were uncorrected refractive error followed by hemorrhagic retinopathy and posterior capsule opacification. By comparing 2001 with 2006, the rate of cataract surgery increased, and the rate of postoperative visual impairment decreased significantly (P = 0.049).
The mean long-term IOP reduction after latanoprost therapy was -3.4+/-2.4 mmHg in first-treated eyes (P&lt;0.0001) and -3.4+/-2.4 mmHg in second-treated eyes (P&lt;0.0001). The mean unadjusted IOP reduction in the monocular trial eye was -3.1+/-3.4 mmHg; the correlation between the unadjusted IOP change and the long-term IOP change was weak to moderate (coefficient of determination 0.325). The mean adjusted IOP reduction was -2.8+/-4.3 mmHg; the correlation between the adjusted IOP change and the long-term IOP change was also weak to moderate (coefficient of determination 0.279).
There were no patients with recurrence in 111 consecutive patients, and all but 2 patients were followed for at least 1 year. One patient developed an exotropia that required no treatment, and 1 patient lost 4 lines of vision as a result of a corneal ulcer.
Although 81% of patients had clinically quiescent disease, histopathology revealed that 74% had active corneal inflammation, a finding that was associated with the presence of clinical neovascularization (P = 0.01). Allograft rejections were experienced by 34% of the patients in this cohort. The histopathologic presence of inflammation was a risk factor for allograft rejection (P = 0.02). Corneal specimens demonstrating inflammation had significantly increased IL-8 (P = 0.0005) and MCP-1 (P = 0.003) levels, and greater immunoreactivity for HLA-DR and ICAM-1 when compared with specimens without inflammation. Treatment with IL-10 ex vivo significantly inhibited IL-8 (P = 0.006), and MCP-1 (P = 0.01) chemokines, and qualitatively substantially reduced HLA-DR, but not ICAM-1, expression.
Before surgery, the following were observed in all patients: corneal epithelial edema, subepithelial haze, keratocytes in a honeycomb pattern, and tiny needle-shaped materials in the stroma. After nDSAEK, subepithelial haze, donor-recipient interface haze, and interface particles were observed in all measurable cases; postoperative haze, interface particles, and needle-shaped materials decreased statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05) over the course of follow-up. In addition, hyperreflective giant interface particles were observed after nDSAEK in all patients.
Of 3372 PPV surgeries meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 1948 and 1424 surgeries were 20- and 25-gauge PPVs, respectively. Average age (+/- standard deviation) of patients was 54.6 (+/- 22.6) and 64.4 (+/- 16.5) years in the 20- and 25-gauge PPV groups, respectively (P&lt;0.0001). Median post-PPV follow-up time was not significantly different between the 2 groups (12.5 vs 13.0 months; P = 0.69). Endophthalmitis was observed in 1 patient (0.07%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-0.21%) from the 25-gauge group and none in the 20-gauge group (P = 0.42; Fisher exact test, 2-tailed). The use of air/gas endotamponade (P&lt;0.0001) and intravitreal triamcinolone (P&lt;0.001) was more common in 25- versus 20-gauge PPV.
Idiopathic macular holes occur at an age- and sex-adjusted incidence in 7.8 persons and 8.69 eyes per 100,000 population per year in Olmsted County, Minnesota. The female-to-male ratio was determined to be 3.3 to 1, and bilateral idiopathic macular holes occurred in 11.7% of patients and accounted for 20.9% of the affected eyes.
QFT is not superior to the TST in sensitivity as a screening test or first-line study in TB-related uveitis; however, QFT is more specific than the TST in identifying infections by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative QFT tests should be interpreted with caution, because they do not exclude the diagnosis.
Stereoacuity maturation normally proceeds rapidly during the first year of life. Infantile and accommodative esotropia are associated with profound and permanent disruption of stereopsis. Although rehabilitation of stereoacuity after treatment of esotropia remains a challenge, even the achievement of subnormal stereoacuity may have real benefits to the child.
Myopic children showed significantly higher AC/A ratios, which led to greater lens-induced exophoria and a greater demand for vergence adaptation. Both refractive groups showed significant vergence adaptation; however, myopes exhibited significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01) magnitudes compared with emmetropes (myopes = 3.95 +/- 0.15 Delta; emmetropes = 4.41 +/- 0.08 Delta). The mean PC was also significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced in myopes (61.02 +/- 1.57) compared with emmetropes (76.6 +/- 2.10). There was a significant correlation between magnitude of adaptation and AC/A in both the refractive groups; however, myopes consistently showed reduced magnitudes compared to emmetropes. AC/A ratio influenced PC in emmetropic but not myopic children. In the accommodation system, +2 D lenses eliminated the accommodative lags observed in myopic children during natural viewing conditions. These lenses resulted in a small over-focus (-0.24 +/- 0.27 D) at the onset of near work, which decreased during sustained viewing through the near add.
The DS group demonstrated a high frequency and magnitude of refractive errors (mean DS + 2.52 +/- 3.00 D; mean controls -0.46 +/- 1.32 D). The majority of controls had little or no significant refractive error. DS cornea were significantly steeper (mean DS 45.62 +/- 2.13 D; mean controls 43.10 +/- 1.37 D). Neither DS nor control data demonstrate significant relations between corneal and total refractive power (M vector). Astigmatic errors in the DS group were more frequently oblique and demonstrated strong right-left specificity. The DS data did not demonstrate a significant association between corneal and total astigmatism along principal meridians (J0), however, a significant relation was found for the control data (linear regression, r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.0001). No significant association between corneal and total oblique astigmatism (J45) was demonstrated by either DS or control data.
VEP grating acuity loss and VEP vernier acuity loss were significantly related (r = 0.70) with a slope of 1.31, indicating that indicating that on average, vernier acuity showed a 0.2 log unit deficit compared with VEP grating acuity. Behavioral grating acuity loss and VEP grating acuity loss were also significantly related (r = 0.64) with a slope of 1.55, indicating that behavioral acuity was more reduced (by approximately 0.3 log unit). VEP vernier acuity loss and behavioral grating acuity loss were significantly related (r = 0.66) with a slope of 0.85, indicating that behavioral acuity and VEP vernier acuity showed a similar magnitude of reduction. A Bland-Altman comparison between the VEP vernier acuity method and the behavioral acuity method showed a flat slope (0.30), indicating that the two measures produce similar visual acuity measures across the range of acuity levels.
Albinism is now classified based on genes known to be responsible for albinism. Foveal hypoplasia is invariably present and individuals with albinism often have delayed visual development, reduced vision, nystagmus, a positive angle kappa, strabismus, iris transillumination, and absent or reduced melanin pigment in the fundi. A visual-evoked potential can document the excessive retinostriate decussation seen in albinism. Grating acuity can be used to document delayed visual development in preverbal children. Glasses are often needed to improve visual acuity and binocular alignment.
Grating acuity was finer than optotype acuity among amblyopic eyes (medians: 0.28 vs. 0.40 logMAR, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) but not among fellow eyes (medians: 0.03 vs. 0.10 logMAR, respectively, p = 0.36). The optotype acuity-grating acuity discrepancy among amblyopic eyes was larger for cases of severe amblyopia than for moderate amblyopia (means: 0.64 vs. 0.18 logMAR, respectively, p = 0.0001). Nevertheless, most cases of amblyopia were detected successfully by the TAC, yielding a sensitivity of 80%. Furthermore, grating acuity was relatively sensitive to all amblyopia subtypes (69 to 89%) and levels of severity (79 to 83%).
Twenty-eight of 31 VGB patients were testable with binocular WSKP and their median visual field extents were smaller than controls. In 8 of 28 (29%) VGB patients, binocular field extents were smaller than the minimum in the control subjects. Monocular WSKP results did not differ between VGB patients and control subjects. Nine VGB patients were testable with both WSKP and GKP; visual field extents did not differ between tests.
The mean +/- SD spherical equivalent refractive error was -1.00 D +/- 2.25 (range, -6.00 D to +3.44 D). Greater power in the log of the high-frequency component of accommodative microfluctuations was associated with thinner ciliary bodies (p = 0.03) and lower ages (p = 0.0004). More hyperopic refractive errors with greater power in the high-frequency component (p = 0.0005) and the low-frequency component (p = 0.02). No statistically significant relationship was found for the low-frequency component or root mean square of accommodative microfluctuations and refractive error.
One hundred twenty-nine of the 158 subjects (81.65%) passed the DEM test. There was no significant correlation between any component of DEM test performance and quantitative eye movement parameters (gain, latency, asymptotic peak velocity, and number of corrective saccades) or symptomatology. There were significant correlations between DEM test outcome and reading performance, and with visual processing speed.
Univariate linear regression analyses showed no associations between the change in refractive error and defocus at distance or near. Change in refractive error was linearly related to the accommodative response at distance (R = 0.17, p &lt; 0.0001) and near (R = 0.13, p &lt; 0.0001). The ten subjects with the poorest emmetropization relative to the change predicted by the linear effects of their refractive error had higher average levels of hyperopic defocus at distance and near (p &lt; 0.043). Logistic regression showed a decrease in the odds of reaching +2.00 diopter or less hyperopia by 18 months with increasing levels of hyperopia at 3 months, or if Mohindra retinoscopy was myopic combined with acuity better than the median level of 1.25 logMAR [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.78 (95% CI = 0.68 to 0.88)].
Typically, in comparison to older observers, contrast response functions in infants are relatively linear with increases in contrast, and they exhibit little if any contrast gain control (amplitude compression and phase advance with increasing contrast). Time constants in infants are longer than in adults, and infants demonstrate less decrease in time constant values with increasing contrast than do adults.
Errors were not made on the DeltaL* = 15 series. Only isolated errors were made on the DeltaL* = 10 series. Errors were made on the DeltaL* = 5 series that diminished with age to nil in the older groups. Errors were made on the DeltaL* = 3 series at all ages studied, which also diminished with increasing age.
No significant difference was found between the amblyopic and age-matched control group for any of the outcome measures of the DEM (vertical time, horizontal time, number of errors and ratio(horizontal time/vertical time)). The DEM measures were not significantly related to VA in either eye, level of binocular function (stereoacuity), history of strabismus, or refractive error.
Curve fitting revealed that global hyperacuity was 0.25 logMAR at 0.25 years of age, and improved rapidly to -0.56 logMAR at 5.4 years of age but did not reach the mean adult level (-0.86 logMAR) until 21 years of age. Global hyperacuity started to deteriorate from 55 years of age at the rate of 0.035 logMAR per decade. In comparison, resolution acuity reached 0.0 logMAR at 5 years of age, and reached the adult level of -0.1 logMAR at 11 years of age. Resolution acuity also started to decrease from 55 years of age at the rate of 0.058 logMAR per decade.
The analysis cohort consisted of 1722 Black and Hispanic children aged 30 to 72 months. Mean logMAR VA improved with age (p &lt; 0.0001) and male gender (p = 0.0008). The proportion of children achieving VA 20/40 or better was associated with age (p &lt; 0.0001), but not ethnicity or gender, and was 81, 94, 99, and virtually 100% in children aged 30 to 35, 36 to 47, 48 to 59, and 60 to 72 months of age, respectively. The most stringent VA threshold that excluded &lt;5% of normal children was 20/63, 20/50, 20/32, and 20/32 for children aged 30 to 35, 36 to 47, 48 to 59, and 60 to 72 months, respectively. Children attending preschool or daycare achieved VA 20/32 more often than those not attending, after age adjustment (p = 0.01), as did children from higher-income families (p = 0.04). There was no association between mean absolute IOD and age (p = 0.45), ethnicity (p = 0.12), or gender (p = 0.19). The proportion of children with an IOD of 0 to 1 lines was higher in males than females (p = 0.02); it did not vary by age (p = 0.06) or ethnicity (p = 0.17). An IOD of 2 or more lines occurred in 6% of normal children.
Synchronized electromyograms for leg muscles, force and video were recorded continuously from embryos while in their naturally flexed posture at embryonic day (E) 15, E18 and E20. We tested for effects of leg posture and constraint by removing shell wall anterior to the foot. Results indicated that by E18, burst onset time distinguished leg muscle synergists from antagonists across a 10-fold range in burst frequencies (1-10 Hz), and knee extensors from ankle extensors in patterns comparable to locomotion at hatching. However, burst durations did not scale with step cycle duration in any of the muscles recorded. Despite substantially larger leg movements after shell removal, the knee extensor was the only muscle to vary its activity, and extensor muscles often failed to participate. To further clarify if the repetitive movements are likely locomotor-related, we examined bilateral coordination of ankle muscles during repetitive movements at E20. In all cases ankle muscles exhibited a bias for left/right alternation.
Since bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) contains innate immune and other components found in the lungs, we examined gene expression of a virulent serovar 1 strain of A. pleuropneumoniae after a 30 min exposure to BALF, using DNA microarrays and real-time PCR. The functional classes of genes found to be up-regulated most often in BALF were those encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism, especially anaerobic metabolism, and in cell envelope, DNA, and protein biosynthesis. Transcription of a number of known virulence genes including apxIVA and the gene for SapF, a protein which is involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides, was also up-regulated in BALF. Seventy-nine percent of the genes that were up-regulated in BALF encoded a known protein product, and of these, 44% had been reported to be either expressed in vivo and/or involved in virulence.
This prospective study was conducted at The Homerton University Hospital, London between January 2006 and March 2007. Using applanation tonometry, the radial artery pulse waveform was recorded and the aortic waveform derived. Augmentation pressure (AP) and Augmentation Index at heart rate 75/min (AIx-75), measures of arterial stiffness, were calculated. We recruited 665 women with singleton pregnancies. Women who developed pre-eclampsia (n = 24, 3.6%) or gestational hypertension (n = 36, 5.4%) were excluded. We also excluded 47 women with other pregnancy complications or incomplete follow-up, leaving 541 healthy normotensive pregnant women for subsequent analysis. In the overall group of 541 women, there were no significant changes in AP or AIx-75 as pregnancy progressed. In 45 women followed longitudinally, AP and AIx-75 fell significantly from the first to the second trimester, then rose again in the third (P&lt;0.001). The two main ethnic groups represented were Caucasian (n = 229) and Afrocaribbean (n = 216). There were no significant differences in AP or AIx-75 in any trimester between these two ethnic groups.
The analyses of this set of sequences included BLAST scores, multiple sequence alignment, examination of patterns of covariant residues, phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the sequences flanking the conserved Cys and His residues that attach the FeMo cofactor to NifD and that are also conserved in the alternative nitrogenases. The results show that NifD nitrogenases fall into two distinct groups. Group I includes NifD sequences from many genera within Bacteria, including all nitrogen-fixing aerobes examined, as well as strict anaerobes and some facultative anaerobes, but no archaeal sequences. In contrast, Group II NifD sequences were limited to a small number of archaeal and bacterial sequences from strict anaerobes. The VnfD and AnfD sequences fall into two separate groups, more closely related to Group II NifD than to Group I NifD. The pattern of perfectly conserved residues, distributed along the full length of the Group I and II NifD, VnfD, and AnfD, confirms unambiguously that these polypeptides are derived from a common ancestral sequence.
In the present study we explored the regions of nucleolin and ErbB responsible for their interaction. Using mutational analyses, we addressed the structure-function relationship of the interaction between ErbB1 and nucleolin. We identified the ErbB1 nuclear localization domain as nucleolin interacting region. This region is important for nucleolin-associated receptor activation. Notably, though the tyrosine kinase domain is important for nucleolin-associated receptor activation, it is not involved in nucleolin/ErbB interactions. In addition, we demonstrated that the 212 c-terminal portion of nucleolin is imperative for the interaction with ErbB1 and ErbB4. This region of nucleolin is sufficient to induce ErbB1 dimerization, phosphorylation and growth in soft agar.
Hair sheep blood obtained by jugular venipuncture was anticoagulated by either manual defibrination or collection in human blood bank bags containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose. Trypticase soy 5% blood agar was made from both forms of hair sheep blood and commercial defibrinated wool sheep blood. Growth characteristics, colony morphologies, and hemolytic patterns of selected human pathogens, including several streptococcal species, were evaluated. Specialized identification tests, including CAMP test, reverse CAMP test, and satellite colony formation with Haemophilus influenzae and Abiotrophia defectiva were also performed. Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates prepared from the three blood types were compared in antibiotic susceptibility tests by disk diffusion and E-test.
To examine the ability of the KCNMB family of auxiliary beta subunits to regulate Slo3 function, we co-expressed Slo3 and each beta subunit in heterologous expression systems and investigated the functional consequences by electrophysiological and biochemical analyses. The beta4 subunit produced an 8-10 fold enhancement of Slo3 current expression in Xenopus oocytes and a similar enhancement of Slo3 surface expression as monitored by YFP-tagged Slo3 or biotin labeled Slo3. Neither beta1, beta2, nor beta3 mimicked the ability of beta4 to increase surface expression, although biochemical tests suggested that all four beta subunits are competent to coassemble with Slo3. Fluorescence microscopy from beta4 KO mice, in which an eGFP tag replaced the deleted exon, revealed that beta4 gene promoter is active in spermatocytes. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that beta4 and Slo3 exhibit comparable mRNA abundance in both testes and sperm.
The limbs were involved in all ages, but involvement of the joints, ribs, and spine was uncommon in patients under 5 years old. Pain started between 6 pm and 12 midnight in 33.3%. Analgesics with or without massage or hydration was mostly used at home. 29% of subjects required hospitalization.
Response rate and transfusion-independent survival of the ATG group were both significantly higher than those of the non-ATG group (83.33 vs. 41.7%, p = .006; and 83.33 vs. 50%, p = .043, respectively). Compared with non-ATG group, fewer patients in ATG group progress to severe aplastic anemia (p = .03).
Complete tumor resection was achieved in 21 patients (but in only 1 case of hand/foot RMS); all patients received chemotherapy and 43 also had radiotherapy. The alveolar subtype was identified in 62% of cases. Half of the hand/foot cases had metastatic disease at onset. Overall survival at 5 years was 33% among the hand/foot cases and 56% for the others. Most of the relapsing cases had distant metastases.
Ten patients died from transplant-related toxicity and 4 had relapse or disease progression post-AHSCT. Nine patients are alive and event-free with a median follow-up of 120 months. EFS rate in the MRD group was 0.48 (SE 0.13) versus 0.25 (SE 0.12) in the MUD/UCB group (p = .07). Lansky score in survivors is &gt;or=90%.
In monolayer cell culture high-dose octreotide (44 microM) resulted in mitotic inhibition with parallel increment of apoptosis. Combination with cytostatic drugs did not result in additive or synergistic effect, but vincristine was partially antagonized. In medulloblastoma xenograft, octreotide monotherapy (100 microg/kg/day for 10 days) resulted in partial tumor growth inhibition.
Shorter BAEP wave I, III, and V latencies and I-III and I-V intervals and higher wave V amplitude correlated with higher FA of the inferior colliculus.
A total of 116 infants (68 male, 48 female) underwent 176 procedures (159 vascular access-related and 17 nonvascular). Of 158 complications identified, 116 were major and 42 were minor. Major complications included hypothermia (n=33), line manipulations/removals (n=25), bleeding (n=12), thrombosis (n=4), cardiac arrest (n=3), tamponade (n=2), and multiorgan failure (n=1). Of the complications, 119 were categorized as intervention-/device-related, 32 patient-related and 7 equipment-related. There were no significant differences between pre- and postprocedural TRIPS scores.
The study included 128 CT angiograms. A THAD was seen in 9/26 infants &lt;1 month of age, in 3/50 infants 1 to 6 months of age, in 1/23 infants 6 months to 1 year of age, and in 1/29 infants 1 to 2 years of age. A THAD was found significantly more frequently in infants &lt;1 month of age than in the older age groups (P&lt;0.05).
There were nine patients (six boys and three girls). The age at presentation varied from 1 to 11 months (average 6 months). Tumours were located in the thorax/mediastinum (n=3), liver (n=3), neck (n=1), shoulder (n=1) and axilla (n=1). The imaging modalities used included US (n=8), CT (n=7) and MRI (n=6). Bone scan was positive in one patient, while metastases at the time of diagnosis occurred in four patients. On MRI the tumours tended to show nonspecific hypointensity on T1-W images and heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2-W images, with heterogeneous enhancement.
The incidence of spinal cord anomalies was no different between those with a high lesion and those with a low lesion, and spinal cord anomalies were present regardless of the presence of vertebral anomalies or symptoms.
The percentage enhancement of the bowel wall was significantly increased in patients with abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) values compared to patients with CRP values in the normal range (P&lt;0.001). A relatively weak but significant correlation between percentage enhancement of the bowel wall and CRP values was noted during all phases of enhancement.
All patients presented with persistent inspiratory stridor that was present from the first week of life. Neck US was performed as part of the investigations in four and showed a vallecular cyst. The diagnosis was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy in four infants and CT in one; all were resected. Pathology showed a multilayered epithelial border with normal thickness and differentiation; there were no signs of malignancy.
Three neonates were found to have neonatal hemochromatosis; all of them were associated with patent ductus venosus. Two of these patients were referred to our tertiary center for embolization of an inaccurately diagnosed hepatic vascular malformation. Two patients underwent successful liver transplantation and one died shortly after referral.
The PNAP formulations possessed properties suitable for efficient deposition in the lungs. In vitro release showed an initial burst of rifampicin, with the remainder available for release beyond eight hours. PNAPs delivered to guinea pigs by insufflation achieved systemic levels of rifampicin detected for six to eight hours. Moreover, rifampicin concentrations remained detectable in lung tissue and cells up to and beyond eight hours. Conversely, after pulmonary delivery of an aerosol without nanoparticles, rifampicin could not be detected in the lungs at eight hours.
The polymer-stabilized ISA51 emulsions have high affinity to water, such that the stock of antigen-encapsulating emulsion could be re-dispersed into PBS before injection, thus yielding stable and injectable W/O/W emulsion nanoparticles. Immunogenicity studies showed that PEG-b-PLACL/ISA51/PBS-formulated ovalbumin with only 5% of ISA51 oily adjuvant could induce the same level of antibody titers as those induced by PBS/ISA51-formulated ovalbumin.
The various formulations showed extended linear release for several weeks with minimal burst effect. Best in-vivo efficacy was obtained with ACC7201 containing implants, resulting in the extension of the median survival from 13 to 18 days with 13% long-term survivors.
Multiple administration of h-IFN without co-administration of tacrolimus induced IgG response at 2 or 3 weeks following first administration in the short dosing interval (daily, once per 3 days, or once per a week), irrespective of the dosing interval. Both intravenous and subcutaneous administration of tacrolimus (0.5 mg/kg) with multiple h-IFN injections successfully suppressed IgG response against h-IFN. Interestingly, in lower doses (0.001 mg/kg), intravenous co-administration of tacrolimus showed much stronger suppressive effect than subcutaneous co-administration.
For Vd(beta), predicted values within twice the observed value were obtained for 72.1% of drugs by both methods Ia and Ib, respectively, in which only rat pharmacokinetic data were used. The corresponding percentage was 75.0% for method II, in which pharmacokinetic data from animals other than rats were used. For BA, predicted values within 1.3 times the observed values were obtained for 66.7% and 57.4% of drugs by methods Ia and Ib, respectively, and 75.0% by method II.
All copper complexes possess distorted square planar geometries with 1:1 metal to ligand stoichiometry with reversible copper redox couple. The difluoro compound CDF exhibited inhibitory effects on purified rabbit 20S proteasome or cellular 26S proteasome, and caused both growth inhibition of cancer cell lines and induced apoptotic cell death in our preliminary assessment.
Modeling and simulations reveals that: (1) the elevated effect by methylation occurs before the decreased effect via transsulfuration promotion, and the decreased effect is more profoundly dose-dependent than the elevated effect; (2) two steps are simplified to describe the delayed stimulatory effect on the transsulfuration in the model; (3) long term administration of danshensu dose not affect tHcy in normal rats, while it significantly reduces tHcy in rats treated with methionine. This is in consistent with previous report.
Specific (n = 23) and overlapping (n = 19) inhibitors of the three ABC transporters were identified. GF120918 and Ko143 were verified to specifically inhibit P-gp/BCRP and BCRP in defined concentration intervals, whereas the MRP inhibitor MK571 was revealed to inhibit all three transporters within one log unit of concentration. Virtual docking experiments showed that MK571 binds to the ATP catalytic site, which could contribute to its multi-specific inhibition profile. A computational model predicting general ABC inhibition correctly classified 80% of both ABC transporter inhibitors and non-inhibitors in an external test set.
A common features pharmacophore was derived from initial screening data and consisted of three hydrophobic features and a positive ionizable feature. Among the 33 tested drugs that were predicted to map to the pharmacophore, 27 inhibited hOCTN2 in vitro (40% or less L-carnitine uptake from 2.5 microM L-carnitine solution in presence of 500 microM drug, compared to L-carnitine uptake without drug present). Hence, the pharmacophore accurately prioritized compounds for testing. K(i) measurements showed low micromolar inhibitors belonged to diverse therapeutic classes of drugs, including many not previously known to inhibit hOCTN2. Compounds were more likely to cause rhabdomyolysis if the C(max)/K(i) ratio was higher than 0.0025.
In 96% of the rats, only the targeted nasal cavity was deeply colored. Corticosterone plasma concentrations were not influenced, neither by route nor volume of administration. Pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were identical after intravenous and intranasal administration, although the Cmax in microdialysates was reached a little earlier following intravenous administration.
Monoacylglycerols and PEG monoesters are the largest compounds present at the end of gastric phase whereas PEG-monoesters are the largest compounds after the duodenal phase. The precipitation of piroxicam is mainly due to the gastric lipolysis. In the control experiments performed without digestive lipases, cinnarizine formulated in Labrasol was found to precipitate upon dilution of the gastric medium to form the solution mimicking the duodenal medium. In the presence of gastric lipase, Labrasol was hydrolyzed and the precipitation of cinnarizine was not observed in this case. When the cinnarizine was formulated with Gelucire 44/14 the precipitation was only due to the dilution of the gastric medium.
The tumor diameter increased at a constant rate for all the groups between days 7-14. After a single intratumoral bolus dose of chitosan/GMO containing PTX showed significant reduction in tumor diameter on day 15 when compared to control, placebo and intravenous PTX administration. The tumor diameter reached a maximal decrease (4-fold) by day 18, and the difference was reduced to approximately 2-fold by day 21. Qualitatively similar results were observed in a separate study containing PTX when administered intravenously.
The typical of the ANC at baseline (Circ(0)), mean transit time (MTT), feedback parameter (gamma), k(in) and alpha were estimated to be 5,610 x 10(6)/L, 3.25 days, 0.145, 0.954 cell/kg/day and 2.50 h/U, respectively. rHuG-CSF shortens the MTT by 92% and increases the mitotic activity by 120%. Bootstrap analysis, visual predictive check and numerical predictive checks evidenced accurate prediction of the ANC nadir, time to ANC nadir and time to grade 4 neutropenia recovery.
Based on modeling/simulation, fexofenadine systemic exposure was most sensitive to changes in the hepatic uptake rate constant, and did not reflect changes in hepatic exposure due to altered hepatic efflux. GF120918 did not impair fexofenadine biliary excretion in human SCH. GF120918 coadministration significantly decreased Cl'(biliary) to 27.5% of control in perfused rat livers.
It was found that ABP was able to condense pDNA efficiently at N/P ratio of 4. The particle sizes of ABP/pDNA complexes were less than 220 nm, and the average surface charges were around 27 mV at the N/P ratio ranging from 2 to 60. Among three different cell lines, ABP and its DNA complexes demonstrated much lower cytotoxicity and higher transfection efficacy in HepG2 cells as compared with 25 kDa PEI.
Maximum flux and stratum corneum solubilities of the phenolic compounds both showed a bilinear dependence on octanol-water partition coefficient (P), with solutes having a maximum solubility in the stratum corneum when 2.7&lt;log P&lt;3.1. In contrast, lag times and diffusivities were relatively independent of P. Stratum corneum-water partition coefficients and epidermal permeability coefficients were consistent with previously reported data.
The mesylate salts of two model pharmaceutical compounds were found to disproportionate to the free base form when physically mixed with certain common basic excipients and exposed to moderate relative humidities. In contrast, the napsylate salts were much more resistant to disproportionation. The napsylate salts had solubilities more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the respective mesylate salts, and showed little to no detectable formation of free base. The mesylate salts with higher solubilities showed significant levels of conversion to the free base.
NR delivery into the SC was greater from the larger particles, the overall smaller surface area of which enhanced the "leaving tendency" of the lipophilic "active". Skin uptake of NR (measured as "%payload released") from polystyrene, CAPA and CAB particles increased with decreasing polymer hydrophobicity (polystyrene &gt; CAPA &gt; CAB) as expected. Confocal microscopy revealed that NR released from the particles accumulated in, and penetrated via, lipid domains between the SC corneocytes. The particles showed affinity for hairs, and concentrated on the skin surface at the follicular openings.
PLA particles penetrated into 50% of the vellus hair follicles, reaching a maximal depth corresponding to the entry of the sebaceous gland in 12-15% of all observed follicles. The accumulation of particles in the follicular ducts was accompanied by the release of dye to the viable epidermis and its retention in the sebaceous glands for up to 24 h. Kinetic studies in vitro as well as in skin explants revealed, that, although stable in aqueous solution, destabilization of the particles and significant release of incorporated dye occurred upon contact with organic solvents and the skin surface.
The release of stratifin was delayed for 3 days and then controlled for 30 days so that 60% of the total stratifin loaded was released. The released protein significantly stimulated the expression of MMP-1 in cultured fibroblasts without compromising cell viability. By complexing to chitosan, the initial burst release was reduced, so that only 5% of stratifin was released in 3 days.
Addition of divalent cationic salts solely to the organic phase did not provide acylation inhibition. However, addition of the salt inhibitors to both the primary emulsion and the outer water phase resulted in improved drug and salt encapsulation efficiency as well as significantly decreased salt leaching and octreotide acylation. After 28 days, the extent of acylation inhibition afforded by divalent cations was &gt; 58% relative to 13% for the NaCl control group.
During the study, 9,719 unit dose medication cassettes were filled by pharmacy technicians. Pharmacists detected 706 errors for a total of 88,609 filled and omitted unit doses. An overall error rate of 0.80% was found. There were approximately 0.07 detected dispensing errors per medication cassette. The most common error types were improper dose errors (n = 265, 37.5%) and omission errors (n = 186, 26.3%). Many causes may probably explain the occurrence of dispensing errors, including communication failures, problems related to drug labeling or packaging, distractions, interruptions, heavy workload, and difficulties in reading handwriting prescriptions.
Face and content validity were established by pilot and peer review. Pearson's coefficient of 0.53 indicated an acceptable level of concurrent validity. Factor analysis yielded factors closely related to the theoretical stages of cognitive moral development hypothesised, which indicated construct validity. Cronbach's alpha of 0.75 demonstrated the reliability of the instrument, and linear regression models provided further evidence of construct validity. The PEP was established as a robust instrument on several dimensions of validity and reliability.
One hundred and fifty-five pharmacies consented to distribute questionnaires to five patients each, yielding a total of 358 useable questionnaires (response rate of 46%). The first point of contact about OTC medicines was the pharmacist (61% of patients), followed by the physician (29%). Newspapers and the internet were not viewed as primary sources of advice on OTC medicines. Patients tended to purchase OTC medicines for the acute treatment of pain, gastro-intestinal conditions, common cold, cough or musculo-skeletal pain. More than 75% of patients felt that pharmacists provided sufficient information about the health condition and OTC medicine use. About one-third of patients did not wish the physician to be informed of their OTC medicine use. Patients did not seem to agree with distribution channels for OTC medicines other than the community pharmacy.
From April to July 2007, we collected 12,427 observation forms from 46 hospitals in Jiangsu Province of China. Among the 11,707 observation forms we analyzed, 8,074 patients were children younger than 14 years old (69%). Among 51 reported adverse drug events, 45 cases were adverse drug reactions. The total adverse drug reaction incidence of the injection was 0.38%. While most adverse drug reactions were previously known (e.g., rash, pruritus, vomiting and diarrhea), we observed three new ADR symptoms: shiver, phlebitis and anhelation. All the adverse drug reactions were controlled very well through the follow-up therapy, and none of them was life threatening. The mono-factor analysis showed that adverse drug reactions of the injection were significantly correlated with total medication dose (P = 0.0049) and combination medication (P = 0.0143), especially with antimicrobial drugs (P = 0.0079) and macrolides (P = 0.0017). The multiple factor analysis confirmed these results: medication dosage and combination medication had a crucial impact on adverse drug reactions of the injection; the risk was increased by 24.8% (the estimated value of relative risk was 1.248, 95% confidence interval: 1.054-1.479) and 89% (1.890, 1.001-3.566), respectively.
Eighty-three participants completed both scales. Patients with missing values differed significantly regarding age, education, and adherence according to MMAS. Cronbach's Alpha for A14 was 0.861. MMAS and A14 median total scores were 4 and 52, respectively. About 39.5% of patients were non-adherent as per MMAS compared to 40% as per A14; kappa was 0.262 (P = 0.016). The total scores correlated with a Rho-value of 0.43 (P &lt; 0.001).
Overall results showed that a three observer panel gave better weight estimates than one or two individuals.
Eighteen of the 200 patients had an allergy-related ICD code in the chart, 51 had a written note, and 13 had both. About 21% of patients with documented drug allergies were prescribed a drug potentially triggering the allergy. There was no difference in prescribing errors due to drugs potentially inducing allergies when the allergy was only documented as an ICD-10 code or the information was available in the paper record (P &gt; 0.05).
A total of 1,630 type 2 diabetic outpatients were identified; 19.3% (315/1,630) had at least one contraindication to metformin use, with chronic renal impairment being the most frequent risk (78%, 246/315). Of those with a contraindication, 84.4% (266/315) were metformin users. Compared to non-metformin users, there were no significant differences in the number of hospitalizations and deaths. No cases of lactic acidosis were evident. Metformin use in the presence of contraindications did not affect the risks of hospitalization (OR 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-1.4, P = 0.34) or death (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11-3.15, P = 0.53). Other patient factors, such as the female gender or having diabetes-related complications, had significant influences on both outcomes.
Of 167 clients who requested or were invited to participate by pharmacists, 84 (50.3%) were screened. Analysis of collected data indicated that 33.3%, 21.4% and 27.4% of participants were at risk of having or developing insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) respectively, while 38.1% were not at risk of any of the screened disorders. OSA odds increased 12.8 times (95% CI: 3.2-50.4) with diabetes and 4.9 times (1.2-20.9) with opioid use, while shift workers were 8.4 times (1.6-43.2) more likely to have insomnia. Participants and pharmacists reported the screening protocol and instrument was user friendly and feasible.
A total of 102 responses were received yielding a response rate of 22.1%. The mean for physicians' attitude to support provision of MTM by pharmacists was 2.84 out of 5. The overall physicians' attitudes model for provision of MTM by pharmacists was found to be significant. Physicians' attitudes toward collaborative agreement, specialty, years of practice, physician-pharmacist communication frequency regarding patients communication, and gender had significant influences on physician attitudes toward provision of MTM by pharmacists.
A diagnosis of conduct disorder and impulsive behavior were both associated with severity of problem drinking and/or drug use. Further, interaction effects were found between the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and conduct disorder (trend level) as well as A1+ status and impulsivity, such that adolescents who were carriers of the A1 allele, and had conduct disorder or impulsive behavior, reported higher levels of problematic alcohol use than those who were non-carriers (A2/A2 or A1-). The same interaction effect between this polymorphism and impulsivity was found for severity of problem drug use. In contrast, no interaction effects were found between the DRD2 allele status and ADHD on severity of problem drinking or drug use.
Binge drinkers recorded a significantly shorter movement time to target in the RTI, and completed fewer stages on first trial in the PAL, compared with non-bingers. In the IED as well as in the SWM, only female binge drinkers were more impaired than non-binge drinkers.
Of the 72 mother-infant pairs with prenatally diagnosed CHD, 53 underwent NECHO. Overall, the FECHO diagnosis matched the NECHO diagnosis in 50 out of 53 cases (94.3%). The NECHO added diagnostic or functional information in 6 of the 53 FECHO cases. Three of these were minor and would not have resulted in a significant change of delivery plans. The other three were major findings and would have resulted in a revision of delivery planning. Overall, 96% of the delivery plans based on FECHO agreed with the delivery plans based on NECHO.
The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 24 weeks (range 13-38); 128 anomalies were detected and were classified into the following categories: I, Situs anomalies in 8 cases; II, abnormal four-chamber view in 63 cases; III, outflows tract anomalies in 27 cases; IV, arches anomalies in 21 cases; and V, veins anomalies in 9 cases. Rendering tools differed in each groups of anomalies.
Mean maternal age was 32.8 +/- 0.4 years. Among the couples, 88.61% knew that TOP due to fetal anomalies is not legal in their countries. When asked about the possibility of TOP in case of a serious fetal anomaly, 53% would contemplate this option.
Maternal BM had no effect on LBWR. LBWR was comparable to normal in CDH fetuses undergoing TO. Both TO and BM have an effect on medial thickening due to CDH which is larger when both interventions are combined.
Ultrasound identified 65 cases, 13 with isolated omphalocele and 6 with associated minor anomalies. These 19 cases represented 29.2% of the population (19/65); isolated omphalocele was confirmed in 14 neonates (14/19, 73.7%). In five neonates, unrecognized by prenatal ultrasound were cardiac anomalies (2 cases), tracheoesophageal atresia with cardiac anomaly (1 case), and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (2 cases). A minor ultrasound finding did not predict further anomalies at birth. Preterm delivery complicated 37.5%; the only deaths occurred among preterm infants. Follow-up of isolated omphalocele found no long-term medical issues or learning disabilities except speech delay.
Polyhydramnios occurred in most (mean 79%) pregnancies of cases in Groups I (98), II (107), and III (17); advanced paternal age and prematurity were noted in approximately half. Less frequent were nuchal thickening, ascites, shortened long bones, abnormal hand posture, ventriculomegaly, macrosomia, and macrocephaly. Fetal arrhythmia occurred in nine cases (six supraventricular or unspecified tachycardia, one unspecified arrhythmia, and two premature atrial contractions, PACs); excluding three new cases and two with PACs, the estimated prenatal frequency is 4/222 (2%).
On computed tomography and postnatal X-ray, proximal femoral metaphysis appeared rounded, with poor, uneven ossification. Connexion to diaphysis was abnormal, with relative overgrowth of the periosteum, creating a new diagnostic sign that we called the 'collar hoop' sign. On ultrasound, all fetuses had a very rounded metaphyseal-epiphyseal interface, with an angle connexion to diaphysis wider than expected. The 'collar hoop' sign was obvious on four of the fetuses. During the same period, proximal femoral metaphyses appeared normal in 653 healthy fetuses, suggesting high specificity of those two new signs.
A total of 263 samples were analyzed. After conversion to log units, enzyme levels showed a good correlation with gestational week (Pearson). The mean values and the 5th and 95th percentiles were calculated for gestational weeks 16 to 22. Beyond 22 weeks, the number of examinations was insufficient for analysis. On multiple regression analysis, log values of alkaline phosphatase, maternal age, and gestational age independently affected log GGT values. Levels of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were too low, and their correlation with gestational week too poor for calculation of reference values.
Significant differences between the pre-eclampsia subjects and the controls were observed in the gene expressions associated with oxidative stress. Lower values in the pre-eclampsia group were found for heme oxygenase (HO)-1, HO-2, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The HO-1, HO-2 and the catalase levels significantly correlated with proteinuria, and the HO-2 level with systolic blood pressure.
Our analysis revealed 7 different alleles for STR1, 10 for STR13, 7 for STR22 and 9 for STR24. The heterozygosity rate (HR) for STR1, 13, 22 and 24 was 34.6%, 49.6%, 43.6% and 38.2%, respectively. The HR was 75.0% (165/220) when these four markers were combined. Prenatal diagnosis was made for five male foetuses. Four foetuses were identified as affected ones of HA. The STR results were consistent with the data we obtained by PCR of St14 VNTR (DXS52) and DNA sequencing, which showed that one foetus harbours a mutation in exon12 (1804C &gt; T) in FVIII.
Cancer patients were more likely to lose their jobs after cancer diagnosis and were less likely to be re-employed than cancer-free individuals in almost all sex and age groups. Most major cancer sites were also associated with decreased employment status, with the exception of thyroid cancer.
Only four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One of those studies reported a significant improvement compared with a waitlist control group. The relevant gains were found in the overall level of distress, as well as in additional outcome variables such as knowledge of sexual issues, body image and anxiety about psychosexual issues. The remaining studies revealed no significant changes related to psychological distress and psychosocial functioning.
Almost half of the subjects (48.3%) thought their chance of developing gastric cancer was lower than that of other men or women of the same age. A higher level of worry concerning gastric cancer was strongly associated with a higher perceived risk for gastric cancer development. Those who drink alcohol two or more days per week, and who are unmarried all perceived their risk as being higher. However, those without a previous gastric cancer screening, a personal history of gastric disease, or a good overall health status had a lower perceived risk for gastric cancer development.
The mean scores of the treatment decision evaluation's subscales showed that the patient were uncertain about their satisfaction with the treatment decision. The mean score of the symptom inventory suggested that the patients had moderate-level symptoms. Education level, marital status, and the severity symptoms of the independent variables were effective predictors of the treatment decision evaluation. Together the independent variables explained 18.7% of the variance of the satisfaction-uncertainty dimension, 9.1% of the variance of the informed choice dimension, and 16% of the variance of the decision control dimension. Overall the independent variables explained 8.3% of the variance of the treatment decision evaluation.
Correlational and multiple regression analysis revealed that optimism was positively related to EWB. Of the three mediators, self-transcendence alone was found to partially mediate the relationship between optimism and EWB. The relationship between optimism and PFC was not significant. Optimism was related to SS, but its indirect effect on EWB through SS did not reach significance.
Factor analysis of a mammography experience survey yielded four major components including satisfaction with clinic services, physical experience, psychological experience, and communication with clinic staff. Twelve-month and 18-month repeat mammography rates were 37 and 68%, respectively. Logistic regression models found lifetime number of mammograms to predict repeat mammography at 12 and 18 months. In addition, the number of clinical breast exams obtained in the past 5 years predicted repeat mammography at 12 months, while having scheduled a mammography appointment predicted repeat mammography at 18 months.
Of the 395 included families, 42 (10.6%) of parents rated prognosis as excellent or very good for children in whom physicians rated prognosis as poor. In multiple regression analysis, in comparison to parents of children with leukemia and lymphoma, parents of children with solid tumors (odds ratio (OR) 11.3, 95% CI 4.6, 27.8; P=0.0009) and brain tumors (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.7, 21.1; P=0.09), parents of children with relapsed disease (OR 10.7, 95% CI 3.6, 31.3; P&lt;0.0001) and parents with greater dispositional optimism (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.2; P=0.008) were more likely to have optimistic prognostic estimates in the setting of physician-rated poor prognosis.
A total of 30 consecutive patients were recruited. They were treated between November 2001 and May 2005 for (sub)total nasal defects following radical tumour resection. For the control group 99 consented to participate. Social anxiety and avoidance were scored significantly higher within the patient group (p=0.01). Patients cope significantly more passive than controls (p=0.04). Self-esteem levels did not differ significantly between patients and controls (p=0.22). Determinants of satisfaction with nasal reconstruction were self-esteem (p=0.0001), active coping strategy (p=0.001), and passive coping strategy (p=0.0001).
African American and Latino men, and men with less than a high-school education had the highest spirituality scores. Spirituality was significantly associated with general and disease-specific HRQOL. We also found a significant interaction between faith and meaning/peace in the physical and pain domains.
Although the prevalence of neuropsychological deficits significantly decreased as time elapsed after the end of oncological therapy, 21% of our sample group still displayed indications of clinically relevant long-term cognitive deficits. A sub-group of severely affected patients showed specific deficits in verbal-semantic memory and judged their everyday cognitive performance as being extremely poor.
Positive outcomes were found on most items concerning disease-related skills. Remarkable improvements were found with respect to the intervention goals 'social competence' and 'positive thinking'. The parents reported that sharing emotions and experiences with other survivors of childhood cancer was an important element of the OK Onco program, which underscores the benefit of a disease-specific program for cancer survivors.
Patients and partners reported high rates of sexual dysfunction. Within couples, patients' and their partners' sexual function was moderately to highly correlated (r=0.30-0.74). When patients had poor erectile function, their partners were more likely to report that the couple avoided open spousal discussions; this in turn was associated with partners' marital distress (Sobel's Z=12.47, p=0.001). Patients and partners who reported high levels (+1SD) of mutual constructive communication also reported greater marital adjustment, regardless of their own sexual satisfaction. In contrast, greater sexual dissatisfaction was associated with poorer marital adjustment in patients and partners who reported low levels (-1SD) of mutual constructive communication (p&lt;0.05).
Although survivors of childhood cancer do not differ from demographically similar controls in satisfaction with, conflict in, and duration of romantic relationships, they reported fewer romantic relationships and greater distress at relationship end. Within the survivor group, higher trait anxiety, older age at diagnosis, and more severe treatment intensity increased risk for relationship difficulties, including lower relationship satisfaction and more distress at break-up.
H3 agonist R-alpha-methylhistamine and immepip were inactive in rat elevated plus maze test and Vogel type conflict test where diazepam (5 mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic-like effects. Meanwhile, these H3 agonists (10-30 mg/kg) significantly reduced isolation-induced vocalizations in guinea pig pups and isolation-induced aggressive behavior in mouse resident-intruder test. Moreover, in rat conditioned fear stress test, R-alpha-methylhistamine (30 mg/kg) and immepip (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased freezing time, which were completely reversed by concomitant treatment with H3 antagonist, thioperamide (10 mg/kg). In contrast to the limited efficacy obtained with desipramine (30 mg/kg), fluvoxamine (20-60 mg/kg) exhibited anxiolytic-like effects in all the latter three atypical models.
Extended access to cocaine self-administration lead to increased daily intake compared to limited access conditions but did not result in escalated intake over time. However, cocaine- and amphetamine-induced increases in striatal dopamine were diminished as a function of cocaine self-administration history. Surprisingly, there was no effect of drug-taking history on sensitivity to psychostimulant-induced enhancement of startle amplitude.
Repeated AMPH administration increased risky choice 2-3 weeks after drug exposure, whereas these treatments did not alter effort-based decision making in a separate group of animals. However, prior AMPH exposure sensitized the effects of acute AMPH on both forms of decision making, whereby lower doses were effective at inducing "risky" and "lazy" patterns of choice.
Our findings demonstrate significant ATD-induced negative mood exclusively on the second visit of subjects who received both ATD and negative mood induction procedure on their first visit.
We found that the GG/CC genotype group of HTR2A A-1438G/T102C polymorphisms predicts poor aripiprazole response specifically for negative symptoms. In addition, the clinical factors, including dosage of aripiprazole, age, duration of illness, and diagnostic subtype, were found to influence PANSS performance after aripiprazole treatment.
Healthy controls displayed greater prefrontal activation (BA10) to uncued negative pictures compared to patients with MDD. While in healthy controls prefrontal (BA10) activation and BA10-amygdala coupling increased with the number of 5-HTT low-expression risk alleles, this effect was abolished, and even reversed, in patients with MDD. In MDD, connectivity decreased with severity of depressive symptoms (HAMD total score).
Escitalopram treatment was effective at decreasing escape latency times in all ages tested. Desipramine treatment did not decrease escape latency times for PND 21 rats, but did decrease times for PND 28 and adult animals.
Capsazepine increased exploration of open arms in the EPM as well as the number of punished licks in the Vogel conflict test, suggesting anxiolytic-like effects. No changes in the number of entries into the enclosed arms were observed in the EPM, indicating that there were no changes in motor activity. Moreover, capsazepine did not interfere with water consumption or nociceptive threshold, discarding potential confounding factors for the Vogel conflict test.
Once-daily monitoring gained robust experimental control over smoking abstinence. No differences in delay discounting for hypothetical money were observed between the two conditions. Compared to the 1C condition, participants in the 14C condition (1) showed significant increases in the mean percent of delayed hypothetical money over cigarettes choices in the inter-temporal choice task, (2) were significantly less likely to ever choose the smoking option in the direct test of preference for smoking versus money, and (3) reported greater ease of abstaining from smoking and lower nicotine withdrawal and craving.
Our findings show that OBX produces a behavioral phenotype characterized by both anhedonia and exaggerated locomotor activation. Thus, we observed a blunted response to the rewarding properties of amphetamine (1 mg/kg, 21 days post-lesion), a long-lasting reduction in sucrose intake and increased striatal CREB activity. In addition, the same dose of amphetamine, at a coincident time post-lesion, triggered an exaggerated response to its locomotor-stimulant actions.
Atomoxetine speeded SSRT and increased accuracy for go-trials. Citalopram slowed go reaction time and decreased go accuracy at the highest dose (1 mg/kg). GBR-12909 speeded go reaction time and impaired both go and stop accuracy. Guanfacine negatively modulated all principal stop and go measures at the highest dose used (0.3 mg/kg).
In the Wistar rats, WIN produced place aversion only in the adult but not adolescent rats. In contrast, WIN produced CPP in both adolescent and adult SHR rats. The behavioral effects of WIN were CB(1)-mediated and not related to blood pressure.
MDMA (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) did not induce behavioral stimulant effects, but the highest dose of MDMA suppressed responding. Pretreatment with fluoxetine (3.0 mg/kg) or the selective 5HT(2A) antagonist M100907 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the rate suppressing effects of MDMA. In contrast, pretreatment with the selective dopamine transporter inhibitor RTI-177 (0.1 mg/kg) did not alter the rate suppressing effects of MDMA. Administration of MDMA at a dose that suppressed operant behavior had negligible effects on extracellular dopamine. The percent DAT occupancy of MDMA at a dose that suppressed operant behavior also was marginal and reflected low in vivo potency for DAT binding.
An initial locomotor activity assessment demonstrated that all antagonists tested, except the NR2A-subunit preferring antagonist NVP-AAM077, induced hyperactivity, albeit of greatly differing magnitudes, qualities and temporal profiles. Three distinct patterns of antagonist effect were evident from the VI assays used: a uniform decrease in responding produced by (S)-(+)-ketamine, memantine and NVP-AAM077, a uniform increase in responding caused by the NR2B-subunit preferring antagonists Ro 25-6981 and CP 101-606, and variable bidirectional effects of PCP, SDZ 220,581 and MK-801.
Acute treatment with NE-100 dose-dependently (10-30 mg/kg) reduced 1- and 3-h intake of 10% ethanol solution in sP rats, while increasing concurrent water intake and not affecting food intake. NE-100 (17.8-30 mg/kg) comparably reduced intake of the 28% ethanol solution, while not suppressing 1.25% sucrose solution intake, suggesting selectivity of action against ethanol intake. Acute NE-100 (30 mg/kg) also prevented an increase in ethanol intake after a 7-day deprivation period. Repeated, daily NE-100 (30 mg/kg) treatment continued to reduce 24-h ethanol intake across 7 days of administration, with some, but incomplete, tolerance, evident by day 6.
Two hundred and fifty-seven pregnant women (56.2%) with congenital anomalies and 200 (43.8%) without anomalies, confirmed in the postnatal, were included in the study. The average of maternal ages and gestation periods were 24.8+/-6.5 years and 35.9+/-3.7 weeks, respectively. The fetal anomalies were discovered in the central nervous system (50.6%) and genitourinary tract (23.0%). The presence of congenital anomalies were significantly linked with reduced liquid/oligohydramnios (p=0.0002) and increased liquid/polyhydramnios (p&lt;0.0001). Intrauterine mortality was more frequent in the group with anomalies, as compared to the healthy fetuses (10.5 versus 2.5%; p&lt;0.01).
results have shown that the rate of born alive babies, from mothers with school level over primary school and from cesarean sections, presented a spatial pattern visually identifiable and significant spatial self-correlation. Low birth weight, prematurity, Apgar score, number of pre-natal appointments and adolescent mothers have presented a random spatial pattern, showing that, in this analysis scale, those markers have not discriminated the risk groups, despite their unquestionable predictive value for children's morbidity-mortality at individual level. There has been a positive correlation between cesarean section and schooling, and between cesarean section and human development index; and a negative correlation between adolescent mothers and human development index, with statistical significance (p&lt;0.05).
the most prevalent species found was Candida albicans (87%, S and 67%, A) followed by Candida glabrata (4%, S e 17% A). The number of women reporting the use of contraceptives was higher among the symptomatic, 77%. In the two groups studied, about 87% of the women presented regular menstrual cycles and 57% were married with ages between 30 to 40 years old. Concerning the sexual practices, there has been concomitance among anal, oral and vaginal habits from the patients. Only Candida albicans produced the virulence factor phospholipase in 37.5% of them. Proteinase has been detected in Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis. This latter virulence factor was mainly associated to isolates from symptomatic patients.
at the second post-surgical evaluation, there was no significant difference between the two groups, concerning the variables analyzed. After one-year follow-up, from a total of 97 patients, 81 were continent and 16, non-continent, BMI and height being different between the groups. In the continent group, average BMI was 27.1 and height, 1.57 m, and, among the non-continent, 30.8 (p=0.02) and 1.52 m (p=0.01). The BMI&gt;30 Odds Ratio was 3.7 (CI95%=1.2-11.5).
eight-three lactobacillus strains were isolated and identified, L. crispatus (30.1%), L. jensenii (26.5%), L. gasseri (22.9%) e L. vaginalis (8.4%), being the prevalent species. Only 20 of those isolates did not present H2O2 production, in detectable amounts. From the 37 strains selected for the test of adhesion to the epithelial cells, 12 presented 50 to 69% of adhesion, 10 presented 70% or more, and the remaining, little or no adhesion at all. None of the tested strains produced bacteriocins.
no significant difference has been found in the comparison of groups, concerning age, menarche, menopause, parity and body mass index. It has been seen that 67.2% of the women were married, 83.2% had attended primary school and 53.2% were housewives, with no difference between the groups. HT users reported lower frequency of climacteric symptoms (BKMI) with moderate and marked intensity, as compared to non-users (p&lt;0.001). Even though HT users presented lower average score in cognitive deficit (p&lt;0.001), vasomotor symptoms (p=0.04), sleeping problems (p&lt;0.001), attractiveness (p=0.02) from the WHQ, there has been no difference in the total score, as compared to non-users.
The most frequently used coping strategies are presented in descending order: accepting responsibility, self-control and distancing. There was a positive correlation between the confrontive coping strategy and the total score on the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (rs = 0.146; p = 0.045) and the score on Factor 1 (rs = 0.165; p = 0.023).
Considering possible values between -17 and +21, professionals scored 11.5 +/- 3.8 in the Attitudes scale. These values correspond to more empathic attitudes. Scores in the Knowledge on Drugs Scale were 55.2 +/- 12.5 (possible values: 0 to 100). Correlation between the Attitudes Scale and the time spent working as education professionals was -0.288 (p &lt; 0.01). The difference in the means in the Attitude Scale according to professional academic qualifications was statistically significant (-1.93, t = 2.26; gl = 80; p &lt; 0.05).
The suicides of the period between 1979 and 2003 numbered 11,434 cases. Differences were observed in suicides occurring in Spring and Autumn for the total sample (ANOVA: p-value = 0.01), and in the male sample (ANOVA: p-value = 0.02). For the analysis of time series, seasonality was significant only for the period of 7 months in the male sample (p-value = 0.04).
The lifetime diagnosis of depression (p = 0.001; OR = 4.9; 95% CI, 1.9-12.7) predicts illegal drugs dependence. Sociodemographic variables such as male gender (p &lt; 0.001; OR = 36.8; 95% CI, 11.8-114) and occupational situation (p = 0.002; OR = 5.0; 95% CI, 1.8-13) as well as alcohol dependence (p = 0.01; OR = 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-8.7) significantly influenced depression and drug dependence. Additional influent factors detected were having parents (p = 0.006; OR = 18.9; 95% CI, 2.3-158) or friends (p &lt; 0.001; OR = 64.4; 95% CI, 6.5-636) who are illicit drugs dependents.
We found that depressed patients have a lifetime history of more suicide attempts. However, univariate analysis of number of suicide attempts showed that the best model fits the bipolar II subtype (mean square = 15.022; p = 0.010) and lifetime history of psychotic episodes (mean square = 17.359; p = 0.021). Subgrouping the suicide attempts by subtype (violent or non-violent) revealed that manic/hypomanic patients had a greater tendency toward attempting violent suicide (21.2 vs. 14.7%, X(2) = 7.028, p = 0.03). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed this result.
The physical component presented higher quality of life medians than the mental component. Comparisons between the three years showed that in almost all domains the quality of life scores of the second year residents were higher than the first year residents (p &lt; 0.01). The mental component scores remained high for third year residents (p &lt; 0.01). Predictors of higher quality of life were: second or third year of residency, satisfaction with the training program, sufficient time for leisure, and care of critical patients for less than 30 hours per week.
the overall DUI prevalence reported in the sample was 34.7% - 42.5% among males and 9.2% among females. Being male (OR = 6.0, 95% CI 2.9-12.6), having a previous DUI accident (OR = 7.9, 95% CI 2.5-24.9), binging in the last year (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.03-4.5) and having an unfavorable opinion towards policies (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.2) remained associated with heavy drinking and driving after model adjustments.
There were no differences in genotypic distributions between patients and controls (chi2 = 0.98; 2 d.f.; p = 0.61).
The percentage of non-perseverative errors was significantly higher among patients with the val/val genotype. There was no association between (BNDF) genotype frequency and other Wisconsin Card Sorting Test domains.
The control group was slightly older than the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group (p = 0.07); IQ and schooling did not differ between groups (p = 0.34 and p = 0.38, respectively). While performing a test requiring sustained attention for a longer period of time, the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group showed a significantly higher number of commission errors compared to the controls, thus presenting sustained attention deficits (p = 0.003); when the influence of IQ, age and schooling was reduced, the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group also made more omission errors during a sustained attention task in comparison to the control group, thus achieving a borderline significance level (p = 0.08); the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group also performed worse in Digit Span forward and backward (p = 0.013 and p = 0.01, respectively) and in Arithmetic (p = 0.008). Other scores did not achieve significance.
Clinical trials have revealed that rimonabant may promote weight loss in obese patients, although it may also induce symptoms of anxiety and depression.
There were found eight studies that met inclusion criteria adopted for the present work. These studies showed that systematized physical activity contributed to at least improve temporarily some cognitive functions of patients with Alzheimer's disease, particularly, attention, executive functions and language.
Euthymic bipolar disorder presented impairment in recognizing disgust and fear. Manic BD showed difficult to recognize fearful and sad faces. Pediatric bipolar disorder patients and children at risk presented impairment in their capacity to recognize emotions in adults and children faces. Bipolar disorder patients were more accurate in recognizing facial emotions than schizophrenic patients.
NBL was measured in 7543 fetuses, of which 7517 were euploid. The best fit equation for median NBL in euploid fetuses in relation to CRL was: NBL (mm) = 0.4593 + (0.0186 x CRL(mm)). The NBL for gestational age (GA, in days) was given by the equation NBL(mm) = 0.2392 + (0.0027 x GA). There was no correlation between log(10)(NBL multiples of the median (MoM)) and log(10)(NT MoM) in unaffected pregnancies (r = - 0.009; P = 0.43). Only two of the 11 cases with trisomy 21 had an NBL outside the 5(th) or 95(th) centiles of the reference range for euploid fetuses.
In all cases there were associated abnormalities: macrocephaly, ventriculomegaly, vermian agenesis, abnormal sulcation or encephalocele. Four pregnancies were terminated and in each of these cases the autopsy confirmed dysmorphic features and additional brain abnormalities. Five infants were delivered; two died shortly after birth, one suffers from mental retardation, one had neonatal convulsions and one is developing normally.
We found a linear relationship between gestational age and telencephalon thickness (R(2) = 51.9%, P &lt; 0.0001), diencephalon thickness (R(2) = 62.2%, P &lt; 0.0001), mesencephalon thickness (R(2) = 59.2%, P &lt; 0.0001) and rhombencephalon thickness (R(2) = 47.8%, P = 0.0043). There was also a linear relationship between crown-rump length and telencephalon thickness (R(2) = 55.0%, P &lt; 0.0001), diencephalon thickness (R(2) = 59.6%, P &lt; 0.0001), mesencephalon thickness (R(2) = 55.0%, P &lt; 0.0001) and rhombencephalon thickness (R(2) = 52.3%, P = 0.0025).
Fetal heart rate (FHR) accelerations, short- and long-term variation overall, duration of episodes of high and low variation and variation in high episodes increased with advancing gestation. In contrast, maternal perception of fetal movements, basal FHR, variation in low episodes and the time until criteria for normality were met decreased with advancing gestation. Gestational age-related changes in FHR variation were less evident at the lowest percentiles. Episodes of high FHR variation were detected in most fetuses, even at 25 weeks. Opposite trends of basal FHR and variation were observed at 42 weeks. Large decelerations and the frequency and duration of low episodes were also higher at 42 weeks.
Left and right S' increased with gestational age in normal pregnancy. Fetuses with IUGR and CPR had lower left ventricular S' than normal fetuses (mean, 2.41 (95% CI, 1.96-2.86) cm/s vs. 3.30 (95% CI, 3.05-3.55) cm/s; P = 0.0006). This reduction in S' correlated with the grade of UA flow abnormality (P = 0.0002). Fetuses with reversed diastolic UA flow had significantly lower left S' (mean, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4-2.6) cm/s; P = 0.001) than normal fetuses. There was no correlation between left S' and MCA pulsatility index (P = 0.37) in the IUGR-CPR group, but there was a reduction in S' approaching statistical significance in fetuses with reversed DV flow in comparison to those without it (P = 0.09). Right S' was similar in the two study groups and did not correlate with worsening UA flow class. All fetuses with a left S' below 1.6 cm/s and reversed UA flow died in the perinatal period.
We received 276 (60%) responses to the questionnaire. Only 31.9% of health professionals had an approach that facilitated obtaining true consent from their patients and respected the ethical principles of competence and patient autonomy; 46% were in favor of the screening test and adopted an autonomy-oriented approach but were poorly informed; and 15.4% had a directive-authoritarian approach combined with poor knowledge. Regression analysis showed that two independent factors (speciality (P = 0.031) and location of practice (P = 0.034)) affected the level of medical knowledge, and two independent factors (location of practice (P = 0.034) and the type of medical practice i.e. public or private (P &lt; 0.05)) affected the opinion of health professionals about the screening test. Two independent factors (speciality (P &lt; 0.001) and the age of the health professional (P = 0.02)) affected the attitudes of health professionals towards their patients.
None of the 125 vaginally delivered women had a visible scar in the uterus, whereas all women who had undergone Cesarean section had at least one visible scar. Median myometrial thickness at the level of the isthmus was 11.6 mm in women who had only been delivered vaginally, and 8.3 mm, 6.7 mm and 4.7 mm in women who had undergone one, two and at least three Cesarean sections, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Scar defects were seen in 61% (66/108), 81% (35/43) and 100% (11/11) of the women who had undergone one, two and at least three Cesarean sections (P = 0.002); at least one defect was classified as large by the ultrasound examiner in 14% (15/108), 23% (10/43) and 45% (5/11) (P = 0.027), and at least one total defect was seen in 6% (7/108), 7% (3/43) and 18% (2/11) (P = 0.336). In women who had undergone one Cesarean section, the median distance between an intact scar and the internal cervical os was 4.6 (range, 0-19) mm, and that between a deficient scar and the internal cervical os was 0 (range, 0-26) mm (P &lt; 0.001).
The miscarriage rates were 1.4% (95% CI, 1.3-1.5) after amniocentesis and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.7-2.0) after CVS. The postprocedural loss rate for both procedures did not change during the 11-year study period, and was not correlated with maternal age. The number of procedures a department performed had a significant effect on the risk of miscarriage. In departments performing fewer than 500 amniocenteses, the odds ratio for fetal loss was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.6-3.1) when compared to departments performing more than 1500 procedures during the 11-year period. For CVS the risk of miscarriage was 40% greater in departments performing 500-1000 and 1001-1500 as compared to those performing more than 1500 procedures.
At 7 days after misoprostol treatment, 1870 women (84.7%) had endometrial thickness assessed. Thirty of these women (1.6%) subsequently underwent D&amp;C. The mean endometrial thickness was 14.5 mm for women who underwent D&amp;C and 10.9 mm for those who did not (difference 3.5 mm (95% CI, 1.8-5.3 mm)). Endometrial thickness was poorly predictive of the need for D&amp;C, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.65. All endometrial thickness thresholds had positive predictive values of 25% or less. The results were unchanged by adjustment of endometrial thickness values by multivariable modeling.
There were 77 women included in the study and nine (12%) of these had a single fetal loss. Pregnancies with subsequent single fetal loss were more likely to have a larger median CRL discrepancy (42.0%; interquartile range (IQR), 23.8-64.3%) than were those which retained two viable fetuses (6.1%; IQR, 2.2-12.5%) (P &lt; 0.0001). The median CRL discrepancy in subsequently viable monochorionic diamniotic twins (10.9%; IQR, 1.9-17.5%) was no different from that in dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies (5.9%; IQR, 2.1-12.3%) (P = 0.305). Regardless of chorionicity, there was a relationship between increasing CRL discrepancy and single fetal loss; the likelihood of a subsequently viable twin pregnancy was 97% if the discrepancy was &lt; 20%, while if the discrepancy was &gt; 60% there were no cases of both twins remaining viable (P &lt; 0.0001). Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis of CRL discrepancy in predicting single fetal loss gave an area under the curve of 0.93, with an optimum cut-off point of 16.9% discrepancy (sensitivity, 88.9%; 95% CI, 51.8-99.7; and specificity, 86.7%; 95% CI, 76.3-93.8).
The study population consisted of 19 614 pregnancies with a normal karyotype or delivery of a phenotypically normal baby (euploid group) and 122 cases of trisomy 21. In the euploid fetuses the NT was above the previously defined 50(th), 95(th) and 99(th) centiles in 10 033 (51.2%), 618 (3.2%) and 123 (0.6%) cases and the respective values for trisomy 21 were 117 (95.9%), 94 (77.0%) and 57 (46.7%). The median fetal NT was within 0.1 mm of the expected in 47 (78.3%) of the 60 sonographers and within 0.2 mm in all. In the euploid fetuses the median free beta-hCG was 1.0 (range, 0.1-29.4) multiples of the median (MoM) and the median PAPP-A was 1.0 (range, 0.2-3.3) MoM. The median MoM values were 1.0 or close to 1.0 MoM for each subgroup of pregnancy characteristics, including gestations of 11, 12 and 13 weeks, maternal weight of &lt; 60 kg, 60-80 kg and &gt; 80 kg, different ethnic origins, cigarette smokers and non-smokers, natural conception and in vitro fertilization. For a false-positive rate of 3%, the detection rate of trisomy 21 in screening by maternal age and fetal NT was 81% (95% CI, 73-89%), by maternal age and maternal serum biochemistry it was 63% (95% CI, 56-72%) and by combined screening based on maternal age, fetal NT and maternal serum biochemistry it was 90% (95% CI, 84-96%).
No statistical difference between the BEEC patients and the control group was observed in the anteroposterior diameter or the area of the levator hiatus, or in the maximal thickness of the levator muscle. However, significantly greater values were observed in BEEC patients in the transverse diameter of the levator hiatus (mean, 4.31 vs. 3.81 cm, P = 0.046) and in the levator angle (mean, 80.1 vs. 70.0 degrees, P = 0.040). The measurements obtained in the control group were consistent with those previously reported in the literature.
Significant differences were found between groups for E'/A' at the IVS (P &lt; 0.001) and LV (P = 0.009), with a higher mean (+/- SD) value in Group 1 (IVS: 0.92 +/- 0.28; LV: 0.85 +/- 0.19) than in Groups 2 (IVS: 0.62 +/- 0.09; LV: 0.68 +/- 0.14) and 3 (IVS: 0.71 +/- 0.14; LV: 0.69 +/- 0.15). In the RV, there was no statistically significant difference in the E'/A' ratio (P = 0.2). No differences were observed for mitral and tricuspid flow velocities and ratios.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that advanced maternal age (odds ratio (OR), 5.4; 95% CI, 1.8-16.4), previous Cesarean section (OR, 20.4; 95% CI, 4.0-105.2) and sponge-like findings in the cervix (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.8-17.0) were associated with massive bleeding (&gt; 2500 mL). Placental adherence occurred in five cases and was more frequent in cases where the placenta was located at the site of the scar of a previous Cesarean section (OR, 123.1; 95% CI, 4.5-3395.2) and where there was lack of a clear zone (OR, 48.0; 95% CI, 3.8-604.7).
Among 167 consecutive patients with an IUD evaluated using the 3D reconstructed coronal view, 28 (16.8%) had an IUD with side arms abnormally located within the myometrium. The abnormal positioning of the IUD arms was only detected using the 3D coronal view. A higher proportion of patients with an abnormally located IUD presented with bleeding (35.7%) or pain (39.3%) compared with those with normally positioned IUDs (15.1% with bleeding and 19.4% with pain) (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Seventy-five percent of patients with an abnormally located IUD presented with bleeding or pain compared with 34.5% of those whose IUD was normally placed (P = 0.0001). Twenty of 21 patients with an abnormally located IUD presenting with pelvic pain or bleeding reported improvement in their symptoms after IUD removal.
The CVI cyst appeared as a well-defined anechoic lesion without adjacent mass effect. In all fetuses the cyst was single and in two cases it enlarged slightly during pregnancy. The cyst was isolated in three fetuses and associated with borderline ventriculomegaly in two. A single umbilical artery was the only associated extracranial anomaly and this was detected in only one fetus. Neurosonography confirmed the presence of CVI cysts in all cases after delivery. During postnatal follow-up (range 10-48 months), the cyst regressed in one case within 1 month after delivery while the size of the others remained stable. No infant developed psychomotor disorders.
During a 3-year period, 4250 women were assessed by transvaginal sonography, of whom 293 (6.9%) were diagnosed with Cesarean scar defects. Eighty-six patients were excluded due to other uterine pathologies. Altogether, 207 patients with Cesarean scar defects were included in this study. Women who had undergone multiple Cesarean sections tended to have larger scar defects (in width and depth) than did those who had undergone a single Cesarean section. Women with retroflexed uteri also tended to have wider defects than those with anteflexed uteri. Defect width was significantly greater in women with postmenstrual spotting, dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain.
In our population of 24 triplet pregnancies, 13 had cervical shortening. Of these, 54% underwent cervical cerclage at a mean gestational age of 20 weeks. Overall, patients without cervical shortening delivered on average 17 days later than those with cervical shortening (32 + 2 weeks vs. 29 + 6 weeks, P = 0.034). Moreover, infants of patients without cervical shortening weighed on average 456 g more at birth than did those with cervical shortening (1751 g vs. 1295 g, P = 0.039) and had a lower percentage of very low birth weight infants (30.3% vs. 69.2%, P = 0.002). Within the subset of patients with cervical shortening, there was no statistical difference in any of the outcomes studied between patients who underwent cervical cerclage and those who did not.
Chromosomal regional gain and loss were found in 15 and 13 of 16 EDM cases respectively including totally 24 regional gains and 19 regional losses in all the tumors studied. Both regional gains and losses were mostly seen in myxopapillary EDMs (MPE, WHO grade I), more commonly seen in cellular EDMs (CE, WHO grade II) and tanycytic EDMs (TE, WHO grade II) than in anaplastic EDMs (AE, WHO grade III). Some of the regional gains and losses appeared only in one subtype of MPE, CE, TE and AE cases resulting in development of specific imbalance profiles of certain subtype in these cases. MPE, CE and TE often had +7. Chromosomal +5 occurred only in MPE and CE, and -22q was only seen in CE and TE. AE frequently had +1q, but none had +5, +7, -4q, -19q and -22q. The frequencies of any regional gain or loss were not affected by patients' genders (P &gt; 0.05). Chromosomal +1q and +7p happened predominantly in intracranial EDMs with an averagely onset age of &lt;or= 30 years, and +7 was only detected in spinal EDMs of patients over 30 years old, the differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).
The mean age of seizure onset and duration of disease were 14.3-year-old and 8.6 years, respectively. Abnormal signals were observed in 94.3% of cases (33/35) by magnetic resonance imaging. The histologic types of brain tumors included ganglioglioma (13/35, WHO grade I and 6/35, WHO grade II), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (3/35, WHO grade I), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (3/35, WHO grade II), diffuse astrocytoma (1/35, WHO grade II), oligoastrocytoma (1/35, WHO grade II), angiocentric glioma (1/35, WHO grade I) and meningioangiomatosis (1/35). The 6 remaining cases showed features seen in between glioneuronal hamartoma and mixed neuronal-glial tumor. Most of these tumors were located in the temporal lobe (27/35) and associated with focal cortical dysplasia. Immunohistochemical study showed a remarkable expression of CD34 in gangliogliomas.
In comparing with that of the control group, there were differences in the degree of contusion lesion, reactive astrocytosis, edema and pathologic changes of neuronal cells present in the brain stem injury group and was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). The axons locating in the brain stem injury group showed a distinctive histology by the appearance of significantly larger diameters (P &lt; 0.05).
ONB consisted of small round tumor cells growing in nests or lobules separated by fibrovascular septa. Characteristically, there were neurofibrillary intercellular matrices and Homer-Wright or Flexner-Wintersteiner rosette formation. The unusual structures including epithelial components such as mucous or squamous cell nests which were found in 45.0% (18/40), and 15.0% (6/40) respectively. In addition, 3 cases showed an in-situ form with invasion of tumor into olfactory epithelium, and there was exogenous papillary proliferation seen in 2 cases. Log-rank survival analysis demonstrated that Hyams Grading had no statistical correlation with the prognosis. The presence of necrosis was correlated with a poor prognosis (P = 0.016) while the presence of mucous cells was correlated with a good prognosis (P = 0.011).
Two cases were located in the orbit, one of which had recurred. Five cases were located in the extraorbital regions. Histologically, the tumors were well-circumscribed and composed of non-atypical, round to spindle cells with collagen deposition in the stroma. The tumors had prominent vasculatures and in areas, pseudovascular spaces lined by multinucleated giant cells lining which were also present in the stroma. Immunohistochemically, both neoplastic cells and multinucleate giant cells expressed CD34. Seven patients underwent tumor excision and were well and without tumor recurrence upon the clinical follow-up.
Amongst the 29 cases of AITL studied, 75.9% (22/29) showed aberrant expression of CD10, while all except one of the controlled cases were negative, 82.8% (24/29) of the AITL cases expressed CXCL13, while all cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified were negative. As for bcl-6 staining, although the highest percentage of bcl-6-positive cells was observed in AITL, the expression pattern was not useful in differentiating AITL from peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified and lymphoid reaction. Besides, all cases of AITL demonstrated the characteristic proliferation of follicular dendritic cells. Two of the cases, which contained obvious germinal centers, had the follicular dendritic cell meshwork extending beyond the lymphoid follicles.
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the frequencies of Shh, Ihh, Ptch and Smo expression were rare in normal cervical epithelium, but were strongly expressed in cervical cancer and its precursor lesions (CINII/III) (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.05, respectively). In cervical cancer, the expression rate of Shh (95%) was higher than that of CIN (CINI to CINIII) (46.4%, 61.1%, 80.0%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). HPV16 was positive in 77.5% of SCC. In cervical cancer, the expression of Shh was related with HPV16 infection (P &lt; 0.05), and the expression of Smo was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05).
AZT inhibited telomerase activity of TJ905 cells. Cyclin A expression levels in the cells treated with 50 and 100 micromol/L AZT were significantly lower than controls (P &lt; 0.01), and down-regulation of the expression was in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Compared with controls, G(0)/G(1) phase cells were obviously decreased (P &lt; 0.05 approximately 0.01) and S phase cells significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05 approximately 0.01) after treatment with 50, 100 and 200 micromol/L AZT. The cell numbers of G(0)/G(1) and S phases at the 1st generation of above three treated groups changed in a dose-dependent manner, whereas S phase cells increases in all AZT treatment groups and G(0)/G(1) phase cell decrease in group treated with 50 micromol/L AZT were also in a time-dependent manner. Both the apoptotic cells of the 1st and 6th generations of all AZT treatment groups were significantly more than controls (P &lt; 0.05 approximately 0.01), their numbers of the 6th generations of the three groups increased with AZT concentration (P &lt; 0.05 approximately 0.01), and all of them were more than the 1st and 3rd generations of the same dosage group (P &lt; 0.05 approximately 0.01). Colony formation efficiencies and Ki-67 labeling indexes of the three AZT treatment groups were distinctly lower than controls (P &lt; 0.01), and they were also decreased with the elevation of AZT concentration and/or the elongation of the incubating time. The difference of any above parameter had no significance among the 1st, 3rd and 6th generations of control group (P &gt; 0.05).
Two of the cases studied were unsatisfactory for diagnosis, with no epithelial cells identified. One hundred and thirty-seven smears were diagnosed as "negative", 45 of which subsequently confirmed to be malignant (negative predictive value = 60.2%). Six of the 11 cases with "low-grade atypia" were proven to be malignant (positive predictive value = 54.5%), as compared to 19 of 23 cases of "high-grade atypia" (positive predictive value = 86.4%). All of the 41 cases with cytologic diagnosis of "malignancy" were confirmed to be malignant (positive predictive value = 100%). The cytologic features of malignancy in ERCP-guided brushing preparations included overlapping nuclei, anisonucleosis, coarse chromatin pattern, poor cellular cohesion, tumor diathesis, prominent nucleoli and atypical mitotic figures.
Regressed follicles were evident in 7.8% (9/115) of AITL cases, 6.7% (2/30) of PTCL, NOS cases and 83.3% (25/30) of RH cases, respectively. A marked increase of number of arborizing venules was shown in 98.3% (113/115) of AITL cases, 63.3% (19/30) of PTCL, NOS cases and 76.7% (23/30) of RH cases, respectively. In lymph nodes with paracortical hyperplasia, the expression of CXCL13, CD10 and bcl-6 were restricted to the germinal centers. In AITL, 96.5% (111/115) of cases showed CXCL13 expression, in contrast to 26.7% (8/30) of PTCL, NOS. Expression of CD10 and bcl-6 were found in the neoplastic cells in 50.4% (58/115) and 78.3% (90/115) of AITL, and 3.3% (1/30) and 3.3% (1/30) of PTCL, NOS, respectively. Irregular meshworks of CD21-positive follicular dendritic cells were found in all the AITL cases. Clonal TCR-gamma rearrangement was detected in 83% (83/100) of the AITL cases.
In the 73 cases studied, 16 cases (21.9%) belonged to GCB subtype and 57 cases (78.1%) belonged to non-GCB subtype. Breakage of 3q27 was detected in 11 of the 54 cases (20.4%) and proliferation was detected in 14 cases (25.9%). The five-year overall survival rate of GCB subtype was significantly higher than that of non-GCB subtype (78% versus 40%, P = 0.011). The bcl-6-positive cases had a better clinical outcome than that of the bcl-6-negative cases (P = 0.041). Breakage of 3q27 predicted a worse overall survival.
The male-to-female ratio was 1.89:1. The median age of the patients was 38 years. The commonest sites of involvement included nasal cavity and adjoining tissue (85.5%). Histologically, EN-NK/TCL was composed of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells. Angiocentric and angiodestructive growth patterns, coagulative tumor necrosis and apoptotic bodies were frequently observed. Immunohistochemical study showed that CD20, the B-cell marker, was negative in all cases. The positivity rates for T-cell markers CD3epsilon, CD4, CD5 and CD8 were 100% (49/49), 7% (3/46), 8% (4/48) and 63% (29/46), respectively. Most cases were also positive for NK-cell marker CD56 (79% 42/53). All cases expressed cytotoxic granule-associated proteins TIA-1 and granzyme B. Only 17% (8/46) of the cases were positive for anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. The proliferation index, as demonstrated by Ki-67 immunostain, varied: 30% (14/47) with a low Ki-67 expression level (&lt; or = 29%), 28% (13/47) with a medium level (30%-59%) and 42% with a high level (&gt; or = 60%). There was a significant positive correlation between the bcl-2 positive expression and a high Ki-67 expression level. In-situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA was positive in all cases. Amongst the 41 cases with clinical information available, 63.4% presented with Ann Arbor stage I to II. The performance status score was 1 in 87.8% cases. High lactate dehydrogenase level was demonstrated in some patients (31.8%). Amongst the 27 cases with follow-up data available, the median survival was 13 months. The overall 1-year, 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 52%, 31% and 20%, respectively. In general, cases with high proliferation index carried poor prognosis.
The median age of the patients was 61.5 years (range: 36 to 75 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1. All cases presented with massive splenomegaly. Five of six cases had abnormal blood counts: neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with two of them showing anemia. After splenectomy, the blood counts in 3/3 cases returned to normal levels. Post-operative fludarabine-based chemotherapy was given to 3 patients, two of them achieved complete remission and 1 case died during the course of chemotherapy. The average survival time was 21.5 months (range: 6 to 60 months). Histologically, all of the 8 cases showed micronodular white pulp lesions. Six of them exhibited the classic biphasic appearance with central aggregates of small B cells rimmed by a peripheral zone of atypical monocytoid B cells. The remaining 2 cases had a monomorphous appearance, consisting mainly of atypical monocytoid B cells. There was infiltration of tumor cells in the red pulp, sheets in appearance in all 8 cases. Immuno-histochemical staining showed CD20-positive (8/8), IgD-positive in 2 of the 4 cases (2/4), CD5-positive in 1 of the 4 cases (1/4), 6 of the 6 cases were bcl-2-positive, cyclin D1-negative and bcl-6/CD10-negative, CD43-negative in 5 of the 6 cases (5/6). The proliferation index, as highlighted by Ki-67 immunostaining, was low (&lt; 15%).
The median age of the patients was 53 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.57:1 in lymphoma group. All of the lymphoma patients presented with superficial lymphadenopathy, with (8/18) or without B symptoms. Histologically, the lymphoma was characterized by follicles of various sizes and shapes. The T zones were expanded by medium-sized lymphoma cells which contained clear cytoplasm and irregular nuclei. Mitotic figures were commonly identified. Immunohistochemical study confirmed that the lymphoma cells were of T-lineage. The proliferative index, as highlighted by Ki-67, was higher [average = (38.24 +/- 13.42)%/mm2] than that in the control group. T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was demonstrated in 71.4% (10/14) of the lymphoma cases.
Positive detection rates by the BIOMED-2 multiplex tubes TCRgamma(A+B) and the universal primers (T(VG)/T(JX)) were 76.4% and 60.0%, respectively. There were not statistical difference between the methods (P &gt; 0.05).
Characteristic features of acute encephalitis were seen in the brain, with most prominent lesions found in the brain stem in both cases. Inflammatory cells were largely CD68-positive microglia with a few CD15-positive neutrophils in the areas of neuronal necrosis. The 5'-untranslated region of EV71 was detected in the medulla by RT-PCR using paraffin-embedded tissues of both cases. Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR products showed 100% homology to the EV71 strain, recently submitted to the GenBank database from Fuyang, Anhui province.
Western blot and RT-PCR showed a baseline low level of expression of KISS-1 protein (0.715 +/- 0.109) and mRNA (0.670 +/- 0.176) in EC-1 cells. pcDNA3.1-KISS-1 expression vector was successfully transfected into EC-1 cells. Western blot and RT-PCR showed that the expression of KISS-1 protein (1.143 +/- 0.218) and mRNA (0.877 +/- 0.162) in EC-1 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-KISS-1 were significantly higher than those transfected with the control vector pcDNA3.1 (0.745 +/- 0.130, 0.685 +/- 0.128; t = 3.850, 2.481, P &lt; 0.05) and the control cells (0.855 +/- 0.184, 0.677 +/- 0.138; t = 2.275, 2.306, P &lt; 0.05). Boyden chamber analysis showed that the invasiveness of the cells transfected with KISS-1 at 24 h (91.8 +/- 11.7), 48 h (117.8 +/- 11.1) and 72 h (139.2 +/- 11.8) were significantly reduced than that of the cells transfected with the control vector pcDNA3.1 (118.1 +/- 14.7, 141.7 +/- 13.2, 162.2 +/- 22.7; t = 3.153, 4.215, 3.569, P &lt; 0.01) and the control cells (112.2 +/- 15.6, 138.1 +/- 13.0, 162.3 +/- 14.0; t = 4.154, 3.797, 2.702, P &lt; 0.05). MTT showed that the proliferation potential of cells after transfection with KISS-1 at 48 h (0.517 +/- 0.127) and 72 h (0.394 +/- 0.137) were significantly reduced than that of cells transfected with the control vector pcDNA3.1 (0.636 +/- 0.186, 0.513 +/- 0.150; t = 2.054, 2.709, P &lt; 0.05) and the control cells (0.646 +/- 0.135, 0.511 +/- 0.153; t = 2.276, 2.205, P &lt; 0.05). Clone formation assay suggested that cells transfected with KISS-1 (157.2 +/- 36.4) showed significantly decreased clone formation than cells transfected with the control vector pcDNA3.1 (236.3 +/- 78.1; t = 3.441, P &lt; 0.01) and the control cells (242.5 +/- 48.6; t = 2.250, P &lt; 0.05).
Tiam1 over expression significantly increased the abilities of adhesion, migratory and invasion of C666-1 and CNE1 cells, comparing with that of the control untransfected cells (P &lt; 0.05).
C-myc protein immunoreactivity was detected in 91 percentage of FD (P = 0.001). Compared with the negative control group, the difference was significant. P16 positive was detected in 34 FD cases (P = 0.001). The difference was significant as compared with the positive control group. Positive p53 protein expression was detected in the only 1 case of fibrous dysplasia with malignant transformation. PCR amplification was successful in 12 of 35 FD cases. Two of the 12 FD cases were detected to have GNAS1 gene mutation, in which 1 case was FD of Mazabraud syndrome, 1 case was a monostotic lesion.
One patient was female and 4 were male. Ages of the patients ranged from 19 to 46 years. The sites of the tumor involvement were vulvar (2 cases), hypogastric zone (1 case), anterosuperior iliac spine (1 case) and buttock (1 case). Clinically, the tumor masses were painless and progressive solitary nodules. Microscopically, the tumor cell growth was infiltrative in nature, nodular in appearance with degenerative and necrotic cells at the central areas. The tumors consisted of relatively uniform epithelioid cells with round or oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin (5/5), CK (4/5), EMA (4/5), beta-catenin (3/5), CD34 (3/5), and S-100 protein (1/5), but were negative for SMA, MyoD1, Desmin, HMB-45, CK7 and CK20.
The patients consisted of six males and three females with ages ranging from 11 to 65 years (mean 31.4 years). Clinically, most cases presented as slowly growing painless masses located in the extremities, trunk and neck. Two cases had a history of a rapid recent enlargement. Three cases presented with recurrent diseases after incomplete resection. Ultrasound showed heterogeneous signal. Precontrast CT and T1-weighted MRI showed a nodular mass of low to isodensity, while contrast-enhanced CT and T2-weighted MRI demonstrated contrasting zonal areas of hypo/hyperintensity. The tumors measured 3 to 16 cm (mean 7.7 cm), with a fibrous to myxoid appearance on cut surface. Histologically, they were composed of alternating collagenous and myxoid areas. A transition between the two areas could be identified. Giant rosette-like structures were observed in 3 cases. The center of the giant rosettes was composed of eosinophilic collagen, which showed centrifugal in arrangement. There was also gradual transition between the giant rosettes and the fibromyxoid component. On high magnification, the tumor was composed of ovoid to spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Nuclear atypia was inconspicuous. The tumor cells were arranged mostly in interlacing fascicles or whorls. Vessels were not prominent and necrosis was absent. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed unique staining for vimentin, consistent with a fibroblastic differentiation.
All the tumours were primarily located in the vertebrae (including 9 cases in thoracic vertebrae and 4 cases in lumbar vertebrae). The male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1. The age of the patients ranged from 42 to 69 years (mean age = 56 years). The commonest symptom was pain in the surrounding regions. The degree of neurologic disturbance mostly depended on the extent of vertebral destruction and structural instability of the spine. Radiologic examination showed mainly osteolytic lesions in vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of heterogeneous intensity inside the involved vertebrae (low in T1 weighted and high in T2 weighted images). Histologic examination showed diffuse infiltration by malignant cells. In well-differentiated plasmacytomas, the tumor cells resembled normal plasma cells. In poorly differentiated examples, the cellular morphology mimicked that of the centroblasts. The interstitial stroma was scanty and contained plenty of vessels, sometimes with formation of blood lakes. Amyloid deposition was present in some of the cases. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were positive for CD79a and negative for CD20. Light chain restriction was detected in all the 13 cases studied. Plasma cell marker PC was expressed in all cases, while IgG was positive in 5 cases, IgM in 1 case, MUM1 in 10 cases and CD138 in 8 cases. Ki-67 index varied from 10% to 50%. All cases were operated, with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy given.
Thirteen cases of MGCT were found amongst a total of 603 cases of giant cell tumor encountered. Six of the 13 cases represented concurrent malignancy in giant cell tumor while the remaining 7 cases was malignant transformation in recurrent giant cell tumor. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 71 years (mean age = 39.5 years) in the first group and from 27 to 52 years (mean age = 36.7 years) in the second group. In concurrent MGCT, a high-grade sarcoma component was present in conjunction with the giant cell tumor component. In malignant transformation of recurrent giant cell tumor, the original tumor was giant cell tumor and the recurrence showed features reminiscent of malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
Basal-like breast cancers constituted 17.0% of 1311 invasive breast cancers with a significantly larger size, higher grade and higher incidence of the medullary carcinoma, frequent recurrence and infrequent node metastasis. Morphologically, basal-like breast cancers showed a significantly more solid architecture and ribbon-like architecture associated with necrosis (more geographic necrosis) and central scar, a more pushing margin, lymphocytic infiltration and a higher mitosis score, more syncytial growth, presence of basaloid cells, spindle cells and squamous metaplasia. The disease-free survival and overall survival of basal-like breast cancers were significantly poorer than that of luminal A subtype, but similar to the other ER-negative subtypes. Basal markers were not independent prognostic factors.
All the 5 patients were males. The mean age was 52.6 years. The median duration before diagnosis was 1 month. Clinically, 3 patients presented in stage IV and 2 in stage III. Four of them had generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Hepatomegaly and massive effusion were found in 1 and 2 cases, respectively. Marrow involvement was detected in 3 of the 4 patients with bone marrow biopsy performed and one of them also accompanied by lymphocytosis. Histologically, the involved lymph nodes showed partial or complete effacement of nodal architecture and replacement by a monomorphous population of small lymphoid cells. Scanty large lymphoid cells were also identified in 4 cases. Increase in number of blood vessels was noticed in two of them as well. Immunohistochemically, the lymphoma cells in all cases expressed two or more of the T-cell markers and CD43. The staining for CD20, TdT, CD56 and granzyme B was negative. CD99 expression was noted in 3 of the 4 cases. The Ki-67 index ranged from 5% to 15%. Clonal TCRgamma gene rearrangement was detected in the 4 cases studied and one of them also showed TCRbeta gene rearrangement. In-situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA was negative in the 4 cases studied. Follow up information was available in 3 of the 5 cases. All of the 3 patients died of the disease, with an average survival of 21.7 months.
The lymph nodes of the 12 cases studied showed effacement of the nodal architecture and was replaced by a monotonous infiltration of small lymphoid cells. Among them, proliferation centers were identified in 6 cases. Similar morphologic pattern was seen in the 40 bone marrow biopsy samples, but no proliferation center formation obtained. The infiltration pattern of tumor cells in the bone marrow were further subdivided into nodular (n = 9), interstitial (n = 3), mixed (n = 9) and diffuse types (n = 19). There was no significant difference found on survival rates between the diffuse infiltration and non-diffuse infiltration groups (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.199). ZAP-70 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm and nuclei of lymphoma cells. There were 21 cases (40.4%) positive for ZAP-70 and among them, 11 died of this disease or the related infections. On the other hand, ZAP-70 was negative in 31 cases (59.6%) and only 4 of them died of this disease or related infections. The overall survival in ZAP-70-negative group was higher than that of the ZAP-70-positive group (59 months versus 39 months, chi(2) = 6.991, P = 0.008). Follow-up information was available in 51 patients. Among the 21 dead cases, 15 died of CLL/SLL or the related infection.
The patient's ages ranged from 29 to 57 years old, all were males. Abnormal electrocardiograms were obtained in all of the 5 cases. Among them, 3 were diagnosed using echocardiography. Histopathologic examination showed that there were abnormally coarse muscle trabeculation and deep recesses, interlacing in arrangement, over the inner wall of the heart chambers. The compacted myocardium became thinning down gradually from the base to the apex of the heart. The non-compacted myocardium bundles locating close to the endocardium were coarse and orderless in arrangement, nuclei were irregular and abnormal, nevertheless, the arrangement and appearance of the muscle bundles near by the pericardium part were essentially normal and the cell nuclei were evenly distributed.
Overall, 33 of 45 (73.3%) ASC-H cases were biopsy proven cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN). 36 of 45 ASC-H cases were HPV-DNA positive, including 19 cases of HSIL and over lesion; whereas no HSIL or over was found in 9 HR-HPV negative cases. Sensitivity and negativity predictive value of HR-HPV in ASC-H with HSIL and over lesion were both 100%.

The average symptom score of SGRQ was 49 +/- 24, activity score 57 +/- 23, impact score 46 +/- 23 and total score 50 +/- 21, which were all higher than scores of the healthy populations. The average direct medical cost (including outpatient cost, inpatient cost, and medicine purchasing cost) was 11 744 RMB yuan annually. The direct non-medical cost (including transportation fee, nutrition fee, and nursing fee) was 1570 RMB yuan. 36% of the patients in work had an average of 17 working days lost in the last 12 months because of COPD, while 17% of their relatives had an average of 14 working days lost for caring the patients.
Totally 416 patients were enrolled, with 86 COPD patients and 330 lung cancer patients. Patients with COPD were older than those with lung cancer. The incidences of co-morbidities such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory failure and lung infection in AECOPD patients were higher than those in lung cancer patients. Second malignant neoplasm of important organs was found in 211 patients (63.94%) with lung cancer. In the last hospitalization, the total amount of direct medical costs was higher for patients with AECOPD than for patients with lung cancer [74 143 (102 608) RMB vs 37 810 (51 374) RMB], z = 2.48, P &lt; 0.05, especially for the treatment cost [(19 324 (61 843) vs 5876 (9764), z = 4.55, P &lt; 0.01] and the laboratory cost [7976 (18 397) vs 3397 (4096), z = 5.97, P &lt; 0.01]. There was no significant difference in the constituents of the cost between COPD and lung cancer patients (chi(2) = 8.23, P &gt; 0.05). The percentage of the drug cost to the total cost was the highest, followed by the treatment cost and the auxiliary examination cost. The ratio of the drug cost to the total cost was lower in COPD patients (37.2 +/- 12.6)% vs (53.8 +/- 17.6)%, t = 7.34, P &lt; 0.01, while the constituent ratio of treatment cost was higher in COPD than in lung cancer patients
In the recruited 83 cases, there were 50 males and 33 females, aged from 7 to 85 years old, with a mean age of 37.8 years. Cough, fever and chest pain were common symptoms, but no significant symptoms were seen in 25 patients (31.3%). Some patients had positive physical signs, such as dullness to percussion and low breath sound. Pulmonary tuberculosis was also present in 36 patients (43.3%) with pleural tuberculoma. A history of tuberculous pleurisy was elicited in 80 patients, among whom 45 (56.3%) received delayed antituberculous treatment and 42 (52.5%) received nonstandard treatment. Forty-eight cases (60.0%) did not receive corticosteroids. Fifty-nine cases underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, while 24 underwent thoracoscopic surgery, and tuberculosis was pathologically confirmed in 62 (74.7%). Pathological profiles included granuloma, coagulation or caseation necrosis, lymphocyte infiltration, epithelioid cells, inflammatory cells, histiocytes and scar tissue. Fifteen (18.1%) specimens from percutaneous biopsy were anti-fast smear positive, while Mycobacterium tuberculosis was obtained by culture in 21 (25.3%) cases. Chest X-ray showed that solitary lesions were seen in 68 cases, multiple foci in 15. The lesions of 46 cases (55.4%) occupied the lower right lobes. Round-like shadows were the most common signs, which were present in 63 cases (75.9%). CT examination demonstrated homogeneous density in 20, heterogeneous density in 40, calcification in 9, central attenuation in 34, and peripheral intensification in 28 cases.
Univariate analysis demonstrated that the "null" genotype of GST M1 gene occurred in 50 (47.2%) of the cases, more frequent than in the controls [25 (23.6%)], with a crude OR (95%CI) 2.786 (1.513 - 5.130). No significant association was observed between ADIH and GST T1 polymorphism. Among the risk factors analyzed, body mass index and alcohol drinking were significantly associated with ADIH. In the multivariate analysis, a significant association between ADIH and the "null" genotype of GST M1 existed, after adjusting for body mass index and drinking status, adjusted OR (95%CI) being 3.022 (1.540 - 5.926). Again, no significant association was observed between GST T1 polymorphism and ADIH.
Eighty-seven percent of the physicians believed asthma was an airway inflammatory disease. Sixty-nine percent chose inhaled glucocorticoids as daily first-line drug for persistent asthma and 55% had read asthma guidelines. However, only 24% had ever heard China Asthma Alliance (CAA) and only 6% had visited its website. Moreover, no one under investigation had participated in the CAA organized talks popularizing the standardization of asthma treatment. Over the past year, 55% of the respondents did not participate in any asthma-related meetings or seminars. Ninety-six percent of those surveyed expressed the hope that higher-level hospital doctors would come to the community hospital for asthma-related seminars. Among the 45 community health service centers, only 2 collected part of the registration data for asthma patients and only one conducted health education seminars for asthma patients during the past year.
Bronchi leading to pleura fistulae were located by TBD in 34 out of the 40 cases. Air leakage was stopped after the first occlusion in 30 cases, but 5 of which underwent a second occlusion because of recurrence in 72 h. Of the 5 cases, air leakage was stopped in 3, and surgery was required in 2. Taken together, 28 of the 34 cases were cured by SBO and 6 failed. There were no statistically differences between the treatment group and the control group in oxygenation changes during TBD and SBO procedures. In 10 cases thorax CT scan was followed up in 7 days after SBO, and no obstructive atelectasis was found. In 20 cases peripheral white blood cell count was followed up 72 hours after SBO. Leukocytosis (&gt; 10.0 x 10(9)/L) was found in 3, in which pulmonary infection was diagnosed, and leukocytosis was present in 2 cases before the procedure. Five patients (5/34) experienced mild to moderate fever, which resolved quickly.

Primary RPMCs were isolated successfully. Overexpression of ET-1 resulted in a significant increase in total protein synthesis, expression of alpha-SMA, as well as increased cell size. Western blotting results showed that overexpression of ET-1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and a decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in RPMC.
In comparison with controls [(325.70 +/- 117.54) ng/L], the level of serum VEGF [(764.33 +/- 263.64) ng/L] was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) and the DC numbers was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01) in patients with OSCC. There was a negative correlation between serum VEGF concentration and the level of DC (P &lt; 0.01). The expression of VEGF in primary focus was positively correlated with serum VEGF concentration, but was negatively correlated with the level of peripheral blood DC (P &lt; 0.01). DC cultured in vitro with VEGF(165) decreased the expression of CD-1a, CD-40, CD-80, CD-86, CD-83, HLA-DR, and revealed a lower ability of stimulating T lymphocyte proliferation but a higher ability of uptake, compared to controls.
Low dose of celecoxib (10 micromol/L, &lt; IC(50)) combined with bleomycin showed synergism or additive lethal effect on Tca8113 cell line.

The total cholesterol levels were also significantly different among the four groups (P = 0.017).
Stress distributions under 5 loading conditions were obtained. Stress concentrations were generally found near the loading areas at the veneer and at the lower surface of the core beneath the loading areas. In the 5 loading conditions, it was found that when the crown was loaded with vertical concentrated load, the tensile stresses around the shoulder areas were uniform, while stress concentration with maximum of 32.25 MPa was found at the shoulder areas in lingual-buccal direction when loads were applied at an angle of 10 degrees with the tooth axis on the buccal side. The masticatory load which was applied at 20 degrees with the tooth axis on the buccal side would cause stress concentration at the shoulder in mesial-distal direction. The maximum value could reach 11.29 MPa.
In Group A, the majority of dentin tubules were blocked by sclerotic rods. In Group B, the honeycomb-like change was found on the sclerotic dentin surface. The surface structure of Group C was similar to that of Group B. In group D etching wiped off the honeycomb-like structure.

The susceptibility rates of staphylococci to daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftobiprole, vancomycin and teicoplanin were 100%. All staphylococcus strains were inhibited by daptomycin at a MIC of 1 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 0.5 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MRSCoN). Among Enterococcus spp, the highest MIC of daptomycin was 4 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 2 mg/L against E.faecalis, whereas they were 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L against E.faecium. One strains of linezolid-resistant E.faecalis (MIC: 8 mg/L) was susceptible to daptomycin (MIC: 1 mg/L). Three strains of E.faecium carrying vanA gene with vancomycin MICs above 32 mg/L and teicoplanin MICs also 32 mg/L were susceptible to daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid.

94 patients were included, 4 patients were proven, 29 patients were probable, 34 patients were possible IFI, 27 patients were non-IPA. The positive rate of the GM was 31.9% (30/94). The sensitivity and specificity of GM in proven cases and probable cases are 66.7% and 92.6%. GM assay tended to become positive earlier than the culture 2 - 10 (5.33 +/- 2.17) d. We found that differences in patient diagnosis and selection might account for the disparities seen for positive rate for the GM test. There was positive in three of the four patients with proven, the positive rate of GM was 65.5% for probable cases, for possible cases was 17.6%, for non-IPA cases was 7.4% (P = 0.001). For patient with neutropenia, treated with immunosuppressive agents and without immunosuppressive agents, the positive rate of GM was 52.9% vs 41.7% vs 34.6% (P = 0.015); the sensitivity was 80.0% vs 70.0% vs 53.8% (P = 0.011), the ODI was 1.365 (0.582 - 6.736) vs 1.123 (0.623 - 6.868) vs 0.554 (0.522 - 0.823), P = 0.005, respectively.
Small vessel proliferation and the uneven thickness of the wall were found in the 3 MELAS patients. A lot of brown deposits was shown in the wall of small vessels and also noted in neurons.
Different 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps were obtained for the protein spots in the late-onset Alzheimer disease group and the control group gels.11 protein spots showed a significantly differential expression between the two groups of cerebral cortex samples. It was found that the expression of DJ-1 protein was increased in the late-onset Alzheimer disease group in comparison with the control group after searching in the database.
Altogether 102 cases were enrolled and 99 cases were followed up for 12 weeks. According to the Chinese Consensus, the rate of high risk, very high risk-I and very high risk-II was 44%, 28% and 28%, respectively. Targeting rate for LDL-C lowering was 77% - 85% at each time point in the SDTG and IDTG groups, being significantly higher than those in the SDNTG group (12% - 16%, P &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was found concerning the occurrence of recurrent stroke, other vascular events and safety endpoints among the three groups. The amplitude of LDL-C lowering was 32% - 35%, 46% - 49%, 51% - 52% and 60% - 65% with corresponding to daily dosage of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg atorvastatin.
Significant correlation was found between the number of CAGs with age of onset (r = -0.671, P &lt; 0.01). There was also correlation between the Appel score and the course of disease (r = 0.855, P &lt; 0.01), but no correlation between the Appel score and the number of CAGs (r = 0.100, P = 0.601).
CACS was significantly associated with age, history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. It was also associated with the presence of mitral annular calcification and aortic valve calcification, low ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) and high mean artery pressure (MAP) as well as high values of brachial ankle PWV (baPWV) and Upstroke time (UT). Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of aortic valve calcification and mitral annular calcification, the history of diabetes mellitus and high value of UT were independently correlated with severe coronary artery calcification.
The total duration of symptoms in patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease was longer than that in patients with intestinal tuberculosis (P &lt; 0.05). The incidence of colectomy is significantly higher in Crohn's disease than in intestinal tuberculosis because of intestinal obstruction or undefined diagnosis (P &lt; 0.05). Hematochezia, extra-intestinal manifestation and ileus occurred significantly more in Crohn's disease than in intestinal tuberculosis (P &lt; 0.05). Night sweating and hypoalbuminemia occurred significantly more in intestinal tuberculosis than in Crohn's disease (P &lt; 0.05). The positive rate of serum antibodies to mycobacterium and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate is higher in intestinal tuberculosis than in Crohn's disease (P &lt; 0.05). Cobblestone sign and fissure-shape ulcers were only found in Crohn's disease, while circular ulcer occurred significantly more in intestinal tuberculosis (P &lt; 0.05). The involvement of stomach, jejunum or ileum was significantly more in Crohn's disease than in intestinal tuberculosis (P &lt; 0.05).Granulomas were more common in intestinal tuberculosis than in Crohn's disease (P &lt; 0.05) and the site of granulomas was valuable for differential diagnosis. In all the Crohn's disease specimens, lymphoid aggregates in the lamina propria or submucosa were significantly more in surgically resected specimens than in endoscopic biopsies (P &lt; 0.05).
Immunohistochemical analysis of intestinal pathological specimens demonstrated higher expression of VEGF. ELISA showed that the expression of VEGF under hypoxia was obviously higher than that under normoxia [(1199.3 +/- 61.4) ng/L vs (864.7 +/- 41.2) ng/L, P &lt; 0.05]. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot discovered that thalidomide inhibited the expression of VEGF/HIF-1alpha of HUVEC (P &lt; 0.05). The effect of thalidomide was dose-dependent.
A total of twenty-five subjects with moderate and severe asthma were enrolled. By combined therapy for one month the asthma symptoms relieved and FEV(1)%pred improved significantly (P &lt; 0.01). The concentrations of H(2)O(2), NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) and LTE(4) in induced sputum and EBC declined significantly (P &lt; 0.01) although the concentrations were still higher than those at normal baseline. More marked reduction of H(2)O(2) and NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) compared to LTE(4) was observed. It was revealed that the concentrations of H(2)O(2)and NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) but not of LTE(4) in EBC were negatively correlated with FEV(1)%pred (P &lt; 0.01) and positively with symptom scores. Such correlations were also found in H(2)O(2) in induced sputum with FEV(1)%pred and symptom scores as well as NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) in induced sputum with FEV(1)%pred. The improvement of FEV(1)%pred after treatment was positively correlated with the reduction of H(2)O(2) and NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) both in induced sputum and EBC. Correlation analysis also demonstrated three inflammatory indices were equivalent in induced sputum and EBC (correlation coefficient of H(2)O(2), NO(3)(-)/NO(2)(-) and LTE(4), 0.759, 0.826 and 0.653, respectively. P &lt; 0.01).
Monotherapy with nateglinide (120 mg, 3/d) or acarbose (100 mg, 3/d) decreased HbA1c to a similar extent during 12-week treatment. The mean change from baseline to end-point in HbA1c was (-0.90 +/- 0.98)% and (-0.83 +/- 0.81)% in patients receiving nateglinide and acarbose, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was similar between nateglinide and acarbose (P &gt; 0.05). The mean change in 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PG2h) was (-1.45 +/- 2.74) mmol/L and (-2.20 +/- 2.21) mmol/L in patients receiving nateglinide and acarbose (P = 0.0017). Body weight was significantly decreased in both groups at the end-point (P &lt; 0.05), although the decrease was more with acarbose than nateglinide [(-0.66 +/- 1.79) kg vs (-2.06 +/- 2.00) kg, P = 0.0000]. And the proportion of patients experiencing any presumed drug related adverse events was not significantly different between the two groups.
Iodine status in the 3 communities were stable. Decreased TSH level (&lt; 0.3 mU/L) developed in 2.5% (n = 68) of sampled subjects, while raised TSH level (&gt; 4.8 mU/L) in 2.4% (n = 64). A logistic analysis showed that risk factors for developing decreased TSH level included positive conversion of TPOAb (OR = 5.5), positive TPOAb both in 1999 and in 2004 (OR = 4.0), positive TgAb in 2004 (OR = 3.7) and TSH &lt; 1.0 mU/L in 1999 (OR = 2.6). Risk factors involved in developing raised TSH level included iodine status of Zhangwu community (OR = 4.1), iodine status of Huanghua community (OR = 3.9), positive TgAb in 2004 (OR = 3.7), positive TPOAb both in 1999 and 2004 (OR = 3.6), positive conversion of TPOAb (OR = 2.7) and TSH &gt; 1.9 mU/L in 1999 (OR = 2.6).
The median percentage of NK cell activity was significantly lower in the first group (18.3 +/- 5.6)% and the second (16.7 +/- 6.7)% than that in the third group (33.4 +/- 6.8)% or in the controls (36.6 +/- 5.0)%. The median percentage of glycosylated ferritin was also significantly lower in the first group (15.4 +/- 2.0)% and the second group (16.9 +/- 3.4)% than that in the third group (40.4 +/- 3.0)% or in the controls (45.2 +/- 2.2)%. Meanwhile, the median level of sCD(25) was significantly higher in the first group (12 916 +/- 4328) ng/L and the second group (12 117 +/- 5465) ng/L than that in the third group (4728 +/- 1482) ng/L or in the controls (3841 +/- 993) ng/L. Furthermore, NK cell activity, sCD(25) and glycosylated ferritin were abnormal in all the patients in the early stage of HLH.
(1) Patients were divided into two subgroups by a cutoff of 5% residual bone marrow blasts at T1 or T2 time point. Patients with percentage of residual bone marrow blast cells &lt; 5% had better complete remission (CR) rate, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than the patients with percentage &gt; or = 5% at T1 or T2. The percentage of residual bone marrow blast cells at T1 was correlated with that at T2. (2) The prognosis of patients with intermediate karyotypes with percentage &lt; 5% at T1 or T2 was similar to that of the patients with favorable karyotypes. The patients with intermediate karyotypes and percentage of residual bone marrow blasts &gt; or = 5% at T1 or T2 are defined as a subgroup with prognosis similar to that of patients with unfavorable karyotypes. (3) COX regression analysis showed that the percentage of residual bone marrow blasts at T1 or T2 is an independent prognostic factor of AML. The percentage of residual bone marrow blasts at T1 may be more helpful in prognostication than that at T2.
The central retina was nonperfused region at P12. The most of the central retina showed almost no perfusion and the radial vessels appeared tortuous and dilated at P14. Retinal neovascularization occurred at maximum between postnatal day 17 and postnatal day 19. Paraffin tissue slice with hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that in the control group the average counts of vascular endothelial cells which break through the inner limiting membrane were hardly seen, but in hyperoxia group were noticeably more than in the control group. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results: the mRNA of mTERT and bFGF in the retinopathy group were higher than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Real-time PCR results: the expression of mTERT mRNA in the retinopathy group was noticeably higher than in the control group (F = 173.104, P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that mTERT protein were positive in the retinal neovascularization of the hyperoxia group, but were negative in the retinal vessel of the control group.
The mean VEGF level of vitreous was (592.4801 +/- 587.4267) ng/L in PDR patients, and it was (131.3022 +/- 26.9192) ng/L in normal control. VEGF level was significantly higher in PDR patients than that in normal control (t = 3.2315, P &lt; 0.05). There were 10 eyes (20%) with progression of PDR, 10 eyes (20%) with stabilization, and 30 eyes (60%) with regression. Vitreous level of VEGF was significantly higher in eyes with progression of PDR than that in eyes with stabilization or regression of PDR (q = -3.3187, -4.0843; P &lt; 0.05). Vitreous level of VEGF was significantly higher in eyes without retinal photocoagulation than that in eyes underwent panretinal photocoagulation or local photocoagulation (q = -4.2187, -3.9672; P &lt; 0.05).
RPE cells were significantly inhibited by curcumin in a dose dependent and time dependent manner. The IC(50) value of curcumin at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h was 29.31 mg/L, 17.50 mg/L, 13.24 mg/L and 10.99 mg/L respectively. Ca(2+) was significantly increased at 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after cultured with curcumin (15 mg/L) than that of the control group respectively (t = 7.50, 10.61, 20.74, 21.14, P &lt; 0.01), and DeltaPsim was significantly decreased at 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after cultured with curcumin (15 mg/L) than that of the control group respectively (t = 7.50, 11.74, 14.91, 15.29, P &lt; 0.01). There was no change of DNA content in RPE cells at 8h after cultured with curcumin (15 mg/L), but significantly lower than that of the control group at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h respectively (t = 10.00, 14.68, 13.68, P &lt; 0.01).
All the intraocular foreign bodies were removed successfully without any damage to the retina due to the viscosity of silicon oil and its gasket function.
Oculomotor nerves (CN3) and abducens (CN6) of the cisternal segment were well demonstrable in all normal subjects. Trochlear nerves (CN4) were depicted 95%. CN3 could be demonstrated consistently in the cavernous sinus, because of their small diameter, CN4 and CN6 not always detectable. The larger inferior division of CN3 and branches to the target EOMs and CN6 were demonstrated well in all species. The superior division of CN3 was demonstrated 60%, CN4 was showed 40%.
Among eight TASS cases, seven were post cataract surgery cases and one was post cornea penetrating injury. Three cases were caused by residual povidone iodine on instruments, 2 cases resulted from the misuse of distilled water as intraocular irrigating liquid during cataract surgery, 2 cases were produced by the countercurrent of antibiotic solution via the cornea-scleral incision into anterior chamber during subconjunctival injection at the end of the surgery, and 1 case was induced by the injection of the distilled water into the anterior chamber at the end of the surgery. Three TASS cases occurred during operation and 5 cases occurred at 1 day after operation. All eight cases suffered from the painless blurred vision. Three cases occurred during operation presented with decrease of corneal transparency and depigmentation of iris. On the first day after operation, all cases had diffuse corneal stroma edema and severe anterior uveitis. Dexamethasone 0.1% or prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops, three times per day or one time per hour was used in all cases. Carteolol 2% eye drop, two times per day, was used for the cases with ocular hypertension. The cornea was clear in 6 cases, but corneal endothelial decompensation in 2 cases after therapy.
Fourteen cases were male and 35 cases were female. Both eyes were affected in 17 cases (34.7%). Age ranged from 23 - 74 years old with an average of 47 years. The visual acuity was 0.05 or less in 13 eyes; 0.06 - 0.2 in 22 eyes and 0.3 or more in 31 eyes. Primary tumours were found in 40 cases (81.6%) (surgical excision in 25 cases), consisting of breast carcinoma in 16 cases (32.7%), lung carcinoma in 14 cases (28.6%), hepatoma and cholangiocarcinoma in 3 cases, colon and stomach carcinomas in 3 cases, gynecologic appendix carcinoma (including 1 case of ovarian mucous cyst adenocarcinoma) in 2 cases, nasopharyngeal adenocarcinoma in 1 case, vertebra tumor in 1 case, undetected in 5 cases (10.2%) and under detection in 4 cases (8.2%). The fundus had 1 lesion in 58 eyes (58/66 = 87.8%), 2 lesions in 4 eyes (4/66 = 6.0%), 3 or more lesions in 2 eyes (including 7 lesions in 1 eye). According to the location and development status of the lesions, they could be divided into solitary type, 39 eyes (39/66 = 59.1%); diffuse type, 19 eyes (19/66 = 28.8%); and early type, 8 eyes (8/66 = 12.1%). FFA examination: early stage lesions showed hypofluorescence and later stage lesions showed moderate to strong hyperfluorescence. In 8 cases of solitary lesions, the size of the lesion measured by B-scan averaged 11.5 mm x 10.5 mm x 3.6 mm with the maximal height at 4.9 mm. The tumor became flattened and vision remained stable at 3 months after plaque radiotherapy in 1 case. Three cases were followed-up for 2, 3, and 4 months after TTT treatment. The lesions remained stable with vision unchanged or slightly decreased.
Suggestive evidence of linkage was detected at marker D2S325 (LOD score [Z] = 2.29, recombination fraction [theta] = 0.00). Precise targeting and haplotype analysis traced the disease gene to a 19.04 cM region bounded by D2S117 and D2S2382 on chromosome 2q32.3-q35. Direct sequencing of the candidate gene cluster revealed a G--&gt;A transversion in exon 3 of CRYGC.
The AcrySof IQ group has significantly higher and middle spatial frequency of contrast sensitivity. The difference in low spatial frequency was getting significant along with time. Patients with AcrySof IQ had a reduction in total high-order aberrations and spherical aberration. There were no difference in coma between two groups.
There was a more significant decrease of the hemodynamic parameters in both PSVs and EDVs of temporal PCAs (PSV: t = 3.044, P = 0.005; EDV: t = 3.731, P = 0.001) and temporal SPCAs (PSV: t = 2.822, P = 0.008; EDV: t = 3.194, P = 0.003) compared the patients group's affected eyes with normal health adults group eyes, there was a more significant decrease of them of temporal PCAs (PSV: t = 3.219, P = 0.003; EDV: t = 3.807, P = 0.001) and temporal SPCAs (PSV: t = 3.931, P = 0.000, EDV: t = 3.145, P = 0.003) compared the patients group's contralateral eyes with normal health adults group eyes, and there was a statistical significance of them (P &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in hemodynamic parameters of both PSVs and EDVs of temporal PCAs (PSV: t = 0.608, P = 0.548; EDV: t = 0.122, P = 0.904) and temporal SPCAs (PSV: t = 0.730, P = 0.470; EDV: t = 0.109, P = 0.914) between affected eyes and contralateral eyes of the patients, and there was no statistical significance of them (P &gt; 0.05). The results of FFA and ICGA showed that all the RPE's leaks of 57 affected eyes appeared at the hypofluorescent regions of relative choroids; 52 cases of 57 affected eyes were followed by choroidal vessels dilatation at the early hypofluorescent regions, and appeared hyperfluorescence leakages in the late phase images; At the all regions of RPE's transmitted fluorescences of affected eyes and contralateral eyes, the corresponding choroids showed hyperfluorescence in the late phase images in ICGA; There were no RPE's transmitted fluorescences at the regions of 20 affected eyes and 16 contralateral eyes in FFA, which showed hyperfluoresceince leakages in the late phase images of choroids in ICGA.
The major pathway for HNE metabolism in normal lens was conjugation with glutathione (GSH) to form GS-HNE (45%), followed by HNE's oxidation to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid (HNA) by ALDH, which accounted for approximately 9.1% of HNE. The conjugation of HNE with GSH in diabetic lens was decreased approximately 64% at day 30 compared with the controls (F = 49.59, P &lt; 0.001). The pathway of HNE oxidation by ALDH in the diabetic lens was enhanced approximately 1.7 times at day 70 compared to day 30 (F = 11.51, P = 0.0442). A higher ALDH activity, greater amount of ALDH protein, and less amount of HNE-protein adduct were presented in diabetic rat lens.
Restrictive enzyme digestion and sequence analysis showed that four recombinant plamids were constructed successfully and the aim sequence was obtained. The expression of p27Kip1 mRNA and p27Kip1 protein of Pgenesil-P1 group, Pgenesil-P2 group and Pgenesil-P3 group were all lower than that in the control group, including blank group and negative siRNA group. The inhibitive rate of mRNA reached 32.71%, 67.76% and 80.28% (F = 453.102, P = 0.000 in each group) and the inhibitive rate of protein reached 29.27%, 64.73% and 76.13% (F = 75.385, P = 0.000 in each group) compared with the blank group. As the lowest expression among the three positive shRNA group, Pgenesil-P3 was selected for the next steps. There was no significant difference between blank group and negative Pgenesil-HK of the expression of p27Kip1 protein (P = 0.356) and the express of p27Kip1 mRNA (P = 0.246). Compared with the control group and the blank group, the growth of the bCEC transfected by Pgenesil-P3 was significantly promoted with increased cell percent of S-phrase (F = 334.957, P = 0.000) and decreased cell percent of G1-phrase (F = 134.224, P = 0.000).
After 12 weeks, compared with control eyes, the IOP of rat OHT eyes was significantly (F = 1519.67, P &lt; 0.01) elevated. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was increased in cell nucleus and cytoplasm in sclera lamina cribrosa in rat OHT when compared to control eyes with negative expression. No expressions of TIMP-1, TIMP-2 in sclera lamina cribrosa were found in both OHT and control eyes. The mean gray-scale values of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in OHT were significantly (F = 405.55, F = 436.11, F = 1167.77, and F = 4629.64, P &lt; 0.01) higher than control eye by Western blotting (193.88 +/- 8.84 vs 117.38 +/- 10.76, 202.65 +/- 8.37 vs 134.13 +/- 5.06, 283.63 +/- 5.65 vs 186.88 +/- 7.14, and 284.75 +/- 5.50 vs 183.0 +/- 5.58), while by RT-PCR (200.50 +/- 3.25 vs 181.88 +/- 9.36, 200.13 +/- 2.95 vs 181.75 +/- 5.85, 201.88 +/- 3.14 vs 179.25 +/- 9.21, and 195.50 +/- 3.55 vs 179.75 +/- 7.12), respectively.
Ten cases aged 31-58 years (mean 43 years) were included in this study. Among them, 9 cases were male, 1 case was female. All cases were unilateral involved, 5 cases were right eye, 5 cases were left eye. The distribution of the visual acuity was follows: light perception in 2 eyes, 20/200 in one eye, 20/20 or above in 7 eyes. The tumor mass at the optic disc with extensive serous detachment of retina was detected on B-scan in one eye. The benign melanocytoma was diagnosed by vitreous fine needle biopsy for this eye. In other case, the tumor was found to be enlarged, visual field defect deteriorated, pigment granules appeared in the vitreous adjacent to the tumor during on year follow-up period. On the patient request, enucleation was performed to rule out the malignancy of the tumor. Pathologic study showed that the tumor cells were active, but benign state. The tumor size and visual acuity in other eight eyes remained stable in the follow-up period with one to 18 years (mean 3.5 years). On FFA and ICGA, bilateral choroidal nevi were found in one eye.
Nine eyes of 5 patients with CM were examined. Unilateral choroidal involvement was present in 1 patient, bilateral in 4 cases. There were 1 case male and 4 case females. The age of these patients ranged from 31 to 56 years, median 45 years. Ocular symptoms included reduced vision in 4 patients and visual distortion in 1 patient. Visual acuity was 20/400- &lt; 20/63 in four eyes; 20/63- &lt; 20/30 in two eyes and &gt;or= 20/30 in three eyes. The primary cancer site was in the lung in 3 patients, in the breast in 1 patient and in the stomach in 1 patient. Fundus characteristics: Typical CM was more often in the plateau-shaped than in the dome-shaped; yellow-white or mottled in color and associated with subretinal fluid and retinal detachment. The tumor was found in the macular area and juxtapapillary area in 6 eyes, in the area between the macula and the equator in 3 eyes. CM was solitary in 5 eyes and showed multiple lesions in 4 eyes. By FA the lesions showed mottled hyperfluorescence in early stage and leakage in late stage. By ICGA the lesion showed blocked fluorescence and hypofluorescence. Choroidal mass showed moderate irregular internal reflectivity in A-scan ultrasound. B-scan showed a plateau-shaped solid mass. MRI examination of the lesion revealed moderate short T1W and T2W signals. The cancer antigen increased to 16.28 and 4.95 microg/L in two cases. CA125 increased to 160.5 kU/L in one case.
The 2- and 5-year local recurrence rate of solid type orbital adenoid cystic carcinoma was significantly higher than that of the adeno-tubiform type [2-year, 85% (17/20) vs 23.53% (8/34), chi(2) = 19.14, P = 0.000; 5-year, 100% (19/19) vs 64.52% (20/31), Fisher's exact test, P = 0.003]. The regional extension and distant metastasis of solid type were more than those of adeno-tubiform type. The 5-year local recurrence rate treated by postoperative radiation was lower than that treated with only surgical excision [70% (14/20) vs 92.86% (13/14); Fisher's exact test, P = 0.198]. The 5-year local recurrence rate in patients initially treated by orbital evisceration during the first time was lower than that of cases which evisceration procedure was used after the recurrence [25% (1/4) vs 75% (6/8), Fisher's exact test, P = 0.222]. Tumors may extend into intracalvarium, nasal cavity and temporal fossa. They may spread to the lung, bone, liver and lymph node. The 5-year metastasis rate was 25.71% (9/35). Both of the lung and bone metastasis rates were 33.33% (3/9). The overall 5-year accumulative survival was 74.29% (26/35), mortality was 25.71% (9/35), and rate of survival without tumor recurrence was 37.14% (13/35). The 10-year disease free survival rate was 17.14% (6/35). Patients were most likely to die with intracranial extension. Surgical excision with postoperative radiation improved the 5-year survival rate to 80% (16/20).
The positive expression rates of P-gp, LRP and MRP were 64.0%, 25.3%, 36.0% in Rb, respectively. The co-expression rates of P-gp and LRP, P-gp and MRP, LRP and MRP were 18.7%, 32.0%, 20.0%, respectively. All tested proteins showed significant correlation to the differentiation of the tumor (P = 0.006, 0.000, 0.000, respectively), but no correlation was found between the expression of these markers and the age or sex of the patients. Significant positive correlations were observed between P-gp and MRP expression (P = 0.001), and between LRP and MRP expression (P = 0.000).
In HE staining slides, VM was present in Rb specimens and was formed by tumor cells but not endothelial cells. Red blood cells were present in the VM. VM existed in 18.33% (11/60) of the Rb specimens. Low R-E graded Rb specimens exhibited a higher VM positive rate than that in the high R-E graded Rb (chi(2) = 8.861, P &lt; 0.05). The positive rate of VM was 4.34% in differentiated type of Rb and was 22.02% in undifferentiated type of Rb (chi(2) = 4.872, P &lt; 0.05). HIF-1alpha and VEGF expressions in Rb with VM were significantly greater than those in Rb without VM (P = 0.001). The density of endothelial vessels correlated with VM. The mean MVD was 49.77 +/- 2.05 in Rb without VM and 36.53 +/- 1.15 in Rb with VM (P &lt; 0.05).
In 152 children, a complete examination was performed in 119 children had visual acuity of &gt;or= 0.6; 12 children had visual acuity of &lt; 0.6; 21 children could not complete the examination. The mean age of these 21 children was significantly lower than the others. Using Titmus 60'', Titmus 100'' and RPS 60'' as the normal criteria, the normal ratio of near stereopsis acuity in the 119 children was correlated to the age by chi(2) test. They were divided into four groups by 5 month-age groups. The normal ratio in the 46 to 50 month group was significantly greater than that in the other three groups. The normal ratios was 89.9%, 94.1% and 95.0% for the criteria of Titmus 100'', RPS 200'' and TNO 240'', respectively.
During the follow-up time, the patients in the test group had better uncorrected near vision acuity (UCNV) and distance corrected near vision acuity (DCNVA)(P = 0.000). The test group had the same corrected vision acuity as the control group. Six months after surgery, push-up test showed that the mean accommodative amplitude was (1.60 +/- 0.57) D in the test group and (1.10 +/- 0.70) D in the control group. The change of the ACD was (0.50 +/- 0.37) mm in the test group and (0.08 +/- 0.06) mm in the control group. Twelve months after surgery, push-up test showed that the mean accommodative amplitude was (1.38 +/- 0.52) D in the test group and (1.06 +/- 0.61) D in the control group. The change of the ACD was (0.30 +/- 0.27) mm in the test group and (0.10 +/- 0.09) mm in the control group.
Repeatability errors of these three wavefront analyzer were found to be low. Comparisons on the same eye showed that there was a significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) in sphere and cylinder between ray-tracing aberrometer and the others in high SEQ group (&gt;or= -6.00 diopter). For HOA, all aberrometers obtained similar results in low SEQ group (&lt; -6.00 diopter). In the high SEQ group, the ray-tracing aberrometer showed statistically higher data in HOA and coma (P &lt; 0.01), and there was no significant difference between the skiascopy and the Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. The iTrace-OPD and iTrace-WASCA HOA difference correlated with spherical equivalent in the high SEQ group (r = -0.418, -0.399, P &lt; 0.01).
40 eyes (37 cases) of APACG and 56 eyes (45 cases) of CPACG were enrolled in this study. The median follow-up period was 24 and 25 months, respectively. IOP was significantly decreased from (53.6 +/- 17.9) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa, preoperation) to (10.5 +/- 4.9) mm Hg (postoperation) at time of discharging from hospital and (14.0 +/- 10.3) mm Hg at time of final follow up in APACG (F = 100.783, P &lt; 0.01), respectively, and from (36.8 +/- 13.8) mm Hg to (11.7 +/- 4.2) mm Hg at time of discharging from hospital and (13.8 +/- 4.5) mm Hg at time of final follow up in CPACG (F = 54.383, P &lt; 0.01), respectively. The IOP remained controlled (&lt; or = 21 mm Hg) without antiglaucomatous medication in 38 eyes (95.0%) of APACG and in 50 eyes (89.3%) of CPACG. Visual acuity was significantly (H = 12.316, P &lt; 0.01) decreased after trabeculectomy in all sub-types of PACG by Kruskal-wallis analysis. Shallow anterior chamber was commonly occurred after trabeculectomy.
Superficial epithelial cells of bulbar conjunctiva were characterized as large loose-arranged cells with a hyporeflective nucleus. The mean density is (1643 +/- 206) cells/mm(2). Intermediate epithelial cells were captured with features of oval small tight-arranged cells with a punctiform hyperreflective nucleus. The mean density is (4693 +/- 228) cells/mm(2). Basal epithelial cells appeared to be polygonal and regular-arranged within hyperreflective cell borders. The mean density is (4420 +/- 230) cells/mm(2). There was a significant difference among three kinds of conjunctival epithelium (F = 1160.312, P = 0.000). The presumed goblet cell was defined as a large hyperreflective oval-shaped cell with relatively homogeneous brightness, crowded in groups or mainly dispersed. The mean density is (432 +/- 72) cells/mm(2). The dendritic cell appeared to be hyperreflective corpuscular particles with dendritic processes scattered among conjunctival epithelial cells. The mean density is (22 +/- 25) cells/mm(2). The basement membrane, a prominent hyperreflective band, separated epithelial cells from subepithelial structure. Bulbar conjunctival substantia propria, beneath the basement membrane, was mainly composed of highly vascularized, loose connective tissues which were irregularly arranged fibers or a network of fibers, punctiform hyperreflective immune cells and sharp flows of blood vessels.
The average transplant survival time in the corneal allograft controls was (18.88 +/- 4.19) d. Treatment with J2 resulted in a significant increase of grafts' survival time (33.62 +/- 6.80) d (q = 0.85, P &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference between J2 and CsA groups. Histological examination showed that numerous lymphocytes infiltrated into the grafts 21 days after the operation in the control groups. Mild lymphocytes infiltration was found in both CsA and J2 groups. Immunohistochemical studies showed that large amount of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes infiltrated into the grafts of the placebo group at 21 days. J2 and CsA groups only showed a small number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes in the grafts. RT-PCR showed that few IL-2 and IL-10 genes were expressed in the autologous transplantation group in the first week, and the expression of these two cytokines showed no significant increase during following three weeks. Both genes were expressed from the first week in the allogeneic transplantation group and significantly increased in the third week. Both genes were expressed from the first week in CsA and J2 group, expression was reduced in the second and third weeks. Expression of these cytokines in the fourth week was stronger than those in previous three weeks.
Although the IOP of experimental groups are still the similar level at 2w after coagulation (t = 1.124, P = 0.287), Compared to control eyes, IOP in lasered eyes was significantly (t = 2.487, P = 0.036) increased at 1 month, lasting for 3 months and returned to normal from 5 to 6 months (t = 1.103, P = 0.290). The expression of CD11b in the retinal microglia in the lasered eyes was significantly more intensive than that in control eyes at 1 month (t = 3.333, P = 0.008) and faded after 5 months, a similar pattern to IOP response, that two group data shows significant dependability (r = 0.891, P = 0.014). The number of RGC was significantly reduced from 1 month to 6 months (t = 3.316, P = 0.009), the velocity of reducing seems dependability to the advancing of IOP (r = 0.757, P = 0.021).
The average value of IF and cited frequency of 13 kinds of ophthalmological periodicals were 0.3940 and 657 respectively in 2001 to 2006, which were higher than that of D part of CAJCCR. The periodicals which the five indexes of IF, non-self-citing impact factor, total cited frequency, the non-self-citing rate, immediacy index, rate of fund papers, web immediacy download rate, average value of h index and h(2)/n, high cited articles were Top 5 and cited by five or more than five kinds of the cole databases at home and abroad were Chinese Journal of Ophthalmology, Chinese Journal of Ocular Fundus Diseases, Practical Chinese Journal of Ophthalmology and Chinese Journal of Optometry &amp; Ophthalmology. Most of indexes of Chinese Journal of Ophthalmology were the first.
Fifty eight eyes of 57 patients underwent vitrectomy with gas (10% C(3)F(8)) injection. Primary closure was achieved in 44 eyes (75.9%) with an average hole size of 0.20 mm(2) (0.01 - 0.85 mm(2)), whereas the size in the remaining 14 eyes was 0.69 mm(2) (0.08 - 3.16 mm(2)). The closure rate of the 36 eyes treated with ILM peeling was 80.6% (29/36), and decreased visual acuity was not observed in 72.2% of them (26/36). The closure rate of the 22 eyes without ILM peeling was 68.2% (15/22), and decreased visual acuity was not observed in 59.1% of them (13/22). There was a significant difference in the size and the change of BCVA between the closed cases and the unclosed cases, and no other factors had significant effect on the BCVA.
After a six-month to three-year follow-up period, the reattachment rate was 69.2% (36/52 cases). Further vitrectomy surgeries were needed for other 16 eyes. The visual acuity was improved in 32 eyes (61.5%), three eyes (23.1%) with no change, and 8 eyes (15.4%) decreased. Macular epiretinal membrane happened postoperatively in one eye, and cataract was found in another case. There is no serious complications.
The five patients were all male, ranging in age from 6 to 18 years (mean 12 years). The lesion was unilateral; there were not any associated diseases. Presenting symptoms included painless decrease in vision, metamorphopsia, and discovery of strabismus. Initial visual acuity ranged from 20/333 to 20/50. Locations of the lesion included on optic disk and adjacent retina, and in the macular area. Clinical characteristics were slight elevation on optic disk or in retina, different degree of hyperpigmentation, retinal vascular tortuosity, as well as epiretinal membrane formation. In arterial phase of FFA, there was hypofluorescence of choroid background, retinal vascular was tortuous and telangiectatic, and there was leakage from vessels within the lesion in venous phase and late phase. OCT showed obscuration of the normal retinal layers, elevated lesion with high reflectivity of the inner retina, and hyporeflective shadowing of the underlying tissue. B ultrasound scan showed slightly elevated solid mass involving the disc or adjacent retina in some patients.
The anterior-posterior diameter of total ethmoid sinus was (39.02 +/- 4.89) mm. The horizontal diameter of anterior ethmoid sinus was (12.26 +/- 2.12) mm. The superior-inferior diameter of anterior ethmoid sinus was (11.89 +/- 2.56) mm. The anterior-posterior diameter of sphenoid sinus was (24.08 +/- 4.87) mm. The distance between the middle part of the lateral wall of sphenoid sinus and internal carotid artery was (1.23 +/- 0.56) mm; the angle between the initial section of ophthalmic artery and internal carotid artery was 54.33 degrees +/- 7.89 degrees . The distance between the medial margin of bilateral optic nerve at the frontal outlet was (14.26 +/- 3.23) mm.
No PVD was found in SEM disclosed group A and group D. Forty percent eyes were induced complete PVD in groups B, and one hundred percent eyes were induced complete PVD in group C. ERG and histology showed no toxicity changes in any group.
Corneal topography tests indicated that no significant difference for corneal astigmatism was found between these three groups preoperatively (F = 0.08, P &gt; 0.05). The corneal astigmatism was decomposed into J(0), J(45) and P with a Vector-based method, and statistically analyzed. When compared with Group B and GroupC, Group A had higher values of corneal J(0) (F = 9.54, P &lt; 0.01) and P (F = 18.69, P &lt; 0.01). For corneal J(0) and P, no significant difference was found between Group B and Group C (P &gt; 0.05). However groups and times had interactions (F = 13.45, 50.22, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). For astigmatic vectors, there were statistical significances between different times in 3 groups (F = 74.33, 92.11, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Wavefront aberration test results indicated that the mean values of RMSg (root mean square of general aberration), coma aberration, RMSh, RMS(3), RMS(5) and RMS(6) of Group A were obviously higher than that of Group B and C (F = 93.40, 471.94, 176.95, 216.99, 44.37, 37.19, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). And the values of RMS(4) and spherical aberration in Group A were significantly higher than that in Group C (q = 25.30, 26.23, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). No statistically significant was found between Group A and Group B of RMS(4) and spherical aberration (q = 0.57, 2.34, P &gt; 0.05, respectively). The values of RMS(4), RMSh, RMSg and spherical aberration in Group B were statistically significantly higher than that in Group C (q = 24.73, 7.90, 6.41, 23.89, P &lt; 0.01, respectively).
All donor lenticules were well adherent to the recipient posterior stroma and no graft dislocation occurred postoperatively. One patient had papillary block glaucoma at 1-day, and relieved after 48 hours postoperative. All grafts remained transparent, and had improved visual acuity. BSCVA was 0.3 - 0.7 postoperative. Six patients with preoperative pain had been pain free after DSEK procedure. Mean corneal astigmatism was (1.90 +/- 0.70) diopter (D). Mean ECD was (2014 +/- 192) cells/mm(2).
Proptosis, visual acuity and eye movement for pre- and post-treatment were observed. All the patients treated with 100% efficiency, in which 16 cases (57%) were complete resolution of the signs and symptoms, no proptosis with Valsalva and correct completely or partially enophthalmos, 12 cases (43%) marked resolution. Six patients partial resection as lesion was stiffen after glue injection, and can touch in anterior part of the orbit. Complications included the vision acuity loss (1 case), limitation of ocular movement (3 cases), and proptosis (2 cases).
The 9 cases, in which 7 cases were female, 7 cases had lesions on both eyes, demonstrated unpainful swelling of the lacrimal glands and in different degree of salivary glands or had history of tumor resection of salivary glands. Orbital CT scanning showed increased homogeneous density with clear boundary in the lacrimal gland area. Color doppler ultrasonography displayed elliptical space occupying with clear boundary and homogeneous internal echos of the lacrimal gland area. Six patients received treatment with large dose of glucocorticoid for 1 - 2 courses, and the symptoms and signs were significantly alleviated. Three patients were operated to excise the lacrimal gland masses due to imperfect treatment effect of medication or in order to make definite diagnosis. The postoperative pathological results supported the diagnosis of benign lymphoepithelial lesion. No recurrence happened in the follow-up.
The average graft survival time of Group B, C, D and E was (9.3 +/- 2.1), (21.1 +/- 7.3), (23.5 +/- 10.8) and (28.2 +/- 19.1) d respectively, Compared with Group B, Group C and D had a statistically significant prolongation of survival time (q = 10.24, 13.47; P &lt; 0.05). Though treated with 0.1% dexamethasone eye drops (Group E) prolonged transplant survival time as compared with mK5 eye drops, but the difference was not statistically significant (q = 2.54, 1.49; P &gt; 0.05). The occurrence of CNV in Group A was (3.1 +/- 0.8) d, Group B (2.6 +/- 0.5) d, Group C (6.4 +/- 0.5) d, Group D (7.8 +/- 0.7) d and Group E (5.3 +/- 1.0) d. Significant difference (q = 31.58, 51.21, 19.98; P &lt; 0.05) was found between groups C, D, E and Group A. There were also significant difference between groups C, D, E and Group B (q = 43.87, 67.14, 24.53; P &lt; 0.05). The CNV areas of Group C and Group D were also smaller than Group B (q = 30.76, 62.14; P &lt; 0.05). The results was similar compared with Group E (q = 15.20, 25.64; P &lt; 0.05). Fewer inflammatory cells and CNV were found in the cornea of the groups treated with mK5 eye drops.
In the study, the percentage of susceptibility for in vitro gram-positive bacterial isolates to tobramycin, ofloxacin, vancomycin and fusidic acid was 55.0%, 65.0%, 98.0% and 53.0%. The susceptibility to vancomycin was significantly higher than to tobramycin, ofloxacin and fusidic acid (chi(2) = 51.425, 36.113, 54.737; P &lt; 0.05). The susceptibility of common staphylococci to fusidic acid (85.5%) was just lower than to vancomycin (100.0%) (chi(2) = 6.605, P &lt; 0.05), but was significantly higher than to tobramycin (58.2%) and ofloxacin (54.5%) (chi(2) = 10.106, 12.511; P &lt; 0.05). The susceptibility of common streptococcus to fusidic acid (0.0%) was lower than to vancomycin (100.0%) and ofloxacin (85.0%) (chi(2) = 40.000, 29.565; P &lt; 0.05), but the susceptibility to fusidic acid and tobramycin (15.0%) were equivalent (chi(2) = 1.441, P &gt; 0.05). The gram-positive bacilli and nocardia showed significantly lower susceptibility to fusidic acid (24.0%) than that to the other three antibiotics (tobramycin 80.0%, ofloxacin 72.0%, vancomycin 92.0%) (chi(2) = 23.727, 22.430, 11.538; P &lt; 0.05).
The tenofovir group had significantly lower body and kidney weights than rats exposed to water or didanosine. Proximal but not distal tubules were of increased diameter and contained small lipid droplets. Tubular mitochondria were enlarged, and their crystal architecture was disrupted. Tenofovir-exposed kidneys contained low mtDNA copy numbers and impaired expression of mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX) I but not nucleus-encoded COX IV subunits. Histochemistry demonstrated low tubular COX and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH-DH) activities, whereas succinate dehydrogenase activity was preserved. COX activity was preserved in the glomeruli of tenofovir-exposed rats. Didanosine did not elicit renal effects but, unlike tenofovir, depleted mtDNA in liver (by 52%).
HIV testing rates rose from 4% in 2001 to 20% in 2006 (P &lt; 0.001) and were highest among pregnant females receiving provider-initiated testing. Yield for first-time testers decreased from 47% in 2001 to 28% in 2006; annual incidence of seroconversion among initially HIV-negative retesters was 1.9%. Median CD4 counts and World Health Organization stage distributions for newly diagnosed clients remained stable. HIV-infected clients receiving ART within 6 months of eligibility increased from 0% in 2001 to 68% in 2006 (P &lt; 0.001).
Most patients had high viral load (mean, 5.0 log copies/mL) and low CD4 cell counts (median, 260 CD4 cells/microL). Protease and/or reverse transcriptase sequences were obtained from 104 (72%) samples. Patients harbored subtypes C (80.8%), G (3.8%), CRF37_cpx (6.7%), untypable (U) (1.0%), and recombinant strains (7.7%) comprising the A, C, D, F, and U clades. There were no major protease inhibitor resistance mutations. Mutations conferring resistance to the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found in 4 (4/68; 5.9%) patients. Phylogenetic analysis suggested an imported origin for 2 resistant variants.
Although there are some differences between age groups, sexual mixing is primarily assortative for men of all ages, between completely random partner acquisition and fully assortative mixing, with greatest assortativity among middle-aged men. Men aged 25-34 years were shown to have the greatest level of sexual partner acquisition. There is little evidence to support disassortative mixing on average across the population.
In the DD group, dentin hardness was 10.4 +/- 1.6 KHN at 100 microm from the surface. In the sound dentin group, Knoop hardness was 51.0 +/- 1.6 KHN cross-sectionally throughout. No differences were observed from the surface to a depth of 2000 microm. In the DD group, dentin ablation volume at the superficial demineralized layer was 2888 +/- 272 x 10(4) microm. In the SD group, dentin ablation volume was 1298 +/- 219 microm(3). The relationship between ablation volume and Knoop hardness was defined as Y = -40.699x + 3350, revealing a marked negative correlation.
Peak response rates (&gt; 90%, maximal contraction) were observed at week 1 (treatment 1) and week 4 (treatments 2-5). The duration did not change with repeated treatments and was longer in the 20-U than in the 10-U group (17.1 +/- 6.58 weeks vs. 14.8 +/- 5.38 weeks; P &lt; 0.001). Subject-assessed improvement ratings, 4 weeks' post-treatment, were significantly higher ( P &lt; or = 0.05) in the 20-U group. Overall satisfaction ratings were significantly higher in the 20-U group ( P &lt; 0.001). No serious adverse events occurred. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected.
Participants spoke extremely highly of the care received, while interviews revealed more insightful and sometimes distressing information. A number of changes to service delivery were made as a result, including the introduction of a dedicated telephone line giving patients direct contact with the vascular nurse practitioner.
Thirtyone patients were included in the study. The operation indications were pancreas cancer for 17 patients, ampulla Vateri cancer for 8 patients, duodenum cancer for 3 patients, cancer of the distal choleduct for 2 patients and gall bladder cancer for 1 patient. Twenty complications had occurred in a total of 15 patients. There were no pancreaticojejunostomy anastomotic leakage and mortality in any of the patients.
Improvement of Contrast effect on stomach and duodenum in Esomeprazole group was 72.5% and in Ranitidine group was 28.6%. While image effect of pancreatic duct for Esomeprazole was 60% and for Ranitidine was 17.1%, and their statistical results were in concordance with p value (&lt; 0.01), but the image effect of the biliary tree didn't show any significant improvement or difference between imaging and statistical results.
The 5 years survival rate was 36% (median survival time, 34 months). Significant prognostic factors according to univariate analysis include pT classification, papillary type, number of metastatic lymph node, positive radial margin, pancreatic invasion, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, common hepatic node metastasis, paraaortic node metastasis, and combined vascular resection. Independent significant prognostic factors according to multivariate analysis include the number of metastatic lymph nodes (5 or more), positive radial margin, and common hepatic node metastasis.
Mean USBA in all patients before surgery was 39.8 +/- 64.0 micromol/L (median value was 6.6). USBA level was increased in patients with cholestasis. USBA level was significantly correlated with serum total bile acid, total bilirubin level and serum hyaluronic acid level (r = 0.850, 0.602 and 0.504, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05) and, furthermore, tended to be correlated with liver-uptake ratio (LHL15) by technetium-99m galactosyl human serum albumin (99SmTc-GSA) scintigraphy and alanine aminotransferase level (r = -0.469 and 0.436, respectively but not significant). USBA level tended to be associated with postoperative uncontrolled ascites (p = 0.050, not significant). Postoperative USBA level by day 7 was not changed; however, USBA level in patients with cholestatic diseases was decreased.
The patients of group 1 have shown a significant greater incidence of p.o. morbidity (20%) than group 2 (2.3%) (chi2 = 39.5; p &lt; 0.001), regardless to the type of cholecystectomy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy for lithiasis of common biliary duct seems an important risk factor (chi2 = 7.1; p &lt; 0.001). In group 2, the morbidity rate after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was lesser than after open surgery (X2=5.3; p &lt; 0.02). In both groups, postoperative hospital stay was longer after open cholecystectomy and endoscopic sphincterotomy.
No patient achieved CR, while five patients achieved PR as assessed by RECIST. The overall response rate from the intent-to-treat analysis was 21.4%. Stable disease was observed in 9 (64.3%) patients. Clinical benefit rate was observed in 14 (85.7%) patients. According to the tumor site, overall response rate was 20.0% in biliary tract carcinoma, on the other hand, 25.0% in gallbladder carcinoma.
Sixteen patients were diagnosed as having CDAD. All patients receiving endoscopic examination presented PMs. Two cases had PMs in the transverse and small intestine. The patients with ulcers needed 5-28 days of administration of VCM, while all those without ulcers except one were cured within seven days.
Preoperative serum levels of TPA (cut off level = 53 IU/L, Hazard ratio = 4.5, Wilcoxon test: p &lt; 0.01, Log-Rank test: p &lt; 0.03) and TPS (cut off level = 81 IU/L, Hazard ratio = 5.1, Wilcoxon test: p &lt; 0.007, Log-Rank test: p &lt; 0.009) were important for PS and DFI after liver resection (TPA: cut off level = 53 IU/L, Hazard ratio = 3.5, Wilcoxon test: n.s., Log-Rank test: n.s.; TPS: cut off level = 81 IU/l, Hazard ratio = 2.6, Wilcoxon test: p &lt; 0.02, Log-Rank: p &lt; 0.06). TPA serum levels were important for PS (Wilcoxon test--p &lt; 0.003, Log-Rank test--p &lt; 0.0002) and DFI after RFA (Wilcoxon test--p&lt; 0.001, Log-Rank Test--p &lt; 0.0001). TPS serum levels also correlated with PS (Wilcoxon test--p &lt; 0.005, Log-Rank test--p &lt; 0.003) and DFI after RFA (Wilcoxon test--p &lt; 0.001, Log-Rank Test--p&lt; 0.0001).
Of all 126 patients examined, 95 patients were receiving enteral nutrition. Multiple linear regression analysis using 18 clinical parameters revealed that disease activity was a dominant factor that affected the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients, and that enteral nutrition was also an independent factor that improved the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire total score, bowel symptoms, and systemic symptoms for patients with a disease duration of 10 years or more (P = 0.0090, 0.0033, and 0.016, respectively).
A significant improvement in HAI fibrosis staging was detected after therapy in all sustained viral responders (SVR) and non-responders (NR) patients. The percentages of cases with HAI scores and fibrosis staging decreased obviously were 100.0% and 71.4% in SVR patients and 50.0% and 42.9% in NR patients. The patients with combination therapy or normal ALT on 48w would more often receive the HAI and fibrosis staging decrease. The significantly lower alpha-SMA-positive HSCs and mean expression level of collagen type III were detected in the post-treatment biopsies. The HAI, alpha-SMA, collagen type III values were significantly correlated with the values of the semiquantitative indexes of fibrosis.
The alpha-tocopherol and p-nitrophenol were significantly better released from the respective glucosides and mannosides in cancer tissue than in "healthy" human colon tissues, with p = 0.000947 for la, p = 0.033024 for 1b; p = 0.0028 for 2a, and p = 0.0033 for 2b, respectively.
There was no significant correlation between serum levels of ROS and TP. Serum ROS levels were elevated in proportion to tumor invasion and had a significant positive correlation with tumor size (p &lt; 0.05). However, they did not increase in patients with liver metastasis.
G-CSF were significantly increased in the column inflow at 30 min compared with the baseline (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.01), and also increased through the column (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.01). The ratio of the increase in the column outflow at 60 min was 1.5-fold compared with the baseline. However, we could not show a significant relation between G-CSF level and clinical efficacy.
The operation time was a median of 85 (range 60-150) minutes for the SFEEA group compared with 130 (range 60-180) minutes for the DST group (p &lt; 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss was a median of 60 (range 10-520) ml for the SFEEA group compared with 40 (range 10-600) ml for the DST group. In the DST group, two postoperative complications (5%) occurred, leakage and stenosis respectively, compared with no complications in the SFEEA group. Only one suture line recurrence (2%) occurred in the DST group compared with no recurrence in the SFEEA group.
Down-regulation of the hexokinase II gene of LoVo cells resulted in decreased IC50 value of 5-fluorouracil and increased apoptosis rate, respectively. Furthermore, silencing hexokinase II of LoVo cells induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-3, and inhibition of thymidylate synthase expression.
(1) The mean basal CEA in CRC patients (17.3 ng% +/- 1.67) was significantly higher than control (3.41 ng% +/- 1.1). (2) A significant linear association between basal CEA and Dukes' classes was evident with the mean basal CEA for Dukes' A, B, C were 7.8, 12.7, 25.8 respectively (expressed as ng%). (3) The validity of basal CEA in primary CRC diagnosis was highly positive (sensitivity 80%--PPV 86.95%--accuracy 73.66%), with hig her efficacy in advanced disease detection (sensitivity 93%--NPV 7%--accuracy 84.5%--odds ratio 30.3) and negative exclusion power for DFS prediction (specificity 13.84%). (4) The basal CEA was a discriminate factor in colorectal prognosis - B value (3.74). (5) Patients with CEA &lt; or =5 ng% had better DFS (15%) and DFT (23.6 months) than those with CEA &gt; 5 ng% as they had DFS (33.75%) and DFT (18.48 months). (6) Basal CEA above 15 ng% had a significant shift in the cumulative hazard of recurrence.
A vascular enumeration, pN status and the time of presence of the metastases has shown prognostic role along with the factors above. Increased proliferative activity of the tumor as expressed by MIB-1 staining had no prognostic value, similarly to the localization of tumor, gender, age or grading.
No significant difference was seen in the number of thin vessels (&lt; or =10 microm) using immunohistochemical MVD analysis between LGDand hyperplasic polyps (p = 0.36). In contrast, the number of intermediate (11-20 microm) and thick vessels (&gt; or =21 microm) differed significantly between LGD and hyperplasic polyps, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.0001). In NBI findings, the presence of MC vessels was found in 98% (44 of 45) of LGD, while MC vessels were absent in 92% (23 of 25) of hyperplasic polyps.
There was no difference between the 2 groups with regard to operative blood loss, time to resumption of oral intake, and postoperative complications. The time required for the operation and for achieving anastomosis was shorter in the HDS group than in the HSA group. The rate of anastomotic stricture formation was not significantly different between the 2 groups, but was lower in the HDS group than in the HSA group.
Correlation was significant between the ZAP score and the LA classification (Spearman cor relation factor: 0.463). There were no significant differences in symptom according to the ZAP score. There were no significant differences in microscopic esophagitis between the patients with NERD (ZAP 0) and those with ERD (Erosive Reflux Disease, ZAP I, II, III). No statistical significance was observed between the ZAP score and the histology. In the diagnosis of NERD, ZAP classificationwas more accurate than LA classification in the basis of histology at distal esophagus (p &lt; 0.05).
The bleeding was stopped in 24 patients (96%). Rebleeding till day 42 was observed in 9 (36%) patients (5 in group A, 4 in group B, ns). 2 patients died in group B (due to rebleeding till day 5) and one in group A (rebleeding between day 5-10). Transfusion needs were lower in group B (2.7 +/- 2.6TU compared to 4.13 +/- 5.8 TU in group A, ns). Serious AE leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in 1 patient in group A (peripheral ischemia) and none in B, non-significant AE in 3 patients in group A (hypertension), and in 3 in group B (hypertension, hyponatremia, epiparoxysm).
The ABP was increased four hours after EVL in both groups, but there was no difference between the groups. There was a transient increase in HR and a decrease in SaO2 during endoscopy in both groups, but no difference of correspondent time points between the two groups. There was no difference in the bleeding rate between the two groups (9/47 vs. 10/47)
Duration of illness was nearly similar in the three groups (3.2 +/- 2.7:3.3 +/- 2.9:3.7 +/- 3.2 years). In group 1, typical symptoms improved in 66 (92.9%) cases and resolved in 63 (88.7%). In group 2, typical symptoms improved in 17 (94.4%) and resolved in 16 (88.9%), whereas atypical symptoms improved in 15 (83.3%) and resolved in 10 (55.6%). In group 3, atypical symptoms improved in 9 (81.8%) and resolved in 5 (45.5%). Endoscopic, radiologic, esophageal motility and pH metry studies were nearly similar in the 3 groups.
Stents were successfully placed across the anastomotic stenosis in all patients. Portal venous blood flow restored immediately after stent placement and liver dysfunction and consciousness loss resolved. Portal venous blood flow was maintained during the follow-up period ranging from 99 days to 765 days (mean, 438 days) in all patients.
COMT genotype distribution in the study subjects was 158Val/Val (51.2%), 84Val/Met (41.4%), and 15Met/Met (7.4%). It was within the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.73). In over all subjects, the degree of intestinal metaplasia tended to be lower among 158Met/Met when compared to Val/Val (Val/Val vs. Met/Met; 0.59 +/- 0.93 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.52, p = 0.052). Among H. pylori infected subjects, the degree of intestinal metaplasia was significantly lower among 158Met carriers in 50 years or older age (Val/Val vs. Met carriers; 1.20 +/- 1.06 vs. 0.75 +/- 1.08, p = 0.0436). No significant association was found between COMT genotypes and the degree of gastritis in different gender
There were no statistically significant differences in the patient characteristics between the two groups. In the laparoscopic group, non-resected procedures were significantly more frequent (p &lt; 0.05), blood loss was less (p &lt; 0.05), oral intake was started earlier (p &lt; 0.05) and the length of the skin incision was shorter (P &lt; 0.01). The C-reactive protein values and leukocyte counts were not significantly different in the two groups. The cosmetic results were very satisfactory in 11 patients (64.7%). There were no severe complications and no increase of the recurrence rate for laparoscopic surgery. Moreover, there was no definite clinical disadvantage and no prolonged operating time in the laparoscopic procedures.
The allele frequencies of TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, and TPMT*3C were 0, 0, 0, and 0.010 (17/1624), respectively. For the ITPA polymorphism, 173 subjects were heterozygous and 5 were homozygous for the 94C&gt;A missense mutation (allele frequency of A, 0.113). Moreover, the 87T&gt;C, IVS2+21A&gt;C, and IVS2+53C&gt;T polymorphisms were found in one patient each (1/1624), respectively. Of these, 87T&gt;C and IVS2+53C&gt;T were novel single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ITPA gene whose clinical significance should be further evaluated.
Baseline detection of HCV in platelets was found not to be related to therapy outcome. However, significant associations between detection rates of HCV in platelets and serum at the end-of-treatment (p = 0.0203), and 24 weeks after completion of therapy (p = 0.0016) were observed. Interestingly, HCV was detected in platelets from two patients with normal ALT who lost detectable serum HCV at the end-of-treatment and, after 24 weeks of followup, relapsed virologically in serum.
Thirty-six patients were eligible among 40 enrolled patients. Median survival time of eligible patients was 13.6 months (95% confidence interval, 8.7-18.9 months). Survival times of patients who ingested test food for a mean period of 47 weeks (range, 26 to 145 weeks) were significantly longer than that of patients who ingested for 7 to 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.05). The rates of lentinan-binding cells in CD14+ monocytes showed individual variations (0.1-19.7%; Median, 1.6%). Survival times (median survival time, 16.3 months) of lentinan-high-binding group were significantly longer than those (median survival time, 12.5 months) of lentinan-low-binding group (p &lt; 0.05).
The average times of clamping in Group 1 was 1.6 +/- 0.7, but only one clamping in Group 2 and 3. There were significant differences among three groups in bleeding volume as well. The postoperative serum ALT and total bilirubin (TBIL) in Group 2 and 3 were significantly lower than those of Group 1.5 patients died of liver failure after operation in Group 1. But liver failure or morbidity wasn't happened in Group 2 and 3. The rates of biliary leakage in Group 1 and 2 were more than that of Group 3. The hospitalization duration of Group 1 was significantly longer than those of Group 2 and 3.
By comparing the control group, patient demographics were not different. Four patients underwent left lateral sectionectomy and others underwent partial hepatectomy. One patient needed combined resection of abdominal wall and left lateral sector because of direct invasion from a liver tumor. There was no remarkable morbidity or mortality in all patients. Mean operation time in the LAPH group was significantly longer than that in the control group (356 +/- 68 vs. 276 +/- 59 minutes) (p = 0.015), particularly in patients undergoing partial resection. Blood loss was not different between groups. Days of use of pain reliever and hospital stay in the LAPH group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). These tendencies were similar in each operative procedure.
Mean levels of serum hsCRP were 68.4 mg/dl, 68.3 mg/dl and 6.5 mg/dl in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Those levels were significantly higher in Groups 1 and 2 compared to Group 3 (p &lt; 0.0001). After the 2nd day of ceftriaxone, serum hsCRP decreased to a mean level of 9.0 mg/dl in Group 1 and to 9.1 mg/dl in Group 2.
Were included 45 patients (control group: 26, MARS group: 19). Comparison between groups showed only differences in plasma bilirrubin levels in the first 24 hours. ICU mortality was 52.63% in the treatment group and 42.3% in the control group (p = 0.49). In the control group 17 patients (65.4%) received a liver transplant and 11 (57.9%) in the MARS group. ICU mortality was lower for transplanted patients in the study group (27.27% vs. 87.5%) (p = 0.019). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicate that MARS-treated patients before liver transplantation had better survival.
After 3 months of treatment, 97 patients showed normal transaminases and were negative for HCV-RNA. ABT and GEC as parameters of microsomal and cytosolic liver function were reduced in all patients before therapy initiation and returned to normal values in the therapy responders after 3 months. Parameters of liver perfusion (SCl and ICG) require one year of treatment before returning to normal levels. In non-responders, QTLF did not change during therapy, in relapsers, QTLF results deteriorated after ending the therapy.
Complete follow-up was achieved in 240 patients and 11 (4.6%) became chronic carriers. Only alcohol addiction other than epidemiological, clinical or biochemical parameters was found to be significantly associated with chronic evaluation. In serum samples collected from 205 of 240 patients 3 months after the onset of infection, hepatitis B surface antigen clearance was observed in 181 (88.3%). Number of patients increased to 194 (94.6%) at the end of 6 month and both of these rates were found to be highly significant.
Three hours after I-R injury, AST levels in the Vehicle, EPO5000x3, EPO5000x1, and EPO500 x3 groups were 1494.2 +/- 711.3 U/L, 307.3 +/- 127.6 UL, 296.5 +/- 9.2 U/L, and 474.6 +/- 242.0 UL, respectively (one-factor ANOVA, p = 0.020). At 3h the ALT and LDH levels in the Vehicle group were significantly higher than those in the EPO5000x3 and EPO5000x1 groups. Apoptotic indices in the Vehicle, EPO500x3, EPO5000x1, and EPO500x3 groups 3 h after I-R injury were 2.40 +/- 0.93, 1.36 +/- 0.12, 1.11 +/- 0.17, and 1.51 +/- 0.33, respectively. The apoptotic indices of the EPO5000x1 and EPO500x3 groups were significantly lower than that of the Vehicle group.
A complete response and partial response were recorded for 5 and 14 patients, respectively. The response rate was 83%; it was significantly higher in patients who had received &gt; or =58 Gy10 rather than &lt;58 Gy10 (P = 0.014). The median survival time was 19 months. Univariate analysis revealed that the Child-Pugh's classification, status of the liver tumor, and LN metastasis site were significant factors for survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the status of the liver tumor was the only independent predictor of survival.
MTT assays showed growth inhibitions by phosphatidylcholine dose-dependently. Ratios of sub-G1 phase cell population by FACScan significantly increased on 48h phosphatidylcholine stimulation in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Fas or TNF-alpha ligand followed by phosphatidylcholine stimulation significantly increased apoptotic cells more than by phosphatidylcholine alone (p &lt; 0.05). Enhanced appearances of cleaved caspase-8, -3 and fragmented PARP were shown on immunoblotting and apoptotic cells on TUNEL staining after phosphatidylcholine stimulation. Phosphatidylcholine was assumed to reduce hepatic carcinogenesis by apoptosis induction via the death ligands (Fas and/or TNF-alpha) pathway followed by caspase-8 and -3 inductions.
The time-course change in hemoglobin did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, significantly greater reductions in both neutrophil and platelet counts were observed with PEG-IFN alpha-2a compared to PEG-IFN alpha-2b. A slightly longer period was required with PEG-IFN alpha-2a than with PEG-IFN alpha-2b for a reduction in neutrophil or platelet count large enough to necessitate dose reduction.
Hemorrhage was controlled in all cases with no death rate. Portal vein thrombosis in 3.6% (2/56), and pleurorrhea in 8.9% (5/56) of cases. In-hospital morbidity was 12.5% (7/56). Complete eradication of varices was observed in 87.5% (49/56) patients. Recurrent variceal bleeding was noticed in 8.9% (5/56) of cases. No patient developed encephalopathy until one month postoperatively. 42 patients were followed up postoperatively for three years. The 3-year survival for patients with Child-Pugh A was 100% (32/32), B was 71.4% (5/7), and 33%(1/3) for C.
In the malignant group, it was observed a larger tumor size (47.8 vs. 23.8 mm; p = 0.001) and increased dilation of the MPD (9.3 vs. 5.0 mm; p = 0.001) than those seen in the benign group. The accuracy of CT diagnosis of mural nodules, however, was only 62%. Tumor diameter &gt; or =40 mm or MPD diameter &gt;10 mm predicted malignancy with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 93.8% and 95.7%, respectively.
The incidence of pancreatic fistula in these patients was 18%. Multivariate analysis identified 4 independent parameters correlating with occurrence of pancreatic fistula: (1) no use with ultrasonically activated scalpel on the pancreatic transaction (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.8; p = 0.001); (2) no performance with duct-to-mucosa anastomosis for pancreatico-enteric reconstruction (4.3; 1.1-16.1; p = 0.006); (3) not having early postoperative enteral nutrition through the jejunostomy catheter (2.3; 1.1-5.0; p = 0.007); and (4) serum amylase concentration greater than 194 U/L (1.7 times the normal upper limit) on the first postoperative day (2.0; 1.1-3.9; p = 0.019).
Arterial infusion via two routes reduced the mortality rate and improved Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. The overall mortality rate was 11.8%. The mortality rate in patients in whom were treated within 3days after the onset was significantly lower than that in patients in whom were treated without 3days after the onset.
The introduction of MD-CT had a significant impact on the selection of suitable patients, this group showing a lower frequency of surgical intervention in cases of incurable disease (p = 0.0383). Pre-operative evaluation using MD-CT in the resected cases also provided a higher percentage of accurate R0/R1 grading relative to SD-CT evaluations (p = 0.0164).
One patient had injury to the main pancreatic duct during surgery, and transient pancreatic fistula of grade B occurred. In this patient, ENPD tube was left in place for the management the pancreatic fistula, resulted in a favorable outcome. Other 5 patients showed no postoperative complications including pancreatic fistula.
PSVT occurred in 5 of the 17 patients (29%), none of them were symptomatic throughout follow-up. PSVT disappeared spontaneously in 2 of the 5 patients (40%) without any treatment. Patients with PSVT showed significant differences in comparison with patients without PSVT in age, preoperative platelet count, intraoperative bleeding,splenic weight and platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (PAIgG), CONCLUSIONS: PSVT occured at a high rate in patients after splenectomy, but at a lower than in patients with hematopathies. According to our results, thrombolytic agent may be required only when patients show symptoms of PSVT. Preoperative serum PAIgG level may represent worthwhile markers for predicting PSVT.
Most lesions (16/17) exhibited the differentiated type. In 8 first cancers, the lesions were divided phenotypically into 2 G, 4 GI, 1 I, and 1 N types. In 9 second/third cancers, the lesions were divided phenotypically into 3 G, 1 GI, 4 I, and 1 N types. The first lesions (6/8) had more gastric phenotypic expression compared with the second/third ones (4/9) in the MGCs, although there was no significant difference between two groups (P = 0.28).
There were individual variations in the binding ratio of LNT to monocytes from 0.16% to 11.95%. Toxicity with chemotherapy was not improved in the LNT 12-wk group, however, the total QOL score was significantly elevated in the LNT 12-wk group (p = 0.018) but not in the LNT 6-wk group.
The average pH during the 4-hour period after administration of famotidine was higher than after lansoprazole (median: 5.15 versus 3.55, respectively; p = 0.0376). During the 4-hour study period, famotidine 20 mg provided a longer duration of pH &gt; 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6 and 7, compared to lansoprazole 30 mg (median: 73.6% versus 57.0%; p = 0.0414, 66.8% versus 47.8%; p = 0.0281, 60.8% versus 38.8%; p = 0.0150, 55.7% versus 29.7%; p = 0.0281, 45.0% versus 23.1%; p = 0.0414 and 23.9% versus 3.65%; p = 0.0076).
Twenty patients were evaluable for response. One case of (5%) complete response, seven of (35%) partial response, nine (45%) of stable disease, and three (15%) of progressive disease were observed, giving an overall treatment response rate of 40%. Median survival time was 9.4 months, median progression-free survival was 6.1 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 25%. Both hematologic and non-hemotologic toxicities were well tolerated and no treatment-related deaths occurred. In patients who received Chloroxoquinoline maintenance monotherapy after six cycles of the combination regimen, progression-free survival was nine months.
The mean amount of sucrose excreted into urine in HV, GU, EGC, and AGC was 50.8 +/- 28.0 mg, 225.9 +/- 201.1 mg, 170.2 +/- 86.4 mg, and 426.2 +/- 155.0 mg, respectively, showing significant differences between HV and gastric disease groups (p &lt; 0.01). The sensitivity for detecting GU, EGC, and AGC was 94.4%, 88.0%, and 100%, respectively. Sucrose excretion in GU and EGC was significantly decreased after treatment (262.4 +/- 121.2 to 80.6 +/- 42.1, and 246.0 +/- 136.9 to 139.1 +/- 69.2, p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).
Fourteen out of 16 SPECT findings were pathologic, showing decreased focal frontal/temporal/temporoparietal cerebral blood perfusion. Aminoacidopathic group--all the 3 patients revealed pathologic signs from the aminoacidopathic patients' group. Among them the ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) heterozygous female patient with left-sided hemiparesis caused by hyperammonemic stroke at 10 month-age, showed right sided temporoparietal, occipital and left frontal hypoperfusion, nearly 6 years after the cerebral vascular attack. This finding might be resulted because of diaschisis. Mitochondrial encephalo-myopathic (MEMP) group--all the four patients with MEMP and lactic acidosis showed focal hypoperfusion in the temporal region, while the perfusion was normal in the COX deficient patient and in 2 Leigh's disease (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy) patients. In the remaining 1 Leigh's patient frontotemporal hypoperfusion was found. In all patients there were non specific structural abnormalities detected by MRI: cortical and subcortical atrophy, and scattered demyelination foci. In the case of ceroid lipofuscinosis the MRI showed cerebral atrophy and cerebellar hypoplasia, and the SPECT showed right frontal and occipital hypoperfusion, bilateral parietal physiological riping process. The patient with tuberous sclerosis showed bilateral temporo-occipital hypoperfusion.
A total of 109 episodes of sepsis were identified in 100 neonates. The incidence of sepsis was 4.06% among all NICU admissions. Most neonates with early-onset sepsis were term infants, while very low birth weight (VLBW) and preterm infants accounted for the majority of cases of late-onset sepsis. In early-onset sepsis, the most common pathogens responsible included group B streptococci (GBS) (36%) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) (26%). GBS was associated with more meningitis involvement but lower incidence of mortality compared with E. coli. The most common causative microorganisms in late-onset sepsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (40%) and Candida (15%). The sepsis-related mortality rates were higher in early-onset sepsis (10%) than in late-onset sepsis (7%).
During the study period, 145 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for scrub typhus, of whom 106 (73%) were adults and 39 (27%) were children. The mean age of the children was 7.6+/-4.6 years. The most common clinical manifestations of pediatric scrub typhus were fever (n=39; 100%), cough (n=28; 72%), anorexia (72%), eschar (69%), chill (67%) and lymphadenopathy (64%). The most common complications were hepatic dysfunction (77%) and pneumonitis (54%). Three children (8%) required intensive care, but the overall survival rate was 97%. One child died with multi-organ failure within 8 hours after admission.
Generalized lipodystrophy was noted in all patients except for regions such as the cheeks, hands and feet. All cases had failure to thrive, microcephaly, ear dysplasia, laryngomalacia, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, constipation, abnormal dentition, dermatitis/acrodermatitis enteropathica, hyperpigmentation of the skin, very low insulin-like growth factor I levels with delayed bone age, relative hypolipidemia, initial camptodactyly/joint contracture, progressive kyphoscoliosis, osteoporosis with loose joints, ventriculomegaly, and generalized organic aciduria. Other findings included inguinal hernia, hypothyroidism or persistent hyperthyrotropinemia, cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, growth hormone deficiency, cloudy cornea with congenital glaucoma, neonatal teeth, cardiac defects, basal ganglia calcification and seizure disorder. These patients with NPS did not show hyperinsulinemia or dyslipidemia. Their karyotypes were all normal, while the chromosomal breakage test showed markedly increased breakage rates in four patients. LMNA, ERCC8, or ZMPSTE24 gene mutations could not account for the disorders in these patients. Four patients died after sepsis or aspiration pneumonia at the age of 1.1, 4, 6.2 and 7.5 years.
Infants in the liberal group received a larger PRBC transfusion volume compared with the restrictive group over 30 days (41.7+/-20.1 vs. 27.2+/-15.9mL, p=0.029). There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, ROP or CLD between the two groups. The laboratory data, except reticulocyte count, showed no significant difference on day 30. Further analysis of premature babies with and without CLD showed that total transfused blood volume greater than 30mL over 30 days was a risk factor for developing CLD in VLBW infants.
The pylorus still appeared hypertrophied after pyloromyotomy on the sonograms. The traditional measurement of linear dimensions of the pylorus was not significantly changed from the preoperative values by the time of discharge, except for muscle thickness. The intermuscular space increased from 4.8+/-0.8 mm preoperatively to 7.3+/-2.1 mm by postoperative day 3 (p=0.10). Lowe's pyloric ratio at diagnosis was a mean of 0.32, decreasing to 0.29 on postoperative day 3 and 0.29 on the day of discharge (p=0.82). The alternative pyloric ratio increased significantly by postoperative day 2 (0.24+/-0.09 on day 2 vs. 0.11+/-0.07 preoperatively, p=0.02).
The islet yield per gram of pancreas was 1452 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 125) for the PTX group and 384 (SD +/- 115) for the control non-PTX group (p&lt;0.01). Viability of islets for individual isolations did not reveal any statistically significant differences between groups and was estimated at 85-93%. Three out of five animals demonstrated normoglycemia with features of neoangiogenesis in the islets transplanted into the liver, which was confirmed by histological examination. One animal developed hyperglycemia up to 430 mg/dl, and histological image showed intensive apoptosis and degranulation in the transplanted islets.
There were no clinical complications associated with the use of icodextrin fluid during the study. A significant increase in intraperitoneal volume of dialysate (950 ml on average) compared to the initial value was observed in the whole group at the 16th hour of the exchange.
The capsules coated with APH are more resistant than the capsules coated with APA. After transplantation of the islets immunoisolated with APA, euglycemia is maintained longer than after transplantation of the islets immunoisolated with APH. Microencapsulation protects the islets from destruction by the host.
Italy ranked 5th, with the US ranking 1st, over the entire study period for number of cancer publications, which increased over that period. Italy ranked 4th in 2006-2007 for GDP-adjusted and 5th for population-adjusted publication number, loosing ground in the GDP-adjusted ranking and gaining ground in the population-adjusted ranking over the study period. When the quality of research publications was considered, in 2006-2007 Italy was in 5th place for crude TIF (US 1st), in 4th place for GDP-adjusted TIF (Sweden 1st), and in 6th place for population-adjusted TIF (Sweden 1st). Over the study period, Italy was stable for crude and population-adjusted TIF but declined somewhat for GDP-adjusted TIF.
In 2002, there were about 8000 incident cases and 26,800 prevalent cases of kidney cancer in Italy. Of these, approximately 6800 and 22,750 were incident and prevalent cases of renal cell cancer, respectively. The most reliable estimate of incident kidney cancer cases in Italy over the period 2007-2012 is likely to range between 7000 and 9000. Of these, between 6000 and 8000 are renal cell cancer cases. The best estimate of prevalence of kidney cancer is between 20,000 and 34,000 cases and that of renal cell cancer between 17,000 and 29,000 cases.
An estimated 2,927 new cases of cervical cancer occurred in Italy in 2005 (crude incidence 9.7/100,000; world age-standardized incidence 6.0/100,000). The estimated numbers of new cases by FIGO stage were: FIGO I, 1,927; FIGO II, 556; FIGO III, 259; and FIGO IV, 185. Costs for the most frequent procedures were estimated as: Euro 6,041 for radical hysterectomy or other surgery; Euro 4,901 for radio-chemotherapy; Euro 1,588 for brachytherapy; and Euro 3,795 for palliative chemotherapy. Mean management costs for incident cases (including 10 years of follow-up) were estimated at: FIGO I, Euro 6,024; FIGO II, Euro 10,572; FIGO III, Euro 11,367; FIGO IV, Euro 8707; and Euro 5,854 for the terminal phase (1 month). The total direct management cost was estimated at Euro 28.3 million per year.
The literature review identified 157 additional cases, and a total of 164 cases had been analyzed. In this series, only 30% had a successful non-operative diagnosis. The curative rate of the surgery-adjuvant chemotherapy group was higher than that of the chemotherapy alone group.
No grade 3 toxicity was observed. Acute and late grade 2 toxicity rates were 5.8% and 9.0% for rectum and 12.5% and 2.0% for bladder, respectively. Rectal V70 influenced the occurrence of late grade 2 toxicity. A relationship between acute and late urinary toxicity was also found. After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 20-50), the actuarial overall and biochemical relapse-free survival rates were 84% and 77%, respectively, with a significant difference between low-intermediate and high-risk patients.
Standardize maximum uptake at PET1 (7.9 +/- 4.8), PET2 (5.1 +/- 4.1) and PET3 (2.7 +/- 3.1) were all significantly (P &lt; 0.05; ANOVA repeated measures) lower than at PET0 (16.1 +/- 10.1). Standardized maximum uptake at PET1 was significantly higher than at both PET2 and PET3. There were no significant differences in SUV(max) between PET2 and PET3. PET3 identified 4 complete and 2 partial metabolic responses, whereas PET1 identified 6 partial metabolic responses. Radiotherapy-induced increased [l8F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake could be visually distinguished from tumor uptake based on PET/CT integration and was less frequent at PET1 (n = 2) than at PET3 (n = 6).
The 5-year overall survival rate of all patients was 68.5%. The overall survival of patients with N1, N2, and N3 stage was 100%, 68.0%, and 40.9%, respectively (P = 0.026). The overall survival of patients irradiated by ipsilateral neck, bilateral neck, and extensive field was 66.5%, 74.5%, and 54.6%, respectively (P = 0.5). At multivariate analysis, only N stage significantly affected overall survival (P = 0.032). The 5-year neck control rate of all patients was 65.6%. The neck control rate of patients with N1, N2, and N3 stage was 100%, 63.2%, and 34.6%, respectively (P = 0.064). The neck control rate of patients irradiated by ipsilateral neck, bilateral neck, and extensive field was 87.6%, 51.1%, and 72.7%, respectively (P = 0.279). Emergence of the occult primary was observed in 21.2% patients, and all of these occurred within the head and neck region. The primary tumor emerged in 23.3% of patients treated with ipsilateral and bilateral neck irradiation and in 12.5% of patients irradiated by extensive field (P = 0.469).
The median overall survival was 16.7 months. The overall survival significantly increased in the adjuvant temozolomide group compared to the group with no adjuvant therapy (18.9 vs 9.8 months). The difference in overall survival between adjuvant temozolomide cycles of &lt; or = and &gt; 3 was significant (8.7 vs 20 months). On multivariate analyses, the important prognostic factors were type of surgery and application of adjuvant temozolomide for at least 4 cycles. Grade III/IV toxicity was seen in 4% and 6.5% of patients during concomitant and adjuvant therapy, respectively.
Overall 5- and 10-year survival was 93% and 47%, respectively. Local control was 93.5% at 5 and was unchanged at 10 years. Grade 2 acute cutaneous and mucous toxicity was 41% and 62%, and grade 3, 6.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Only one patient required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy due to severe dysphagia and one patient required temporary tracheostomy for severe acute laryngeal edema (grade 3). Two patients experienced late toxicity greater than grade 3. The median dose to the residual larynx was 59.5 Gy (range, 45-70.2), and the median dose to the neck was 50.4 Gy (range, 39.6 -55.8).
The median follow-up was 52 months (range, 15-142 months). The overall survival rates of the patients were 100%, 96%, and 87% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. At the time of the study analysis, 21 of 57 (37%) patients had recurrent disease. The median time to recurrence was 16 months. Recurrences were most frequent in the pelvis and abdominal cavity (38%). Age, menopausal status, stage at diagnosis, and residual tumor volume after initial surgery were significantly related to the risk of recurrence in univariate analysis (P = 0.039, 0.038, 0.004, and 0.000, respectively). Residual tumor volume after initial surgery was found to be the only significant independent prognostic factor (P = 0.049, HR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.02-0.99).
Forty-one percent of sexually active patients had experienced a deterioration of sexual functioning after treatment. This was mainly due to loss of libido (80%), loss of interest in partner (54%), and sexual dissatisfaction (59%). Problems tended to develop early in the course of treatment. Decreased sexual desire was significantly more frequent in patients undergoing mastectomy versus BCT (80% vs 61%; P = 0.043) and in premenopausal versus postmenopausal patients (P = 0.024). Although 80% of patients were satisfied with their appearance as a whole, only 54% liked their naked bodies. There was no significant difference in body image scores between patients undergoing mastectomy or BCT apart from a general feeling of physical unattractiveness in mastectomy patients (3.4 vs 2.8; P = 0.03).
Under base-case assumptions, pegfilgrastim was cost-effective compared to six-day filgrastim in Italy. The estimated cost, life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years per person for pegfilgrastim were Euro 3078, 16.47 years, and 15.32; the corresponding figures for six-day filgrastim were Euro 3033, 16.35 years, and 15.22. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with pegfilgrastim was Euro 409 per life-year gained and Euro 429 per quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to the relative risk of FN for 6-day filgrastim versus pegfilgrastim. The results were moderately sensitive to the cost of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim, cost of drug administration, cost of FN hospitalization, and number of chemotherapy cycles. Pegfilgrastim remained cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well below the accepted limit of Euro 50,000 per life year gained in all one-way sensitivity analyses. A two-way sensitivity analysis on cost of drugs showed a range of pegfilgrastim dominance over six-day filgrastim.
A higher proportion of mammary tumors expressed GLUT-1 and transglutaminase 2 in the chemoprevention group. Claudin-1 expression was absent in all tumors of both groups.
All the recommendations were followed by a level of evidence (LE) and a degree of recommendation (DR). We used a formal ranking system to help the reader to judge the strength of the evidence behind the results published in support of each recommendation.
In our study, we found a relationship, using a univariate analysis, between treatment with statins and the presence of insignificant carcinoma in the group with low or intermediate risk of recurrence. However, this relationship is not independent when we applied a multivariate analysis.
None of the 16 patients evaluated presented lower urinary tract symptoms nor urinary incontinence. Medical complications observed in patients were: dysuria, erectile dysfunction, scrotal ecchymosis and urinary retention. The cases of dysuria, scrotal ecchymosis and urinary retention observed were of short-duration, the last one with spontaneous resolution after 7 days of vesical catheterism. The patient presenting erectile dysfunction had a good response to oral type 5 fosfodiesterase inhibitor three times a week, after a six month period.
The diagnosis of bladder cancer depends on cystoscopy and histologic evaluation of the resected tissue. A complete and correct transurethral resection (TUR) is essential for the prognosis of the patient. When the initial resection is incomplete or when a high-grade or T1 tumour is detected, a second TUR within 2-6 wk should be performed. The short- and long-term risks of both recurrence and progression may be estimated for individual patients using the scoring system and risk tables. The stratification of patients to low, intermediate, and high-risk groups-separately for recurrence and progression-represents the cornerstone for indication of adjuvant treatment. In patients at low risk of tumour recurrence and progression, one immediate instillation of chemotherapy is strongly recommended. In those at an intermediate or high risk of recurrence and an intermediate risk of progression, one immediate instillation of chemotherapy should be followed by further instillations of chemotherapy or a minimum of 1 yr of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). In patients at high risk of tumour progression, after an immediate instillation of chemotherapy, intravesical BCG for at least 1 yr is indicated. Immediate cystectomy may be offered to the highest risk patients and in patients with BCG failure. The long version of the guidelines is available on www.uroweb.org.
The mean age was 54 years, range from 16 to 79. The thrombus was classified as level I -- 13.5%, level II -- 40%, level III -- 26.5% and level IV -- 20%. Surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in six (40%) cases, three (50%) without sternotomy. There was one (13%) death during the intraoperative period; this patient presented extensive metastatic tumor, with the thrombus reaching the right atrium. Patients with lymph node or metastatic disease at initial presentation had poorer overall survival in Kaplan-Meier curve. Both, tumor stage (p = 0.380), and thrombus extension (p = 0.174) were not related to survival.
Patients treated with sildenafil in fixed doses presented a 60% full erection recovery 9 months after radical prostatectomy. In the case where patients underwent bilateral or unilateral nerve sparing, they got a successful rate of almost 90%. Even 20% of those patients who did not have a nerve preservation got satisfactory erections,
Cystic dysplasia of the testis (CDT) is a rare benign disease, associated with upper urinary tract malformations. Its most frequent clinical manifestation is the increase of testicular size; the presence of cysts is demonstrated by ultrasound. No consensus exists in its treatment, it oftenly requires histological confirmation, performing testicle-sparing surgery.
Since the only (unique) prominent information seems to concern the metabolism of the carbohydrates increasing the efficiency of the insulin.
The cure rate was 94,7% and recurrence rate was 5,3%. No visceral, nerurovascular injuries were observed. The mesh exposure rate (less than 1 cm2) was (14.7%) and all patients were treated conservatively with no impact on the outcome. There were transient dyspareunia in 2 (11.8%) of the 17 sexually active patient and persistent in 1 case (5.9%).
Urinary infection was the most frequent medical record found. Mean time since start of UI symptoms was 4 years and 44% of patients had been received some treatment for UI. It was observed a higher use of sanitary napkins (63.9%) than pantyliners (36%) and diapers (11.2%). Mean global score of the KHQ was 42.2 (S.D.= 18.7); higher impact on HRQoL was shown in dimensions: UI impact, Urinary problems and Physical Limitations. Urge UI symptoms cause higher impact on HRQoL than Stress UI symptoms (p&lt; 0.0001). The logistic regression model performed for global KHQ score showed that variables strongly associated were Urge UI, genital prolapse and coital UI symptom.
The average age of the patients was 7.7 years, the average follow up was 30.6 months, and all the patients were male with a posterior urethral rupture. 27 Patients underwent a primary urethral repair (63%), 13 patients underwent a cistostomy with later urologic reconstruction (30%), in 3 patients (7%) other surgical procedures were made. Overall complication rate was 39.5%. These complications were: Urethral stenosis, 26 patients (60.5%), urinary retention secondary to obstruction, 10 patients (23.3%), incontinence 10 patients (23.3%) and impotence 7 patients (16.3%). Patients treated with a primary urethral repair presented a significantly less development of infection, obstruction and stenosis, (p&lt;0.05). Patients with pelvis fracture associated to urethral trauma had a significant higher risk of developing stenosis and impotence. (p&lt;0.05).
The mean duration of the intervention was 36.4 +/- 15.5 minutes. During the intervention, in 2 patients the placement of the stent was not possible. The time of revenue was 48 hours in all the patients except in 1 of them. The analgesic needs were exclusively non steroid antiinflammatorys. The double J stent was withdrawn with cystoscopy. In 3 patients there were postoperatory complications: a migration of the stent, a urinary infection and an urinoma. In 1 patient with worsening of hydronephrosis was needed of pyeloplasty. In the controls the disappearance of the hydronephrosis was observed in all the cases, eliminating likewise the expansion of the renal calyces. The diuretic renography improved in all babies, being the boss of the curve normal in 14 cases and semi obstructively in 2. The mean time of elimination was 9.8 +/- 2.8 minutes.
In 64,8% (35/54) of the cases a metabolic abnormality was observed and in 27,7% (15/54) there was 2 or more alterations present. The metabolic disorders most frequently observed were hypercalciuria (15/54) 27,7%, hypocitraturia (15/54) 27,7%, hyperuricemia (8/54) 14,8%. and hyperoxaluria (8/54) 14,8%. There was no significant difference in age or sex between the groups with and without metabolic abnormality.
By the prostate rectal examination the gland felt hard and with no well defined limits. The transrectal ultrasound showed heterogene parenchyma and several hyperechoic areas by a bad circumscribed prostate. The pathological analysis reported a diffuse infiltration of the gland by chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.
Fifty-four patients were enrolled. A statistically significant attenuation of the postintubation hemodynamic response was observed in the remifentanil group. The effect was evident on arterial pressure (P=.0001) and heart rate (P=.031) with respect to baseline values. That protective effect was not seen in the fentanyl group. No differences in peripheral blood oxyhemoglobin saturation were observed.
In the analysis of the therapeutic range in the overall group we identified statistically significant differences between decubitus and standing positions and between decubitus position and walking. At the level of the thoracic spine differences were identified between all positions except between standing and walking and between seated and decubitus positions. At the level of the cervical spine, no significant differences were detected. Analysis of the pulse charge showed a significant difference in the decubitus position, in which less charge was needed to achieve satisfactory stimulation. When electrodes implanted at the cervical and thoracic levels were compared, differences were found between standing and seated positions (P=.04) but none between decubitus position or walking and the other positions.
Overall 126 (42%) HSTs across all levels of training and subspecialty interests responded. Only 50.8% stated they had received formal diathermy training whereas 49.2% had no formal training. Diathermy is used by 23.8% of responders for laparotomy skin incisions, while 76.2% use a scalpel. For colonic mobilisation, 49.2% use diathermy and 50.8% scissors. For rectal mobilisation 55.5% use diathermy, 42.9% scissors and 1.6% a harmonic scalpel. Nearly 90% of responders do not place diathermy pads on the patient themselves, 68.3% do not routinely check diathermy equipment before use and 66.7% do not check the diathermy pad site at the end of the operation. Only 80.9% stated that a diathermy complication is the surgeon's responsibility, while the remaining 19.1% would blame the scrub nurse, circulating nurse, operating department assistant (ODA), manufacturer or a combination of the above.
Sixty patients were studied in the study period. The male to female ratio was 5:1. The age range was 20-75 years with mean 47+17.4 (SD) years. The socioeconomic status of patients was poor (the average income was less than $50 per week) in 36 (60%) and 24 (40%) were middle class (the average income being $50-100 per week). Thirty-nine patients (65%) presented in the hot humid months of the year. Extent of the disease was scrotum in 18 patients (30%), perineum in 30 (50%) and abdominal wall in 12 (20%). Systemic predisposing factors identified in our study were diabetes mellitus in 20 (33.33%) patients, chronic alcohol abuse in two (3.33%) and long-standing steroid therapy in four (6.67%) while in 34 patients (56.67%) no cause was identified. The local aetiological origin of Fournier's gangrene was urogenital in 14 (23.33%) patients, anorectal in 10 (16.67%) and cutaneous in 8 (13.33%) and no local pathologies could be identified in 28 (46.67%) patients. The mean time interval between first symptom and initial treatment was 2.5 days with a range of 1-7 days. Number of debridement sessions per patient was 2-6 (mean, 3.15). Mean hospital stay was 31+7 (SD) with a range of 10-50 days. Morbidity was 80%. Four patients (6.67%) died. Three of these patients presented to hospital 5-6 days too late.
Four patients were found not to have renal duplication. There was concordance between the IVU and DMSA scan in seven. Additional clinically relevant information was obtained in three cases. A false negative result from the DMSA scan was found in four children and a false positive result in three.
The mean follow-up for this sample was 50 months. The overall rate of recurrence was 6%, one-third of which were invasive. The estimated eight year disease free survival was 91.6%.
The maps made before dialysis are characterised by large, unsymmetrical isopotential lines changes over the left and right ventricle. After carried out of hemodialysis the image of ECG records was improving. In all of cases the isoline distribution in sternal and anterior lower left part of chest comes back to norm. Changes are visible merely over the left ventricle and in anterior upper right part of chest what is connected with just stabilised conducting disturbances in the left branch of His bundle, left bundle of fasciculus atrioventricularis (His bundle).
Elevated pulse pressure was found in 17 (35.42%) patients: in 11 with SHN and in 6 with IgAN. In patients without antihypertensive treatment (n=18) positive correlations between PPI/24 h, PPI/a and serum uric acid level (r=0.59; r=0.48; p&lt;0.05 respectively) and between PPI/24, PPI/a and BMI-Z score (r=0.57; r=0.50; p&lt;0.05 respectively) were demonstrated. Disturbed circadian blood pressure profile was found in 13 (27.1%) patients; 11 patients with disturbed blood pressure profile did not have hypertension in ABPM. 6 patients had disturbed blood pressure profile despite antihypertensive treatment. Kidney function was normal in all patients.
OPN concentrations were higher in HD patients, whereas in PD patients comparable to those in the control group. There were no differences between PD and HD children. PDGF-BB median values were lower in both dialysis groups than in the controls, and the lowest of them were observed in HD patients. BMP-7 concentrations were increased in dialysis patients, comparing to the control group, and higher in HD patients than in the PD ones.
The median values of all MMPs and TIMPs were elevated in patients before HD vs. controls (p&lt;0.0001) and decreased after a single HD session (p&lt;0.01), yet remained higher than in the control group (p&lt;0.001). The MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio was decreased vs. controls both before and after a HD session (p&lt;0.0001). Contrarily, the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio before HD was higher than in controls (p&lt;0.05), but after HD dropped to the values lower than those in the control subjects (p&lt;0.01).
GSH and its fractions' concentrations were comparable to healthy subject, however in early relapse free fraction was significantly higher than in late remission. The albumin saturation with GSH was significantly higher in early than in late relapse. Total HCY concentration was decreased in early relapse, elevated after 2 week and comparable to controls after 8 week of treatment. HCY free fraction and albumin saturation were elevated within first 2 weeks. Children in long-term remission showed elevated total concentration of HCY and GSH and their protein bound fractions when compared to controls. Albumin saturation with these aminoacids was higher as well.
Increased resistin and adiponectin levels were observed during relapse and remission of INS, compared to controls. No significant difference between adipocytokines in relapse and remission INS was found. Serum resistin level decreased in remission of INS, compared to relapse, but the value did not reach statistical significance. Between resistin and cholesterol, resistin and proteinuria positive correlation was found. Negative correlation between resistin and serum albumin was observed.
Among children with ESRD, GD were diagnosed in 94 (48.2%)--mean age 10.9 +/- 4.3 years, congenital abnormalities of urinary tract in 61 (31.2%) aged 10.6 +/- 4.3 years and other causes in 40 (20.5%). Among 94 children with GD the 49 (52%) patients had primary glomerulonephritis (GN): 24--crescentic GN, 9--focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 8--mesangioproliferative GN, 5--IgA nephropathy, 3--membranoproliferative GN. In 37 (39.5%) the causes of ESRD were secondary glomerulopathies: 20--amyloidosis, 10--hemolytic-uremic syndrome, 6--Schönlein-Henoch nephropathy, 1--Wegener granulomatosis. In 8 (8.5%) patients causes of ESRD were: Alport syndrome in 2, congenital nephrotic syndrome in 1 and in 5 type of glomerulopathy was unknown. Time between diagnosis of nephropathy and start of dialysis was 0-13.75 years, median 1.1 in patients with GD and was significantly shorter (p&lt;0.003) than this time in the group with congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract (0-14.9 years; median 3.83). There was no difference between primary GN and secondary glomerulopathies.
Research has exerted, that over 3/5 respondents haven't been sufficiently prepared to work in dialysis station. About 30% of researched group didn't have enough knowledge to embrace patients entire care. The will of uplifting of professional qualifications have had 78% nurses. Respondents thought, that nursing group only partially (42%) should take independent operations. Only 50% nurses have conceded, that they have possibility to obtain the full information about health status of patients from doctors.
We showed that dialysis patients were generally satisfied with the level of care provided by nurses and described them as reliable, professional and well-qualified. Patients especially valued kind attitude, smile and friendliness of the nurses. Fully professional care was noticed by 25.7% of patients. Patients dialyzed for a longer period of time (over 10 years) described nurses' knowledge, practical skills and independence with more criticism. A quarter of them stated that nurses always relied on the doctor's decision.
In urine of children with NS (A) urinary concentration of LN significantly increased, in comparison to control (K) (p&lt;0.05), but FN was normal (p&gt;0.05). In children with remission of NS (B) urinary concentration of LN was unchanged (p&gt;0.05), but concentration of FN significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05). In renal biopsies majority children of A group presented minimal changes, but majority children of B group presented hyalinization of renal tubules.
There were found that sevelamer treatment significantly decrease the phosphates concentration and CaxP product in the serum without influence on concentration of PTH or calcium. Any adverse events were observed during the study and any drug intolerance.
56.2% of children with hydronephrosis had documented prenatal findings: 61%--pyelectasis, 15.3% renal cysts, 5.1% unspecified renal pathology, in 18.6% no renal pathology. 82.6% of newborns had term births but perinatal complications were observed in 30.5%. Initial postnatal diagnosis was performed by neonatal wards in 22.8% newborns and by the children's pediatrician in 31.4% of infants. Following referral to nephro-urology centre cystography was performed in 22.9% of infants and scintigraphy in 36.2%. 21.9% of infants were qualified for surgical intervention at an average age of 24 + 13 weeks.
The group of injury, poisoning and other consequences of external causes (S00-T98, ICD-10) was the third or fourth leading cause of death in the County population, both males and females. During the study period, the specific injury mortality rates showed no significant oscillations. In this group, male subjects and those aged 75 or older were found to predominate. Concerning external causes of mortality, we determined the circumstances in which fatal injuries were inflicted. Falls were the leading cause of injury and death in females aged 75 or older. Traffic accidents predominantly involved younger and older males, while deliberate self-harm was most common in middle-aged and old aged subjects, male in particular.
The patient mean age was 63.4 years +/- 13.1 (M +/- SD), and mean duration of diabetes 10.3 +/- 8.2 years (M +/- SD). The belief ininternal LOC was most common in study patients, followed by the belief in health dependence on circumstances, influence of chance, destiny or God, and finally influence of powerful others. Highly educated patients had a statistically significantly less expressed internal LOC and belief in the influence of chance, destiny or God. The patients that underestimated their quality of life, showed a statistically significantly lower rate of belief in health dependence on circumstances.
During one month, 1815 patients were referred, 979 for diagnostic procedures and 836 for specialist consultation (mean age 55.25 +/- 19.70; male 56.30 +/- 19.10, female 54.50 +/- 20.30). Most frequent diagnostic procedures requested were biochemical laboratory in primary health care setting (n = 331; 33.41%) and secondary care (n =1 18; 12.05%), basic radiology (n=106; 10.83%), ultrasonography (n=87; 8.80%) and microbiological laboratory (n = 68; 6.95%). The contribution of diagnostic procedures was mostly assessed as significant (54.84%). When GP and specialist indicated diagnostic procedure concordantly, its contribution was mostly assessed as significant (61.90%) and markedly significant (10.12%). Specialist consultations were used as follows: physical medicine in 131 (19%), surgeon in 90 (13%) and psychiatrist in 69 (10%) patients from inland area, cardiologist in 53 (37%), psychiatrist in 17 (12%) and oncologist in 12 (8%) patients from coastal area. Both in rural and urban practices in inland and coastal area surgeon consultations were assessed as markedly significant. Urban GPs assessed the contribution of first and follow-up check ups as undetermined or small more often than rural GPs (first check ups Xchi =21.66; P&lt;0.0001; follow-up check ups chi2 = 196.38; P &lt; 0.0001). Rural GPs assessed the contribution of first check ups more often as undetermined or small than significant (chi2 = 12.02; P = 0.0005), with the same tendency recorded for follow-up check ups (Xchi =32.01; P &lt; 0.0001).
Definitive diagnosis was made in 15 patients. Suspect findings were noted in 2 patients, whereas no diagnosis could be established in 13 patients. According to our experience, VCE is a promising new method that has a high diagnostic yield in patients with OGIB and known Crohn's disease. Use of VCE enabled definitive diagnosis to be made in 6 of 10 patients with OGIB after all previously used diagnostic methods had failed to reveal any pathological finding. In the group of OGIB patients, angiodysplasia was the most common findings (4 of 10 patients). In the group of patients with Crohn's disease, progression of the disease to neotherminal ileum was recorded in 3 of 5 patients. Our experience also confirmed the VCE to be a very safe method; capsule retention was recorded in only one patient.
The utilization of hypolipemics was 33.03 DDD/1000/day in 2001 and 72.38 DDD/1000/day in 2006, yielding an almost twofold rise. Two drugs, simvastatin and atorvastatin, predominated in the utilization of statins with 93%. From 2001 to 2006, the utilization of simvastatin showed a 30% increase and that of atorvastatin more than sevenfold increase. During the study period, the overall rate of hospitalization for cardiovascular disorders decreased by 18.5%.
The long axis of the left heart varied from 7 degrees to 54 degrees off the axial plane (mean 32 degrees +/- 7 degrees ). The required scan length to include the entire left ventricle and coronary arteries ranged from 8.2 to 12.4 cm (mean, 10.0 +/- 0.9 cm) for the axial scan plane and 5.6-10.1 cm (mean, 7.5 +/- 0.8 cm) for a scan plane parallel to the long axis of the heart (P &lt; .001). cCTA in the axial plane required a 7.4 +/- 1.6 cm overlap with the lower breast, whereas cCTA in the long axis of the heart reduced the overlap to 4.5 +/- 1.8 cm (P &lt; .001).
Images acquired using this system successfully demonstrated all three DEI contrast mechanisms. Flux measurements acquired using this 1-kW prototype system demonstrated that this design can be scaled to use a more powerful 60-kW x-ray tube to generate similar images with an image time of approximately 30 seconds. This single-crystal pair design can be further modified to allow for an array of crystals to reduce clinical image times to &lt;3 seconds.
Twenty-nine QA issues were identified in 28 women in 17 of 145 CT studies (11.7%) and 12 of 49 MR examinations (24.5%) in women having adnexal surgery (17 of 11,194 [0.15%] of female pelvic CT studies and 12 of 603 [2.0%] of female pelvic MR studies performed in the time interval). Issues included missed lesions, lesions misidentified as leiomyomas, fat described in the lesion but not seen histologically, postmenopausal status of patient not considered, ultrasound correlation not recommended, and confusion of right and left sides.
On non-contrast CT, fat containing HCC was either homogeneously hypodense (n = 6) or of mixed density (n = 1). The density values ranged between -11 and 9 HU. On MRI, homogenous (n = 4) or heterogeneous (n = 4) signal loss was observed on T1-weighted out-of-phase images as compared to in-phase images. Enhancement patterns on serial contrast-enhanced CT and MRI included: arterial enhancement indistinguishable from the liver with venous wash out (n = 2), arterial capillary blush with venous phase fading (n = 2), and heterogeneous arterial enhancement with unenhanced foci and venous phase wash out of enhancements. Larger lesions had late capsular enhancement.
For right sided great vessels, the 5th to 95th interval was 1.89-3.03 cm for ED PA diameter and 1.08-4.42 cm(2) for SVC cross-sectional area. The pulmonary artery to ascending aortic (PA-to-Ao) ratio was 0.66-1.13. In multivariate analysis, the PA was significantly associated with weight, whereas the PA-to-Ao ratio was inversely associated with age. Axial PA measurements were significantly higher and PA-to-Ao measurements significantly lower than corresponding short axis measurements (P = .04 and P &lt; .001, respectively).
The sensitivity of GGO for 3 radiologists (60%-80%) was significantly higher than that for the CAD system (21%) (McNemar's test, P &lt; .0001). For overall and solid nodules, the figure-of-merit values without and with the CAD system were significantly different (P = .005-.04) on jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic analysis. For GGO and part-solid nodules, the figure-of-merit values with the CAD system were greater than those without the CAD system, indicating no significant differences.
Using IVUS as a gold standard, imaging using an intravascular antenna leads to an increase in geometrical accuracy in comparison to traditional surface MRI. This level of accuracy appears to follow a significant inverse proportionality relation in respect to vessel wall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Taking into account the rapid decrease in SNR as a function of the distance to the intravascular antenna, these results imply that, for a given level of geometrical accuracy, faster sequences can be used for the imaging of smaller vessels.
The results indicated that accommodation at near distances was significantly worse overall compared to far distances and was significantly worse after a day of digital reading at all distances.
The relative percentage errors showed that there was substantial underestimation of nodule volumes at 30, 60, and 90 mA and substantial overestimation of volumes at 120, 150, 180, and 210 mA, but there was no statistically significant difference in absolute percentage errors (P = .876). Pearson's correlation coefficient of the mean absolute percentage errors of nodules on volumetric measurement versus the mean attenuation value of nodules showed a negative correlation, and the ratio of solid component to whole nodule versus the mean attenuation of nodules showed a positive correlation.
The ED was kept similar for the four different tube voltages: (A) 5.4 mSv +/- 0.3, (B) 4.1 mSv +/- 0.6, (C) 3.9 mSv +/- 0.5, and (D) 4.2 mSv +/- 0.3 (P &gt; .05). As the tube voltage decreased from 140 to 80 kVp, image noise was maintained (range, 13.8-14.9 HU) (P &gt; .05). SNR increased as the tube voltage decreased, with an overall gain of 119% for the 80-kVp compared to the 140-kVp protocol (P &lt; .05). The FOM results indicated that with a reduction of the tube voltage from 140 to 120, 100, and 80 kVp, at constant SNR, ED was reduced by a factor of 2.1, 3.3, and 5.1, respectively, (P &lt; .001).
Four-component segregation was obtained in 5 of 23 combinations. The best result showed a mean of 87% across the four components. For each component, there were 20 of 23 for FW, 22 for OL, 9 for 2A, and 16 for 4A.
Of the 12 tumors assessed, a total of 17 enhanced SLNs were detected by CEUS. Among them, a single SLN was detected in eight tumors, two SLNs in three tumors, and three SLNs in one tumor. All the SLNs showed partial enhancement on CEUS. Nineteen SLNs were identified by blue dye with surgical dissection. There were no false-positive CEUS findings in terms of SLN detection. The overall sensitivity of CEUS for detecting SLNs was 89.5% (17/19). Among the 17 SLNs detected by CEUS, tumor metastases were identified histopathologically in 4 SLNs, whereas proliferation of lymphatic tissue was identified in the other 13 SLNs.
The estimated mean areas under the LROC curves were 0.665 +/- 0.071 for large-size images and 0.669 +/- 0.087 for small-size images. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (P = .823). The viewing time of small-size images (1201.4 seconds) was significantly shorter than that of large-size images (1719.7 seconds). A statistically significant difference was also found in viewing times between reduced and nonreduced digital images with Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (P &lt; .05).
Response rate for the study was 36% (62 of 172 chair), who together supervised 1726 (37.9%) of current radiology residents. Eighty-seven percent of respondents allowed internal or external moonlighting. Sixty percent allowed internal moonlighting, predominantly permitting senior residents this privilege. Fifty-eight percent acknowledged external moonlighting: 13.7% of residents and 24.6% of fellows. Of the programs who allowed residents, 20% allowed second years, 68.6% third years, 85.7% fourth years, and 65.7% fellows. Forty-three percent of programs accounted for hours worked externally and only three programs accounted for travel time.
Diffraction-enhanced images of the cadaveric tali allowed the visualization of cartilage and its specific level of degeneration for each specimen. There was a significant correlation between the grade of cartilage integrity as assessed on the tube diffraction-enhanced images and on their respective histologic sections (r = 0.97, P = .01). Images of the intact knee showed the articular cartilage edge of the femoral condyle, even when superimposed by the tibia. In the thumb image, it was possible to visualize articular cartilage, tendons, and other soft tissues.
Focus groups indicated that caregivers expressed dissatisfaction with current AD treatment routines including limitations related to: efficacy, administration schedule, number of pills, adherence to treatment, side effects, and taking pills. In-depth interviews with caregivers found the ADCPQ to be comprehensible with an acceptable layout. The resultant ADCPQ comprises three modules: A) baseline, 11 items assessing treatment expectations; B) week 8, 33 items on satisfaction and preferences with treatment options; C) week 24, 10 items assessing overall opinions of treatment options. Missing data per item was low (&lt;or=0.3%) and domain internal consistency reliability was good (0.71-0.91). Preference items were also valid when evaluating concordance and discordance between convenience and satisfaction patch and capsule domain scores.
There was a statistically significant increase in Schirmer (with anesthesia) scores of 2.7+/-2.2 mm after 3 months of treatment in the topical cyclosporine group (P&lt;0.001), compared with a mean decrease of -1.4+/-4.6 mm (P=0.271) in the artificial tears group. The mean tear break-up time score significantly improved in the topical cyclosporine group (mean increase of 3.56+/-1.5 seconds, P&lt;0.001), but worsened in the control group, although this change was not significantly significant (mean decrease of -0.04+/-1.6 seconds, P=0.929). The topical cyclosporine group exhibited a significantly greater mean reduction in corneal staining scores (-1.3+/-0.53) compared with the control group (-0.2+/-0.83; between groups P&lt;0.001). The topical cyclosporine group had a greater improvement in Ocular Surface Disease Index scores than those using artificial tears (P=0.022). Limitations of the study included an older, predominantly Caucasian patient population and short trial length.
The ultrasonographic observations of the location of the puborectalis were confirmed by anatomy for the fresh cadaver. Bilateral, symmetrical, hypoechoic strips were observed beside the prostate in cross-section, and strip fibers were observed in the longitudinal section. The right and left puborectalis thickness measurements were 6.1 and 6.2 mm, respectively, in the sonographic image, and the measurements were 5.85 and 5.89 mm, respectively, in the formalin-fixed fresh cadaver.
A total of 61 patients received ketorolac 0.4% (n=30) or bromfenac 0.09% (n=31). The mean (+/-SD) aqueous PGE(2) level was 285.6+/-141.9 pg/mL in patients treated with ketorolac 0.4% and 386.2+/-131.0 pg/mL in patients treated with bromfenac 0.09% (P=0.006). The mean (+/-SD) aqueous concentrations of ketorolac and bromfenac were 83.6+/-73.8 ng/mL and 9.2+/-6.6 ng/mL, respectively (P&lt;0.001).
The increment rate of postprandial plasma glucose ([plasma glucose 2 hours after test meal - fasting glucose]/fasting glucose) decreased from 34.7%+/-23.9% to 25.0%+/-24.6% (P=0.13) in the low-dose group, and decreased significantly from 56.1%+/-53.1% to 31.5%+/-36.0% (P=0.03) in the high-dose group after changeover. However, there were no significant changes in blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels before and after changeover in either group. The increment rate of postprandial serum triglyceride (TG) ([serum TG 2 hours after test meal - fasting TG]/fasting TG) decreased significantly only in the high-dose group (52.4%+/-60.0% to 24.3%+/-16.6%) (P=0.05). No significant changes in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in either group, whereas serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly from 3.20+/-0.25 to 2.65+/-0.18 mmol/L (P=0.04), only in the high-dose group.
Patients with HIV infection are at an increased risk of psychiatric illness. Major depressive disorder and subsyndromal depressive symptoms, as well as anxiety disorder and substance abuse are more prevalent among HIV infected individuals than among the general population. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are common among HIV patients, and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a serious condition during the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage of HIV disease. Secondary mania and psychosis might be the first clinical symptom of HIV dementia. The introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in significant decreases in morbidity and mortality for HIV infected patients. HAART has also decreased the incidence of HAD, but does not give complete protection from this condition. The utility of psychotropic medications in HIV patients has not been studied sufficiently as a basis for guidelines, and more controlled trials are needed.
Of the 12 patients recruited, prominent results were: male to female ratio of 1:1; all had insidious onset of psychosis; a third had all 3 multidimensional impairment (MDI) symptoms; all patients that received ADHD treatment had ADHD treatment failure; two thirds had milestone delay; 58% had birth complications; a third were predominantly bottle fed; 42% had family history of schizophrenia; a third had family history of other major psychiatric conditions; all patients had at least one non-psychotic deviant behaviour (NPDB); no patient used cannabis; all delusions were paranoid; 92% had school achievement difficulty and a third had treatment resistance. Gender comparison included: earlier onset of psychosis in females; all females had aggression versus a third of males; more females had school achievement difficulty than males; males had more treatment resistance. Patients with MDI, compared to the sample average had: earlier onset of non-psychotic deviant behaviour; lower school drop-out rate; less social difficulty and no treatment resistance.
The world view has a significant influence on perception of psychotic illness.
The search yielded 143 references, between 1958 and 2004, from articles, case reports, scientific letter, theses and chapters in books. A cross section of 56 references was selected for inclusion in this review of the material.
Individual and pooled results of the 3 trials showed that candesartan had little effect on risk for microalbuminuria (pooled hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.16]; P = 0.60). Pooled results showed that the annual rate of change in albuminuria was 5.53% lower (CI, 0.73% to 10.14%; P = 0.024) with candesartan than with placebo.
No important difference was found in the composite renal outcome with telmisartan (58 patients [1.96%]) versus placebo (46 patients [1.55%]) (hazard ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.89]; P = 0.20). Among the telmisartan and placebo groups, 7 and 10 patients had dialysis and 56 and 36 patients had doubling of serum creatinine, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.59 [CI, 1.04 to 2.41]; P = 0.031). Albuminuria increased less with telmisartan than with placebo (32% [CI, 23% to 41%] vs. 63% [CI, 52% to 76%]; P &lt; 0.001). Decreases in estimated GFR were greater with telmisartan than with placebo (mean change in estimated GFR, -3.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) [SD, 18.3] vs. -0.26 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) [SD, 18.0]; P &lt; 0.001).
Computed tomography scans of 4112 patients were reviewed and 440 (11%) aortic dilations were identified, of which 91 were new findings. Radiologists directly notified clinical teams about 5 (5%) new dilations. Clinical teams did not record in the EMR recognition of 53 of 91 (58%) dilations within 3 months of the CT, and 9% of these dilations were 5.5 cm or larger. The median time to recognition of aneurysm in the EMR was 237 days, and no EMR documentation existed for 16 abnormalities (29% of surviving patients) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. No evidence indicated that any of the aneurysms ruptured or that patient deaths resulted from the delayed follow-up.
More than one half of the physicians (53.1%) reported time pressure during office visits, 48.1% said their work pace was chaotic, 78.4% noted low control over their work, and 26.5% reported burnout. Adverse workflow (time pressure and chaotic environments), low work control, and unfavorable organizational culture were strongly associated with low physician satisfaction, high stress, burnout, and intent to leave. Some work conditions were associated with lower quality and more errors, but findings were inconsistent across work conditions and diagnoses. No association was found between adverse physician reactions, such as stress and burnout, and care quality or errors.
Direct evidence on screening and evidence on accuracy of diagnostic tests were synthesized qualitatively. For benefits and harms of treatments, quantitative estimates for treatment effects from good-quality systematic reviews were reported or relative risks using a random-effects model were calculated. Direct evidence shows that screening for vision impairment in older adults in primary care settings is not associated with improved visual or other clinical outcomes and may be associated with unintended harms, such as increased falls. Effective treatments are available for uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD. A visual acuity test (for example, the Snellen eye chart) is the standard for screening for vision impairment in primary care, but its diagnostic accuracy is uncertain because no studies compare it against a clinically relevant reference standard. There remains no evidence on accuracy of funduscopic examination.
Intention-to-treat analyses showed that scores on the Insomnia Severity Index significantly improved from 15.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.07 to 17.39) to 6.59 (95% CI, 4.73 to 8.45) for the Internet group but did not change for the control group (16.27 [95% CI, 14.61 to 17.94] to 15.50 [95% CI, 13.64 to 17.36]) (F(1,42) = 29.64; P &lt; .001). The Internet group maintained their gains at the 6-month follow-up. Internet participants also achieved significant decreases in wake after sleep onset (55% [95% CI, 34% to 76%]) and increases in sleep efficiency (16% [95% CI, 9% to 22%]) compared with the nonsignificant control group changes of wake after sleep onset (8% [95% CI, -17% to 33%) and sleep efficiency (3%; 95% CI, -4% to 9%).
The 3-group, cross-validated classification accuracies of the first analysis were 86% (HCs vs the rest), 91% (early at-risk individuals vs the rest), and 86% (late at-risk individuals vs the rest). The accuracies in the second analysis were 90% (HCs vs the rest), 88% (individuals with transition vs the rest), and 86% (individuals without transition vs the rest). Independent HCs were correctly classified in 96% (first analysis) and 93% (second analysis) of cases.
The incidence rate ratio of heart disease contacts in persons with severe mental disorder compared with the rate for the nonpsychiatric general population was only slightly increased, at 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.14). In contrast, their excess mortality rate ratio from heart disease was 2.90 (95% confidence interval, 2.71-3.10). Five years after the first contact for somatic heart disease, the risk of dying of heart disease was 8.26% for persons with severe mental disorder (aged &lt;70 years) but only 2.86% in patients with heart disease who had never been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. The fraction undergoing invasive procedures within 5 years was reduced among patients with severe mental disorder as compared with the nonpsychiatric general population (7.04% vs 12.27%, respectively).
Variation in GM volume was associated with GSK3beta polymorphisms; the most significant associations were found for rs6438552, a putative functional intronic SNP that showed 3 significant GM clusters in the right and left superior temporal gyri and the right hippocampus (P &lt; .001, P = .02, and P = .02, respectively, corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain). Similar results were obtained with rs12630592, an SNP in high linkage disequilibrium. A significant SNP x MDD status interaction was observed for the effect on GM volumes in the right hippocampus and superior temporal gyri (P &lt; .001 and P = .01, corrected, respectively).
Treatment with nortriptyline enhanced the efficacy and reduced the cognitive adverse effects of ECT relative to placebo. Venlafaxine resulted in a weaker degree of improvement and tended to worsen cognitive adverse effects. High-dosage right unilateral ECT did not differ or was superior to bilateral ECT in efficacy and resulted in less severe amnesia.
Family history was associated with the presence of all 4 disorder types. In addition, family history was associated with a more recurrent course for all 4 disorders (but not significantly for women with depression), worse impairment, and greater service use. Family history was not associated with younger age at onset for any disorder.
The FDRs of probands with schizophrenia showed significantly (P = .01) increased rates of BD relative to control FDRs (odds ratio [OR] = 2.08). The FDRs of probands with BD showed marginally (P = .06) increased rates of schizophrenia relative to control FDRs (OR = 2.10); this analysis was significant (P = .02) when studies that did not report morbid risk estimates were excluded (in this case, OR = 3.49).
Patients assigned to receive N-acetylcysteine had significantly greater reductions in hair-pulling symptoms as measured using the Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale (P &lt; .001) and the Psychiatric Institute Trichotillomania Scale (P = .001). Fifty-six percent of patients "much or very much improved" with N-acetylcysteine use compared with 16% taking placebo (P = .003). Significant improvement was initially noted after 9 weeks of treatment.
Adolescent depression significantly predicted young adult depression in the bivariate analysis, but this effect was entirely accounted for by comorbidity of adolescent depression with adolescent oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, and substance disorders in adjusted analyses. Generalized anxiety and depression cross-predicted each other, and oppositional defiant disorder (but not conduct disorder) predicted later anxiety disorders and depression. Evidence of homotypic prediction was supported for substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder (from conduct disorder), and anxiety disorders, although this effect was primarily accounted for by DSM-III-R overanxious disorder.
The GWAS produced 121 SNPs with nominal P &lt; 10(-4). These, together with 19 additional SNPs from homologues of rat genes showing differential expression, were genotyped in the follow-up sample. Fifteen SNPs showed significant association with the same allele as in the GWAS. In the combined analysis, 2 closely linked intergenic SNPs met genome-wide significance (rs7590720, P = 9.72 x 10(-9); rs1344694, P = 1.69 x 10(-8)). They are located on chromosome region 2q35, which has been implicated in linkage studies for alcohol phenotypes. Nine SNPs were located in genes, including the CDH13 and ADH1C genes, that have been reported to be associated with alcohol dependence.
In all cohorts and countries, women had more anxiety and mood disorders than men, and men had more externalizing and substance disorders than women. Although gender differences were generally consistent across cohorts, significant narrowing was found in recent cohorts for major depressive disorder and substance disorders. This narrowing was significantly related to temporal (major depressive disorder) and spatial (substance disorders) variation in gender role traditionality.
Ninety-four children (mean [SD] age, 15.0 [2.7] months at randomization) with at least 1 follow-up examination were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 10.5 (2.2) months. Fifteen of 29 of the children in the control group (51.7%) had tooth decay compared with 13 of 32 children in the Xyl-3x group (40.6%) and eight of 33 children in the Xyl-2x group (24.2%). The mean (SD) numbers of decayed teeth were 1.9 (2.4) in the control group, 1.0 (1.4) in the Xyl-3x group, and 0.6 (1.1) in the Xyl-2x group. Compared with the control group, there were significantly fewer decayed teeth in the Xyl-2x group (relative risk, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.66; P = .003) and in the Xyl-3x group (0.50; 0.26-0.96; P = .04). No statistical difference was noted between the 2 xylitol treatment groups (P = .22).
A total of 512 768 infants were included, of whom 2.3% had CCCs at newborn discharge. Infants with CCCs accounted for 37.8% of deaths and 11.0% of hospitalizations during the first year after the newborn discharge. Infants with CCCs living in the lowest-income neighborhoods had a 1.26-fold higher mortality risk (95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.90; P = .28) and a 1.24-fold higher hospitalization rate (1.09-1.40; P &lt; .001) compared with those living in the highest-income neighborhoods. Although the income gradients associated with mortality and hospitalization were less pronounced among infants with CCCs compared with infants without CCCs, the absolute interquintile risk differences attributable to SES were higher among infants with CCCs.
Birth asphyxia occurred in 78 of 1000 live births, and asphyxia-specific mortality was 11 per 1000 live births. After controlling for confounding factors, mothers with height shorter than 145 cm were more likely to have an infant with birth asphyxia compared with mothers 145 cm or taller (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.0). Mothers with mid-upper arm circumference smaller than 21.5 cm carried a higher risk of delivering an infant with birth asphyxia compared with those with arm circumference greater than 23 cm (adjusted RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1- 2.0). Asphyxia was more common among newborns with head circumference greater than 33.5 cm than those with head circumferences 32.6 to 33.5 cm (adjusted RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Birth weight was not independently associated with birth asphyxia; however, there was significant interaction between maternal stature and birth weight (P = .01); a 3300-g infant born to a mother shorter than 145 cm carried a 3.8 times higher asphyxia risk (95% CI, 2.2-6.5) than an infant of median weight (2620 g) born to a mother taller than 145 cm.
At baseline, students in the intervention condition were slightly to moderately more likely to report use for each of the 8 measures examined than were students in the control condition. For all measures except lifetime use of cigarettes, these differences were less pronounced at follow-up and therefore were in the direction of favorable program effects. These changes were statistically significant, however, for only 1 outcome measure, past 30-day use of alcohol (reduction in the adjusted odds ratio from 2.07 at baseline to 1.32 at follow-up; P = .006).
Children who played the healthier version of the advergame selected and ate significantly more healthy snacks than did those who played the less healthy version. Children reported liking the advergame.
At follow-up, 353 respondents (17.2%) were established smokers. Exposure to the highest quartile of movie smoking compared with the lowest increased the likelihood of established smoking (odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.57), and team sports nonparticipants compared with participants were twice as likely to be established smokers (odds ratio = 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-2.74). The joint effects of movie smoking exposure and team sports participation revealed that at each quartile of movie smoking exposure, the odds of established smoking were greater for team sports nonparticipants than for participants. We saw a dose-response relationship of movie smoking exposure for established smoking only among team sports participants.
Recent or chronic depression in adulthood was more common for blacks (women, 19.3%; men, 11.9%) than for whites (women, 13.0%; men, 8.1%). Among all groups (white men and women, and black men and women), adult depression was associated with multiple partners but not with condom use. Among black men, depression was strongly associated with STI (recent: adjusted prevalence ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-4.43; chronic: adjusted prevalence ratio, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-6.28); having multiple partners did not mediate associations between depression and STI.
While all participants identified common elements in their definition of hope, parents identified their role as bearers of hope; it was a cornerstone of decision making. Health care professionals tended to view hope as related to a positive outcome. Some physicians reported difficulty in maintaining hope in the face of prognostic data; others acknowledged the importance of the family's hope. Nurses identified particular challenges around parents' decisions to continue treatment when it prolonged the child's suffering. All participants noted the changing nature of hope and its implications for care.
During our study period 13 691 ARPs, 41 441 nonincidental appendectomies, 14 895 pyloromyotomies, and 23 527 gastrostomy tube placements were identified. The average number of ARPs per appendectomy, pyloromyotomy, and gastrostomy tube placement declined annually across free-standing pediatric institutions. When these annual changes are examined within each hospital individually, however, it appears that such changes are not occurring equally, in that some hospitals are performing significantly greater and some significantly fewer ARPs relative to these common procedures.
Key themes that emerged from a thematic analysis of the literature that GP educators need to consider when teaching registrars about research were [i] the need to understand that learning research is influenced by attitudes; [ii] the need to address organisational constraints on learning research; [iii] the need to identify the educational barriers on learning research; [iv] the need to understand there are gaps in GP research content - especially from GP registrars; And [v] the need to understand the value of research on the GP registrar's educational cycle of learning, which develops in a culture that allows research to flourish.

Duplex RNA were designed to have incomplete complementarity with the 3'UTR sequences of both target genes. One such duplex, CODEMIR-1, was found to suppress VEGF and ICAM-1 by 90 and 60%, respectively in ARPE-19 cells at a transfected concentration of 40 ng/mL. Use of a cyan fusion reporter with target sites constructed in its 3'UTR demonstrated that the repression of VEGF and ICAM-1 by CODEMIR-1 was indeed due to interaction with the target sequence. An exhaustive analysis of sequence variants of CODEMIR-1 demonstrated a clear positive correlation between activity against VEGF (but not ICAM-1) and the length of the contiguous complementary region (from the 5' end of the guide strand). Various strategies, including the use of inosine bases at the sites of divergence of the target sequences were investigated.
The minor allele for one synonymous SNP in NFKBIA, rs1957106, was associated with decreased risk (p = 0.03).
In summary, we identified several MMPs (MMP-1, -2, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, -13, -15, -19, -23, -24, -27 and -28) with a stronger expression in breast cancer tissue compared to normal breast tissue. Of those, expression of MMP-8, -10, -12 and -27 is related to tumor grade since it is higher in analyzed G3 compared to G2 tissue samples. In contrast, MMP-7 and MMP-27 mRNA showed a weaker expression in tumor samples compared to healthy tissue. In addition, we demonstrated that the four breast cancer cell lines examined, are constitutively expressing a wide variety of MMPs. Of those, MDA-MB-468 showed the strongest mRNA and protein expression for most of the MMPs analyzed.
In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, tumor subgroup (TNBC vs. non-TNBC) was a prognosis factor related to 5-year overall survival. In the univariate analysis, tumor subgroup (TNBC vs. non-TNBC) was a significant factor related to 5-year overall survival, in addition to age, tumor size, lymph node, metastasis, grade, stage, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, and HER2 overexpression status. In the multivariate analysis, tumor subgroup was not a significant factor related to 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). In node-positive patients, tumor subgroup was a significant factor related to 5-year overall survival, in addition to age, tumor size, metastasis, and grade. In node-negative patients, tumor subgroup was not a significant factor related to 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival.
Physical functioning domain mean score was far below average (33.53 +/- 29.65). Role physical and role emotional domains were a little above average (54.7 +/- 40.4, 51.1 +/- 40.6 respectively). Role Physical (p = 0.043), Role Emotional (p = 0.003), Vitality (p = 0.014) and Mental Health (p = 0.034) domain mean scores for patients with controlled BP were significantly higher than patients with uncontrolled BP. The overall HRQOL was significantly better in the group of hypertensives with controlled blood pressure (p = 0.014). Increasing blood pressure (p = 0.005) and symptom count (p &lt; 0.001), the presence of stroke (p = 0.008) and visual impairment (p = 0.015) were significant negative predictors of the overall HRQOL.
We found that calpain was activated in all the plaques and calpain activity colocalized with apoptotic cell death. Our observation of autoproteolytic cleavage of the 80 kDa subunit of calpain-1 provided further evidence for enzyme activity in the plaque samples. When calpain activity was quantified, we found that plaques from symptomatic patients displayed significantly lower calpain activity compared with asymptomatic plaques.
Three unrelated infants showed a mitochondrial mosaic in the liver after staining for COX activity, i.e. hepatocytes with strongly reactive mitochondria were found adjacent to cells with many negative, or barely reactive, mitochondria. Deficiency was most severe in the patient diagnosed with Pearson syndrome. Ragged-red fibers were absent in muscle biopsies of all patients. Enzyme biochemistry was not diagnostic in muscle, fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Blue native gel electrophoresis of liver tissue, but not of muscle, demonstrated a decreased activity of complex IV; in both muscle and liver subcomplexes of complex V were seen. Immunocytochemistry of complex IV confirmed the mosaic pattern in two livers, but not in fibroblasts. MRI of the brain revealed severe white matter cavitation in the Pearson case, but only slight cortical atrophy in the Alpers-Huttenlocher patient, and a normal image in the 3rd. MtDNA in leucocytes showed a common deletion in 50% of the mtDNA molecules of the Pearson patient. In the patient diagnosed with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, mtDNA was depleted for 60% in muscle. In the 3rd patient muscular and hepatic mtDNA was depleted for more than 70%. Mutations in the nuclear encoded gene of POLG were subsequently found in both the 2nd and 3rd patients.
We established the transgenic Xenopus laevis strain tom3 that expresses ubiquitously red fluorescence from the tdTomato gene through all larval stages and in the adult animal. This new tool was applied to track transplanted blastemas obtained after tail amputation. The blastema can regenerate ectopic tails marked by red fluorescence in the host animal. Surprisingly, we also found contribution of the host animal to form the regenerate.
The Alsophila cp genome is 156,661 base pairs (bp) in size, and has a typical quadripartite structure with the large (LSC, 86,308 bp) and small single copy (SSC, 21,623 bp) regions separated by two copies of an inverted repeat (IRs, 24,365 bp each). This genome contains 117 different genes encoding 85 proteins, 4 rRNAs and 28 tRNAs. Pseudogenes of ycf66 and trnT-UGU are also detected in this genome. A unique trnR-UCG gene (derived from trnR-CCG) is found between rbcL and accD. The Alsophila cp genome shares some unusual characteristics with the previously sequenced cp genome of the polypod fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, including the absence of 5 tRNA genes that exist in most other cp genomes. The genome shows a high degree of synteny with that of Adiantum, but differs considerably from two basal ferns (Angiopteris evecta and Psilotum nudum). At one endpoint of an ancient inversion we detected a highly repeated 565-bp-region that is absent from the Adiantum cp genome. An additional minor inversion of the trnD-GUC, which is possibly shared by all ferns, was identified by comparison between the fern and other land plant cp genomes.
Contrary to previous studies, Old World toads were recovered as a nested clade within New World Bufonidae, indicating a single colonization event. Species currently classified as Ansonia and Pedostibes were both recovered as being non-monophyletic, providing evidence for the independent origin of torrential and arboreal ecomorphs on the Indian subcontinent and in South-East Asia. Our analyses also revealed a previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads containing a variety of larval and adult ecomorphs. Molecular dating estimates and biogeographic analyses indicate that the early diversification of this clade happened in the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene.
Our data highlighted that GPs currently followed up only a minority of SMD patients on a continuous basis and far fewer for both physical and mental health problems. A linear regression model that accounts for 43% of the variance was generated. The best variables associated positively with GPs taking on SMD patients were: frequency of referrals for joint follow-up with other resources, and involvement in post-hospitalization follow-up. Conversely, lack of expertise in mental health (related in our model to frequency of mental disorder patient transfer due to insufficient mental health training) is associated with a lower incidence of GPs taking on patients.
Here, we generate gene expression profiles of 42 normal human tissues on custom high-density microarrays to systematically identify 1,522 HKGs and 975 TEGs and compile a small subset of 20 housekeeping genes which are highly expressed in all tissues with lower variance than many commonly used HKGs. Cross-species comparison shows that both the functions and expression patterns of HKGs are conserved. TEGs are enriched with respect to both segmental duplication and copy number variation, while no such enrichment is observed for HKGs, suggesting the high expression of HKGs are not due to high copy numbers. Analysis of genomic and epigenetic features of HKGs and TEGs reveals that the high expression of HKGs across different tissues is associated with decreased nucleosome occupancy at the transcription start site as indicated by enhanced DNase hypersensitivity. Additionally, we systematically and quantitatively demonstrated that the CpG islands' enrichment in HKGs transcription start sites (TSS) and their depletion in TEGs TSS. Histone methylation patterns differ significantly between HKGs and TEGs, suggesting that methylation contributes to the differential expression patterns as well.
Of 302 completed questionnaire replies, 4.4% stated that mandatory vaccination should be abandoned now, 21.2% that it should be phased out, and 74.4% that it should be retained.
The model validation shows that four critical model outputs (average duration of symptom onset to treatment, detection rate, cure rate, and death rate) were reasonably close to existing available data, erring towards more optimistic outcomes than are actually reported. The model predicted that an intervention to reduce the proportion of tuberculosis patients who never seek care would have the biggest impact on tuberculosis death prevention, while an intervention resulting in more referrals of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS facilities would yield higher cure rates. This finding is similar for situations where the alternative sector is a more important health resource, such as in most other parts of Indonesia.
There was no discernable variation in the frequencies of the three INSIG2 SNP genotypes observed between white, Hispanic, and African-American obese individuals and non-obese study subjects. When the relationship between rs7566605 and BMI considered either as a categorical variable or a continuous variable was examined, no significant association with obesity was found for participants in any of the four study populations or in a combined analysis (p = 0.38) under a recessive genetic model. There was also no association between the INSIG2 polymorphism and the obesity-related quantitative traits except for a reduced waist-to-hip ratio in white ARIC study participants homozygous for the C allele, and an increased waist-to-hip ratio in African-Americans in the ARIC cohort with the same genotype (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively). An association with waist-to-hip ratio was not seen when the combined study sample was analyzed (p = 0.74).
We found that a gene set linked to GF signaling was significantly enriched in the luminal-B tumors, despite only 10% of samples over-expressing HER2 by immunohistochemistry. To determine the biological significance of this observation, MCF-7 cells were treated with HRG. These cells displayed phosphorylation of HER2/3 and downstream ERK and S6. Treatment with HRG overcame tamoxifen-induced cell cycle arrest with higher S-phase fraction and increased anchorage independent colony formation. Gene expression profiles of MCF-7 cells treated with HRG confirmed enrichment of the GF signaling gene set and a similar proliferative signature observed in human ER+ BCs resistant to tamoxifen.
Using a combination of in silico and in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that the SHBG gene, along with exon 1 and alternative exon 1 (renamed here exon 1A), contains four additional alternative first exons: the novel exons 1B, 1C, and 1E, and a previously identified exon 1N, which has been further characterized and renamed as exon 1D. We have shown that these four alternative first exons are all spliced to the same 3' splice site of SHBG exon 2, and that exon 1A and the novel exon 1B can be spliced to exon 1. We have also demonstrated the presence of SHBG transcripts beginning with exons 1B, 1C and 1D in prostate tissues and cell lines, as well as in several non-prostatic cell lines. Finally, the alignment of the SHBG mammalian sequences revealed that, while exons 1C, 1D and 1E are very well conserved phylogenetically through non-primate mammal species, exon 1B probably aroused in apes due to a single nucleotide change that generated a new 5' splice site in exon 1B.
From the phone-interview screening, we divided participants (n = 768) in three groups: No Pain (NP) (n = 185); Regional Pain (RP) (n = 388) and Widespread Pain (WP) (n = 106). Among those participating in the clinical assessments, (304 subjects), the prevalence of fibromyalgia was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [2.6%; 6.3%]). Symptoms of pain (VAS and FIQ), feeling well, job ability, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety and depression were statically different among the groups. In multivariate analyses we found that individuals with FM and WP had significantly higher impairment than those with RP and NP. FM and WP were similarly disabling. Similarly, RP was no significantly different than NP.
Fifty-seven participants who were in work returned the postal survey. Of the original 55 items 38 were shown to fit the Rasch model (chi(2) 37.5; df 38; p 0.494) and free of bias for gender and disease duration. Following analysis for discrimination against the gold standard assessments 20 items remained with good fit to the model (chi(2) 24.8; df 20; p 0.21). Test-retest reliability was 0.94.
We found that overexpression of HaDREB2 in seeds did not enhance longevity. This was deduced from assays of basal thermotolerance and controlled seed-deterioration, which were performed with transgenic tobacco. Furthermore, the constitutive overexpression of HaDREB2 did not increase thermotolerance in seedlings or result in the accumulation of HSPs at normal growth temperatures. In contrast, when HaDREB2 and HaHSFA9 were conjointly overexpressed in seeds, we observed positive effects on seed longevity, beyond those observed with overexpression of HaHSFA9 alone. Such additional effects are accompanied by a subtle enhancement of the accumulation of subsets of sHSPs belonging to the CI and CII cytosolic classes.
InfoKeep scores were significantly different across the classifications (p &lt; or = 0.01) due to low scores for Wigglesworth and Aberdeen. CODAC received the highest mean (SD) score of 3.40 (0.73) followed by PSANZ-PDC, ReCoDe and Tulip [2.77 (1.00), 2.36 (1.21), 1.92 (1.24) respectively]. Wigglesworth and Aberdeen resulted in a high proportion of unexplained stillbirths and CODAC and Tulip the lowest. While Ease scores were different (p &lt; or = 0.01), all systems received satisfactory scores; CODAC received the highest score. Aberdeen and Wigglesworth showed poor agreement with kappas of 0.35 and 0.25 respectively. Tulip performed best with a kappa of 0.74. The remainder had good to fair agreement.
The method is demonstrated through retrospective analyses of two data sets: description of the patients referred to the hospital by their general practitioners (GPs) participating in the French Sentinel Network and description of patients directly consulting at a hospital emergency department (HED).Informative image color-change alert patterns emerged in both cases: the health consequences of the August 2003 heat wave were visualized with GPs' data (but passed unnoticed with conventional surveillance systems), and the flu epidemics, which are routinely detected by standard statistical techniques, were recognized visually with HED data.
Greater discussion of scientific evidence within testimony given was associated with the passage of workplace smoking legislation that provided greater protection for public health, regardless of whether supporters outnumbered opponents or vice versa.
The percentage of adolescents who ever had sexual intercourse or had sexual intercourse in last three months was 7.2% and 4.3% in adolescents of migrant workers, respectively; in contrast, 4.5% and 1.8% in their peers of general residents, respectively. 47.3% adolescents of migrant workers and 34.3% of those adolescents of general residents reported no condom use in sexual intercourse during last three months. Multivariate logistic regression analyses found that migration was a independent risk factor for sexual intercourse in last three months in our sampled adolescents (odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.72). In adolescents of migrant workers, factors such as lower family income (OR: 2.22, CI: 1.09-3.05 for low level; OR:1.25, CI: 1.04-1.59 for medium level), younger age at first sexual intercourse (OR: 1.24, CI: 1.09-1.57), lower knowledge on HIV/AIDS (OR: 0.93, CI: 0.90-0.97), and fewer communication on HIV/AIDS related issues (OR: 0.79, CI: 0.90-0.97) were related to sexual intercourse in last three months.
Adult cotton rats had significantly greater tidal volume (TV), and lower resistance and elastance than young animals. To evaluate the impact of this increased lung capacity and stiffening on respiratory disease, young and adult animals were infected intra-nasally with influenza A/Wuhan/359/95. Both age groups had increased respiratory rate and enhanced pause (Penh) during infection, suggesting lower airway obstruction. However, in spite of significant tachypnea, the infant (unlike the adult) cotton rats maintained the same tidal volume, resulting in an increased minute volume. In addition, the parameters that contribute to Penh were different: while relaxation time between breaths and time of expiration was decreased in both age groups, a disproportionate increase in peak inspiratory and expiratory flow contributed to the increase in Penh in infant animals.
The synergy factor (SF) allows assessment of binary interactions in case-control studies. In this paper we describe its properties and its novel characteristics, e.g. in calculating the power to detect a synergistic effect and in its application to meta-analyses. We illustrate these functions with real examples in Alzheimer's disease, e.g. a meta-analysis of the potential interaction between a BACE1 polymorphism and APOE4: SF = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.5-4.2; p = 0.0001.
Susceptibility to antibacterial agents was determined by disk diffusion and Etest. PCR was used to detect genes for accessory gene regulator (agr); capsular polysaccharide (cap) 5 and 8, staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In total 185 (92.5%) of the 200 isolates expressed resistance to antibacterial agents. They were resistant to penicillin G (82.0%), tetracycline (19.0%), erythromycin (2.5%), clindamycin (2.0%), trimethoprim (7.5%), kanamycin (2.5%), streptomycin (1.5%), ciprofloxacin (1.5%), fusidic acid (1.0%) and cadmium acetate (68.0%). Seventy-six (38.0%) and 114 (57.0%) isolates had type 5 and type 8 capsular polysaccharides respectively. The agr types I, II and III alleles were detected in 50.5%, 20.0% and 23.5% of the isolates respectively. They contained genes for SEI (38.5%), SEG (24.0%), SEC (23.0%), SEB (12.5%), SEH (21.5%), SEA (11.0), SED (1.5%), SEE (1.5%), TSST-1 (4.0%) and PVL (9.0%).
Optimal RT-qPCR conditions were determined for 60 newly designed assays. The calculated Cq (Quantification Cycle) difference, non-specific amplification, and primer dimer formation for a given assay was often dependent on primer concentration. The chosen conditions were further optimised by testing two different probe concentrations. Varying the primer concentrations had a greater effect on the performance of a RT-qPCR assay than varying the probe concentrations.
Over a mean follow-up period of 2.42 years (SD 0.97, median 2.94 years), information on the main outcome was available for 633 patients. The annual rate of transition or death was 10.5%, 15.1%, and 29.5%, respectively, for patients with mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter (Kaplan-Meier log rank test P&lt;0.001). In a Cox model comparing severe with mild changes and adjusted for clinical factors of functional decline, the risk of transition to disability or death was more than twofold higher (hazard ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 3.81). The other predictors were age group, history of atrial fibrillation, and complaint of gait disturbances. The effect of severe changes remained significant independently of baseline degree of atrophy and number of infarcts. Incident stroke and dementia only slightly modified this effect.
A decrease in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure was observed at both upper and lower limbs in student military divers after the training. Non-significant decreases in both carotido-femoral PWV and carotido-pedal PWV were found after the training. When the pulse time transit was divided by the cardiac cycle length between two R peaks ((RR) interval), a significant increase was observed between the carotid and femoral sensors. On the other hand, some differences were noticed between military divers and controls. Controls and divers were matched appropriately according to age and height, although the divers had a higher aerobic capacity as well as lower resting heart rate and lower pulse wave velocity.
McArdle's patients' blood lactate levels remained at resting levels (0.3-1.2 mmol/l) as exercise intensity increased. Nine out of 11 participants failed to demonstrate an EIGR obtaining hGH values below the clinical definition of a response (&gt;3 microg/l).
Repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant differences between conditions for somatic anxiety (F(2, 22) = 7.74, p = 0.009), self-confidence (F(2, 22) = 9.52, p = 0.001) and change in plasma cortisol concentration (F(2, 22) = 3.71, p = 0.041). Preplanned polynomial comparisons showed that these were linear effects; somatic anxiety was higher in the higher stress conditions whilst self-confidence was lower. Plasma cortisol concentration change was also linear. Regression analyses showed cubic relationships between plasma cortisol concentration and cognitive anxiety (R(2) = 0.452), self-confidence (R(2) = 0.281) and somatic anxiety (R(2) = 0.268).
More than 40% of the referees reported having incurred an injury and more than 60% having had musculoskeletal complaints during their career. About 20% of the group reported having suffered from musculoskeletal complaints in the last match. During the World Cup, 14 referees (22%) incurred an injury and more than 30% had musculoskeletal complaints. This prospectively collected data showed an incidence of 20.8 injuries per 1000 match hours (95% CI: 4.17 to 37.4). The most common acute injuries were hamstring strains, calf strains, and ankle sprains, while the most frequent locations of complaints were the low back, hamstring and knee.
During and after pain, significant decreases in knee joint dynamics and EMG recordings were observed.
Results of five prospective case series and four controlled trials (three prolotherapy, two polidocanol, three autologous whole blood and one platelet-rich plasma) suggest each of the four therapies is effective for LE. In follow-up periods ranging from 9 to 108 weeks, studies reported sustained, statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) improvement in visual analogue scale primary outcome pain score measures and disease-specific questionnaires; relative effect sizes ranged from 51% to 94%; Cohen's d ranged from 0.68 to 6.68. Secondary outcomes also improved, including biomechanical elbow function assessment (polidocanol and prolotherapy), presence of abnormalities and increased vascularity on ultrasound (autologous whole blood and polidocanol). Subjects reported satisfaction with therapies on single-item assessments. All studies were limited by small sample size.
As single markers, significant associations were found between the GG genotype of rs679620 (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.90, p = 0.010), the CC genotype of rs591058 (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.50, p = 0.023) and the AA genotype of rs650108 (OR = 4.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 24.1, p = 0.043) and risk of Achilles tendinopathy. The ATG haplotype (rs679620, rs591058, and rs650108) was under-represented in the tendinopathy group when compared to the control group (41% vs 53%, p = 0.038). Finally, the G allele of rs679620 and the T allele of COL5A1 rs12722 significantly interacted to raise risk of AT (p = 0.006). No associations were found between any of the MMP3 markers and Achilles tendon rupture.
All diagnoses could be assigned an appropriate code with OSICS-10, compared with 87% of diagnoses that could be assigned an OSICS-8 code. Contusions comprised almost half of OSICS-8 noncodeable diagnoses. OSICS-10 tier 2 codes accounted for 20% of diagnoses coded with the updated system. Of these 20%, almost half contained a more detailed diagnosis that did not have an available OSICS-10 tier 3 or 4 code. Inter-rater reliability increased with decreasing diagnostic detail, with an overall level shown to be moderate (k = 0.56).
Significant increases in self-reported balance problems, numbness and tingling were seen for both genders after aerobic exercise. For women, emotional symptoms such as irritability, sadness, nervousness and feeling more emotional decreased significantly after aerobic exercise. Headache also decreased in the women, but no significant change was seen in the men.
224 injuries (45 training, 179 match play) were registered among 208 (10%) players. No differences in training injury incidence were seen between tournaments (range 1.3-3.9 injuries/1000 hours). The men's EURO had the highest match injury incidence (41.6 injuries/1000 hours) followed by the men's Under-21 tournaments (33.9). The lowest match injury incidence was seen in the women's Under-19 tournaments (20.5). Training injuries constituted 20% of all injuries and caused 26% of all match unavailability. A greater proportion of match injuries were due to trauma (83 vs 47%, p&lt;0.001) and occurred from player contact (75 vs 48%, p = 0.018) compared to training injuries. A higher frequency of re-injury was found among training injuries than match injuries (20 vs 6%, p = 0.009).
The absolute mortality rate was 27.1, 23.6, and 18.4 per 1000 person years in the groups with low, medium, and high physical activity, respectively. The relative rate reduction attributable to high physical activity was 32% for low and 22% for medium physical activity. Men who increased their physical activity level between the ages of 50 and 60 continued to have a higher mortality rate during the first five years of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.27, compared with unchanged high physical activity). After 10 years of follow-up their increased physical activity was associated with reduced mortality to the level of men with unchanged high physical activity (1.10, 0.87 to 1.38). The reduction in mortality associated with increased physical activity (0.51, 0.26 to 0.97, compared with unchanged low physical activity) was similar to that associated with smoking cessation (0.64, 0.53 to 0.78, compared with continued smoking).
4880 children had valid PA and autorefraction data. In minimally adjusted models (age and gender) myopic children were less active than the other children: beta = -49.9 cpm (95% CI -73.5 to -26.4, p = &lt;0.001). The myopic group spent less time in MVPA than the other children: beta = -3.2 minutes MVPA (95% CI -5.2 to -1.1, p = 0.003) and more time sedentary: beta = 15.8 minutes (95% CI 5.8 to 25.8, p = 0.002). The effect sizes were attenuated by adjustment for social and behavioural confounders although myopia status in the better (less myopic on autorefraction) eye remained strongly associated with cpm and MVPA but less so for sedentary behaviour: beta = -36.8 cpm (95% CI -67.8 to -5.8, p = 0.02), beta = -2.7 MVPA (95% CI -5.3 to -0.1, p = 0.04), beta = 10.1 msed (95% CI -2.9 to 23.1, p = 0.13).
Muscle injury was observed in 25 (of 44) patients with myopathy and in 1 patient without myopathy. Only 1 patient with structural injury had a circulating level of creatine phosphokinase that was elevated more than 1950 U/L (10x the upper limit of normal). Expression of ryanodine receptor 3 was significantly upregulated in patients with biopsy evidence of structural damage (1.7, standard error of the mean 0.3).
The use of cardiovascular medications increased sharply in Canada during the study period, with related costs rising by over 200% during this period to surpass $5 billion in 2006. Changes in population demographics, risk factors and inflation appeared to account for about two-thirds of the observed growth in expenditures. Use of newer medication classes (statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors), for which patented brand name medications predominate, accounted for almost one-third of the cost increases. Interprovincial differences in total expenditures for cardiovascular drugs portrayed a descending gradient from east to west, with greatest variability for the newer drug classes.
We recruited sequentially 46 primary care providers and then 511 of their patients (mean age 60.7 [standard deviation 12.5] years). Mean follow-up was 5.9 months. The process composite score was significantly better for patients in the intervention group than for control patients (difference 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.75, p &lt; 0.001); 61.7% (156/253) of patients in the intervention group, compared with 42.6% (110/258) of control patients, showed improvement (difference 19.1%, p &lt; 0.001). The clinical composite score also had significantly more variables with improvement for the intervention group (0.59, 95% CI 0.09-1.10, p = 0.02), including significantly greater declines in blood pressure (-3.95 mm Hg systolic and -2.38 mm Hg diastolic) and glycated hemoglobin (-0.2%). Patients in the intervention group reported greater satisfaction with their diabetes care.
We show that offsets provide a useful cost containment function, even when there is some threat of reversal, by injecting additional "when-flexibility" into the system. This allows market participants to shift their reduction requirements to periods of lower cost, thereby facilitating attainment of the least-cost time path without jeopardizing the cumulative environmental integrity of the system. By accounting for market conditions in conjunction with reversal risk, we develop a simple offset valuation methodology, taking into account the two most important factors that typically lead offsets to be overvalued or undervalued.
Significantly increased levels of IL-6, C reactive protein, leptin and significantly decreased levels of adiponectin were found in obese group, while the levels of TNF-alpha and TGF-alpha were unaltered. A positive correlation between waist circumference and IL-6 was found in obese group. Similarly, C reactive protein, waist and hip circumferences were linearly correlated with BMI in obese group. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed several significant predictors for breast cancer risk.
One hundred fourteen children and adolescents ranging in age from 1 to 19 (median, 10) years at operation were followed up for as long as 25 years with a median of 19 years. The number of distal anastomoses was 1.7+/-0.8 per patient, and the internal thoracic artery was used in all but 3, most frequently for left anterior descending artery lesions. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 24 patients, mostly for non-left anterior descending artery lesions. Patients underwent multiple angiograms to evaluate their coronary and graft status. There was no operative or hospital mortality. Both 20- and 25-year survival rates were 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88 to 98). Five deaths occurred, all cardiac in origin. Cardiac event-free rates at 20 and 25 years were 67% and 60% (95% CI, 46 to 72), respectively. Percutaneous coronary intervention and reoperation were the most common events. Overall, the 20-year graft patency rate was 87% (95% CI, 78 to 93) for internal thoracic artery grafts (n=154) and 44% (95% CI, 26 to 61) for saphenous vein grafts (n=30) (P&lt;0.001), and the rate for non-left anterior descending artery lesions was also significantly better for arterial grafts (87% [95% CI, 73 to 94]; n=59) than for saphenous vein grafts (42% [95% CI, 23 to 60]; n=27) (P=0.002). Eighty-eight patients (77%) remain on medications, but all 109 survivors are presently symptom free in their daily activities.
This study consisted of 2 phases: a short-term (n=9) and long-term (n=11) canine experimental validation phase and a multicenter clinical feasibility phase (n=30 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients). After transseptal puncture, the balloon-based endoscopic ablation system was advanced to each PV ostium, and arcs of laser energy (90 degrees to 360 degrees ) were projected onto the target left atrial-PV junction. Electric PV isolation was defined with a circular multielectrode catheter. In the short-term preclinical experimental phase, 15 of 17 targeted PVs (88%) were successfully isolated. Pathological examination revealed well-demarcated circumferential lesions with minimal endothelial disruption. In the long-term experiments, 9 of 10 targeted veins (90%) remained persistently isolated (at 4 to 8 weeks). In the clinical phase, 105 of 116 PVs (91%) were successfully isolated. After a single procedure, the 12-month drug-free rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation was 60% (18 of 30 patients). There were no significant PV stenoses, but adverse events included 1 episode of cardiac tamponade, 1 stroke without residual defect, and 1 asymptomatic phrenic nerve palsy.
Lipid levels were determined at enrollment in dyslipidemic adult patients on stable lipid-lowering therapy in 9 countries. The primary end point was the success rate, defined as the proportion of patients achieving appropriate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals for their given risk. The mean age of the 9955 evaluable patients was 62+/-12 years; 54% were male. Coronary disease and diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed in 30% and 31%, respectively, and 14% were current smokers. Current treatment consisted of a statin in 75%. The proportion of patients achieving LDL-C goals according to relevant national guidelines ranged from 47% to 84% across countries. In low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, mean LDL-C was 119, 109, and 91 mg/dL and mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 62, 49, and 50 mg/dL, respectively. The success rate for LDL-C goal achievement was 86% in low-, 74% in moderate-, and 67% in high-risk patients (73% overall). However, among coronary heart disease patients with &gt; or =2 risk factors, only 30% attained the optional LDL-C goal of &lt;70 mg/dL. In the entire cohort, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was &lt;40 mg/dL in 19%, 40 to 60 mg/dL in 55%, and &gt;60 mg/dL in 26% of patients.
In this phase II dose-escalation study, patients who had undergone cardiac surgery and were bleeding were randomized to receive placebo (n=68), 40 microg/kg rFVIIa (n=35), or 80 microg/kg rFVIIa (n=69). The primary end points were the number of patients suffering critical serious adverse events. Secondary end points included rates of reoperation, amount of blood loss, and transfusion of allogeneic blood. There were more critical serious adverse events in the rFVIIa groups. These differences did not reach statistical significance (placebo, 7%; 40 microg/kg, 14%; P=0.25; 80 microg/kg, 12%; P=0.43). After randomization, significantly fewer patients in the rFVIIa group underwent a reoperation as a result of bleeding (P=0.03) or required allogeneic transfusions (P=0.01).
Two different dosages of monocrotaline were used in rats to model stable PH with preserved cardiac output and progressive PH developing right heart failure. Two weeks after injection, PH was confirmed by echocardiography, and treadmill training was initiated. Rats were trained for 4 weeks unless manifest right heart failure developed earlier. At the end of the study protocol, all rats were functionally assessed by endurance testing, echocardiography, and invasive pressure measurements. Lungs and hearts were further analyzed in quantitative histomorphologic analyses. In stable PH, exercise training was well tolerated and markedly increased exercise endurance (from 25+/-3.9 to 62+/-3.9 minutes; P&lt;0.001). Moreover, capillary density increased significantly (from 1.21+/-0.12 to 1.51+/-0.07 capillaries per cardiomyocyte; P&lt;0.05). However, in progressive PH, exercise training worsened survival (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 14.2) and increased pulmonary vascular remodeling. In addition, training induced widespread leukocyte infiltration into the right ventricle (from 135+/-14 to 276+/-18 leukocytes per 1 mm(2); P&lt;0.001).
We studied 94 patients (age, 58+/-11 years; 79% men) with chronic heart failure (CHF) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were measured as clearance of (125)I-iothalamate and (131)I-hippuran, respectively. NT-proBNP levels were determined in both plasma and 24-hour urine collections. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction of CHF patients was 0.28+/-0.09. Plasma NT-proBNP levels were higher in CHF patients compared with control subjects (median, 547 versus 41 pg/mL; P&lt;0.001). Urinary NT-proBNP excretion, however, was substantially lower in CHF patients (median, 0.13 versus 2.3 mL/min; P&lt;0.001). Urinary NT-proBNP excretion was independent of estimated glomerular filtration rate. In both CHF patients and control subjects, there was a strong and inverse relation between plasma NT-proBNP concentrations and urinary NT-proBNP excretion (r=-0.72 and r=-0.65 respectively; both P&lt;0.001). Decreased renal plasma flow in CHF was significantly associated with a lower excretion of NT-proBNP (P=0.026).
Mice with right femoral artery ligation were treated, by in vivo electrotransfer, with plasmids encoding for an irrelevant short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (shCON [control]) or specific shRNAs directed against HIF-1alpha (shHIF-1alpha), PHD1 (shPHD1), PHD2 (shPHD2), and PHD3 (shPHD3). The silencing of PHDs induced a specific and transient downregulation of their respective mRNA and protein levels at day 2 after ischemia and, as expected, upregulated HIF-1alpha. As a consequence, 2 key hypoxia-inducible proangiogenic actors, vascular endothelial growth factor-A and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, were upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA levels and infiltration of Mac-3-positive macrophages were enhanced in ischemic leg of mice treated with shPHD2 and shPHD3. Furthermore, activation of HIF-1alpha-related pathways was associated with changes in postischemic neovascularization. At day 14, silencing of PHD2 and PHD3 increased vessel density by 2.2- and 2.6-fold, capillary density by 1.8- and 2.1-fold, and foot perfusion by 1.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with shCON (P&lt;0.001). shPHD1 displayed a lower proangiogenic effect. Of interest, coadministration of shHIF-1alpha with shPHD3 abrogated shPHD3-related effects, suggesting that activation of endogenous HIF-1-dependent pathways mediated the proangiogenic effects of PHD silencing.
We prospectively followed 107 patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (aged 72 years [63 to 77]; 35 women; aortic-jet velocity, 4.1 m/s [3.5 to 4.4]) at a single center in France. Predefined end points for assessing outcome were the occurrence within 24 months of death or aortic valve replacement necessitated by symptoms or by a positive exercise test. Variables independently associated with outcome were used to build a score that was validated in an independent cohort of 107 patients from Belgium. Independent predictors of outcome were female sex, peak aortic-jet velocity, and B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline. Accordingly, the score could be calculated as follows: Score=[peak velocity (m/s) x 2]+(natural logarithm of B-type natriuretic peptide x 1.5)+1.5 (if female sex). Event-free survival after 20 months was 80% for patients within the first score quartile compared with only 7% for the fourth quartile. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the score were 0.90 and 0.89 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively.
Significantly increased levels of tenderness were discovered among patients with coronary pathology compared with healthy controls. Significantly increased levels of depression were also found, as well as higher scores on the FIQ scale. On multivariate analysis, a positive correlation was demonstrated between tenderness/FIQ scores and a composite cardiological score.
We included 320 patients with STEMI (n = 205) or NSTEMI (n = 115) with 360 lesions. Reference vessel diameter was 2.93 +/- 0.53 mm and stented length 22.7 +/- 13.8 mm. Angiographic follow-up was available in 220 of 360 lesions (61%). In-stent late loss was 0.69 +/- 0.75 mm, with a binary restenosis rate of 19.1%. For the total segment late loss was 0.74 +/- 0.77 mm and binary restenosis rate 21.4%. Clinical follow-up for 97.4% of discharged patients was available. Hierarchical MACEs were death in 14 patients (4.4%), Q-wave MI in 3 patients (0.9%), and target lesion revascularization in 39 patients (12.2%).
In post-MI patients with IVCD, the mean BNP level was significantly higher than in their counterparts without IVCD (p &lt; 0.001) and in healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.001). The highest BNP level was found in patients with LBBB and RBBB. In patients with LAH and LPH, levels of BNP were insignificantly higher than in patients without IVCD.
Forty-five of a total of 12,142 cases of aortic dissection (0.37%) occurred in persons &lt; or = 21 years old. No patient was younger than 15 years of age. Six of the 45 died (13%). Most patients were male (37 of 45, or 82%). Contrary to previous reports, the most common associated condition was trauma (19 of 45, or 42%), with Marfan syndrome the second most common (11 of 45, or 24%). Ten of 45 adolescent and young adult patients (22%) had no apparent risk factors.
Among a total of 59 patients, 28 (47%) had a history of methamphetamine abuse or positive urine toxicology. Both methamphetamine abusers and non-abusers were predominately male (64.3% vs 64.5%, P = .99), and had a high prevalence of obesity (55.6% vs 73.3%, P = .16). Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences between the methamphetamine abusers and non-abusers in left atrium volume (119.7 +/- 55.4 ml vs 85.8 +/- 33.5 ml, P = .008), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (201.9 +/- 71.4 ml vs 156.6 +/- 63.1 ml, P = .01), left ventricular end-systolic volume (136.0 +/- 53.7 ml vs 92.3 +/- 55.8 ml, P = .004), right ventricular dimension (26.3 +/- 6.0 mm vs 21.3 +/- 6.0 mm, P = .007), and quantified left ventricular ejection fraction (32.9% +/- 11.3% vs 44.6% +/- 17.8%, P = .004).
All MRCT (+) patients but 1 had dyspnea, but just 2 patients had syncope during exertion. The most frequent electrocardiographic finding was T inversion in leads V1-V3 (75%). All 6 of the MRCT (+) patients who had a cardiac arrest in the hospital died in the hospital. In comparison, of the 88 MRCT (-) patients, 12 had a cardiorespiratory arrest, 4 of whom survived (hospital mortality rate of 50% versus 9%, respectively).
There were slight changes in the heart rate and systemic blood pressure when comparing resting versus MVC-LEM values. There were much greater and significant changes (P &lt; .01) in the systemic and pulmonary blood pressures when comparing resting versus the Valsalva maneuver or the combination of the MVC-LEM plus the Valsalva maneuver values.
A total of 19,580 stents were placed in 10,396 patients. Of 6208 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria, 1630 (26.3%) received SVS, and 4578 (73.7%) received LVS. The SVS group had more female (35.5% vs 26.3%, P &lt; .001) and diabetic patients (27.9% vs 24.2%, P &lt; .003) than the LVS group. Compared with LVS, SVS lesions were shorter (14.5 +/- 5.8 mm vs 15.7 +/- 6.4 mm, P &lt; .0001) and more complex (66% vs 53% class B2/C lesions, P = .041). Indicators of procedural difficulty, including greater contrast volume, number of devices, total inflation time, and fluoroscopy time, were more commonly observed in the SVS group. After adjustment for confounding factors, the incidence of small treatment vessel diameter was significantly higher among the DES vs the BMS group (odds ratio [OR]: = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56-2.36).
In the elderly, as compared with younger subjects, dyspnea, fatigue, and other heart failure symptoms, were more frequently the first symptoms of MI than typical chest pain (p&lt;0.05). ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was also more common (p&lt;0.05). Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was more frequently diagnosed in the elderly (p&lt;0.05). In elderly patients there were more women (p&lt;0.05), more patients with previously diagnosed ischemic heart disease (p&lt;0.05), with hypertension (p&lt;0.05), and with diabetes mellitus (p&lt;0.05). Obesity was less frequently diagnosed in the elderly; however the difference was not statistically significant. Dyslipidemia and cigarette smoking were both significantly less common among elderly patients (p&lt;0.05). The elderly were significantly less frequently revascularized (p&lt;0.05). Both fibrinolysis and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were less commonly applied to the elderly (p&lt;0.05). Time from symptom onset to hospital admission was significantly longer in the case of elderly patients (p&lt;0.05). The MI complications and side effects of treatment seemed to be more frequent in the elderly, but only post-MI heart failure was observed more frequently in this group of patients (p&lt;0.05).
Female outpatients were significantly older than male outpatients (66+/-10 vs 63+/-11 years, P &lt;0.001). Male outpatients were more likely to smoke than female outpatients (P&lt;0.001). Female outpatients had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, LDL-C level, and total cholesterol level (all P values &lt;0.001). About 82% of the participants received statin therapy. The LDL-C levels were 3.06+/-1.08 mmol/L and 2.89+/-0.97 mmol/L in outpatients at high risk and very high risk respectively (P&lt;0.001). Though there were higher rates of statin intervention, only 36.2% of the high risk outpatients got to the target LDL-C level (&lt;2.6 mmol/L); 10.9% of the very high risk outpatients achieved the optimal LDL-C level (&lt;1.82 mmol/L) suggested by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. The rate of achieving target was only 42.2%, even when LDL-C &lt;2.6 mmol/L was the target level for patients at very high risk. Only 19.4% of the outpatients at very high risk achieved the target (LDL-C &lt;2.08 mmol/L) suggested by the updated Chinese guideline for CHD.
All of the group 1 patients were treated with simple lesion coverage while different stenting techniques were used in group 2 (cross-over: 44.8%, T: 6.7%, kissing: 37.8%, and crush techniques: 11.1%). The 8-month quantitative angiographic findings and in-hospital and 2 year rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were compared between the 2 groups. Although angiographic success and in-hospital MACE rates were similar in both groups with 1 cardiac death due to acute stent thrombosis in group 2, at 2-year follow-up, the MACE rate was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 at 2 years (22.2% vs 2.6%, respectively, P = 0.008). Coronary angiography revealed a significantly higher binary restenosis rate in group 2 compared with group 1 (20% vs 0%, respectively, P = 0.003).
Incidence of periprocedural myonecrosis defined as elevation of troponin I levels &gt; 1x the upper limit of normal was similar in both groups (placebo 15.4% vs drug 10.6%; P = 0.47). There was no significant difference in peak troponin I levels after PCI between the 2 groups (placebo 0.58 ng/mL +/- 1.08 ng/mL vs drug 0.97 ng/mL +/- 3.6 ng/mL; P = 0.35). Major adverse clinical events at 6 months were infrequent and not statistically different in the 2 groups (placebo 3.4% vs drug 1.2%; P = 0.52). Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment with nicardipine was not associated with reduction in the incidence of troponin I elevation (odds ratio [OR]: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-1.6; P = 0.28).
The baseline clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Although the incidence of pre-PCI thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 to 3 was significantly higher in the facilitated PCI group than in the primary PCI group (47.4% vs 15.0%, P = 0.03), the achievement of myocardial blush grade 2 to 3 or ST-segment resolution at 30 minutes after procedure was not significantly different between the facilitated PCI and the primary PCI group (36.8% vs 40%, P = 0.84 and 31.6% vs 20%, P = 0.41, respectively). Infarct size on CE-MRI was similar in the facilitated PCI group and the conventional primary PCI group (22.1% +/- 11.7% vs 25.2% +/- 13.2%, P = 0.44). At 6 months, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography was 52.6% +/- 10.4% in the facilitated PCI group and 50.9% +/- 9.8% in the primary PCI group (P = 0.68).
The prevalence of MetS was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37-43). These subjects had similar ages (54.3+/-13.4 vs 55.7+/-12.8 years), more likely to be female (43% vs 33%), had similar baseline ejection fraction (31.4+/-9.7 vs 30.0+/-11.0), and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification (2.20+/-0.9 vs 2.15+/-0.9). After 2.6+/-2.2 years of follow-up 24% of the MetS group died compared to 16% in the non-MetS group (p &lt; 0.01). The RH of death for the MetS group was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1) when compared to the non-MetS group after adjustment demographics, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker, hematocrit, creatinine, educational level, and baseline ejection fraction.
The PPARgamma mRNA was markedly decreased in the hypertensive AF group as compared with the hypertensive non-AF group, and it was significantly lower in persistent AF than paroxysmal AF (0.222 +/- 0.0702 vs 0.564 +/- 0.0436, P&lt;0.01). TNF-alpha mRNA, IL-6 mRNA, and IL-1 were increased in patients with hypertensive AF compared to the non-AF group and it was even higher in persistent AF than in paroxysmal AF (0.721 +/- 0.0541 vs 0.530 +/- 0.0496, 0.567 +/- 0.044 vs 0.457 +/- 0.0505, 325.61 +/- 88.10 vs 190.65 +/- 59.38, respectively, P&lt;0.01). TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 were in negative correlation with PPARgamma, the correlation coefficient was -0.854, -0.769, and -0.702, respectively (P&lt;0.01).
Data were available for 4247 incident PD patients, including 1605 patients with a total of 2555 peritonitis episodes. Using the negative binomial regression model, factors that were independently associated with a higher peritonitis rate included age, Black race, and having transferred from HD. There was an interaction between gender and diabetes, with an increased risk for peritonitis among female patients with diabetes. The use of CAPD versus APD did not affect the peritonitis rate. The Andersen-Gill model for recurrent events yielded similar results.
A total of 6165 patients from 22 centers in seven countries were followed for a mean of 34.0 +/- 15.8 mo; 49% were prescribed an ESA. There was increased Hb variability with ESA use; the residual SD of Hb was 4.9 +/- 4.4 g/L in patients who were not receiving an ESA, compared with 6.8 +/- 4.8 g/L. Hb variability was associated with a small but significantly increased risk for death per g/L residual SD, irrespective of ESA use. Multivariate linear regression model explained only 11% of the total variance of Hb variability.
Renal function in obese (BMI &gt; or =30) and nonobese (BMI &lt;30) donors was similar, and both donor groups had reduced renal function compared with BMI-matched two-kidney control subjects. Obesity was associated with more hypertension and dyslipidemias in both donors and two-kidney control subjects; however, there were no significant differences between the two groups within each BMI category.
Among 389 identified patients with ADPKD, 33 (8.4%) had 41 episodes of cyst infection, including eight definite and 33 likely cases. The incidence of cyst infections in patients with ADPKD was 0.01 episode per patient per year. Microbiological documentation was available for 31 episodes (75%), Escherichia coli accounting for 74% of all retrieved bacterial strains. Positron emission tomography scan proved superior to ultrasound, Computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of infected cysts. Clinical efficacy of initial antibiotic treatment was noted in 71% of episodes. Antibiotic treatment modification was more frequently required for patients who were receiving initial monotherapy compared with those who were receiving bitherapy. Large (diameter &gt;5 cm) infected cysts frequently required drainage.
At RRT, patients from the CRI clinic had better hemoglobin, lower parathyroid hormone and calcium phosphorus product than patients followed in the general nephrology clinic. More patients from the general nephrology clinic had an unplanned initiation of dialysis compared with patients from the CRI clinic (50% versus 10.5%, P &lt; 0.05).
A total of 192 patients (56% men, mean age 54.3 +/- 15.3; 32% with diabetes) were included. On univariate analysis, Pcl was negatively correlated with serum albumin and positively correlated with age, dialysate/plasma creatinine ratio (D/Pcr), the presence of peripheral vascular disease, and urine volume. On multivariate analysis, serum albumin, D/Pcr, urine volume, and peripheral vascular disease remained significant. Predictors of mortality were age, comorbidity grade, and Pcl but not D/Pcr.
The maximum serum concentration observed with a 6 mg/kg post-HD dose was 61.1 +/- 7.6 microg/ml with a mean protein binding of 89.2%. Intradialytic daptomycin administration resulted in reduced maximum serum concentration and area under the curve values that were approximately 12 to 20% lower when administered during HD with LP dialyzers and approximately 35% lower with HP dialyzers.
Almost half (46%) of candidates who were older than 60 yr and listed in 2006 through 2007 are projected to die before receiving a DDTx. This proportion varied by individual characteristics: Diabetes (61%), age &gt; or =70 yr (52%), black (62%), blood types O (60%) and B (71%), highly sensitized (68%), and on dialysis at listing (53%). Marked variation also existed by United Network for Organ Sharing region (6 to 81%). The overall projected proportion was reduced to 35% excluding patients who initially were listed as status 7.
Forty-six cases were identified; 19 had their first PD exposure after January 1, 2000. The rate was 1.5%, an incidence of 4.9 per 1000 person-years. The incidence increased with PD duration, with rates of 0, 0.6, 2.0, 3.5, 8.1, 8.8 and 5% at &lt;1, 1 to 2, &gt;2 to 3, &gt;3 to 4, &gt;4 to 5, &gt;5 to 6 and &gt;6 yr PD exposure, respectively. The median PD duration of EPS cases was 5.1 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 3.4 to 6.1 yr). At diagnosis, 12 (26%) were on PD and 33 (72%) were diagnosed &lt;2 yr after PD stopped. The cases had a median of 3.3 episodes of peritonitis (range 0 to 20, IQR 1 to 4.5). Thirty (65%) had used 3.86% dextrose dialysate and 45 (98%) had used Extraneal. The mortality was 42% at 1 yr postdiagnosis with a median survival of 149 d (IQR 61 to 408 d).
The baseline IL-6 value was 2.9 +/- 1.9 pg/ml (n = 1751) and that of hsCRP was 3.8 +/- 6.7 mg/L (n = 1910). After adjustment for baseline values for established risk factors, the hazard ratios for a major cardiac event and all-cause mortality for IL-6 were 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01 to 1.15, P = 0.018] and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.18, P &lt; 0.001), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for hsCRP for a cardiovascular event was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.20, P = 0.027) and for all-cause mortality was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.1.25, P = 0.049).
Within a claims-ascertainment period spanning +/-30 d of clinically recorded dates, aggregate sensitivity of single claims was higher for case definitions incorporating Medicare Parts A and B for diagnoses and procedures (90.9%) compared with either Part A (82.3%) or Part B (84.6%) alone. Perfect capture of the four procedures was possible within +/-30 d or with short claims window expansion, but sensitivity for the diagnoses trended lower with all study algorithms (91.2% with window up to +/-90 d). Requirement for additional confirmatory diagnosis claims did not appreciably reduce sensitivity. Sensitivity patterns were similar in the early compared with late periods of the study.
Net PET ultrafiltration volume was independent of gender, age, diabetes, residual renal function, peritoneal dialysis prescriptions (modes and dialysates), extracellular fluid volume, or C-reactive protein (CRP). There was an inverse regression with serum albumin and sodium on multiple logistical regression analysis (F = 13.4, P &lt; 0.001 and F = 10.1, P = 0.001, respectively) and a positive regression with 24-h net peritoneal ultrafiltration volumes (F = 15.5, P &lt; 0.001). As expected, there was a strong correlation with net sodium losses (r = 0.99, P &lt; 0001).
The rate of long-term AEs was higher in individuals with CIN (all definitions of CIN). After adjustment for baseline comorbidities and risk factors, the adjusted incidence rate ratio for AEs was twice as high in those with CIN. Randomization to iopamidol reduced both the incidence of CIN and AEs.
A total of 2,002 patients were entered into the registry. One-third had at least one CTO. At 1 year, the mortality in patients with a CTO was significantly higher than in those without a CTO (5.5 vs. 3.1%; P = 0.009). This excess mortality was related to a higher prevalence of confounding factors in patients with a CTO such as diabetes and more severe LV dysfunction. Patients with a CTO were more likely to undergo surgery or being treated medically, whereas patients without a CTO were more likely to undergo PCI. If a CTO was treated by PCI the periprocedural and long-term outcome was similar to those with PCI for a non-occlusive lesion. However, periprocedural MACE was higher for patients treated for a non-occlusive lesion without first treating the CTO.
Baseline characteristics were broadly similar to the main ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trials, except for a higher frequency of coronary artery disease and Asian ethnicity in the substudy. Reproducibility of MRI analyses (mean +/- SD) were 2.8 +/- 3.7 ml in EDV, -0.3 +/- 3.6 ml in ESV, 3.1 +/- 3.3 ml in SV, 1.1 +/- 1.8% in EF, and 0.4 +/- 4.5 g in LVM. Subgroup analyses revealed increased ESV and LVM, and reduced EF, in subjects with a history of either coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction.
Main causes of the 47 (21.2%) early deaths were septic multiorgan failure in 23 (48.9%) and myocardial failure in 10 (21.3%) patients with a significantly better survival for NVE than for PVE patients (patients = 0.029). The highest ORs were found in the univariate analysis for preoperative development of septic shock (OR 14.28), preoperative necessity of ventilation (OR 7.08), high doses of catecholamines (OR 5.60), severe aortic root destruction (OR 5.12), emergency operation (OR 4.25) and persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment (OR 4.11). Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative ventilation (OR 5.43), persistent fever under antibiotic treatment (OR 2.84) and prosthetic endocarditis (OR 2.32) were independent risk factors for early mortality.
Results from open label and double-blind studies by several groups have indicated that CSIs may be efficacious or of adjunctive value in some patients with depression, including those refractory to other agents; however, there is a need for more controlled studies. Several lines of data suggest that the mechanism of action of these agents may not be solely a function of inhibition of adrenal cortisol production.
Event-free remission with the end point defined as relapse (Hamilton Depression Rating Scores higher than 8) was 75.3% (73.7) at 2 months, 60.0% (74.5) at 3 months, 42.7% (74.8) at 4 months, and 22.6% (74.5) at 6 months. According to a multivariate analysis, only the age and number of sessions were independent predictors of outcome. Although depression severity and use of tricyclics also showed a significant relationship with remission duration, the model including these variables was not adequate to explain our data.
The MBCT group demonstrated significantly more improvement than the ADE group according to all anxiety (HAM-A, p&lt;0.01; BAI, p&lt;0.01; anxiety subscale of SCL-90-R, p=0.01) and depression (HAM-D, p&lt;0.01; BDI, p&lt;0.01; depression subscale of SCL-90-R, p&lt;0.01) scale scores. The obsessive-compulsive and phobic subscales of the SCL-90-R also showed significantly more improvement in the MBCT group. However, no significant improvement was observed in the MBCT group versus the ADE group in terms of the somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid ideation, or psychoticism subscale scores of the SCL-90-R.
Past year antidepressant use.
Compared to non-Latino Whites, few Latinos, primarily Mexican Americans, with 12-month depressive and/or anxiety disorders reported past year antidepressant use. Mexican Americans (OR=0.48; 95%CI=0.30-0.77) had significantly lower odds of use compared to non-Latino Whites, which were largely unaffected by factors associated with access to care. Over half of antidepressant use was by respondents not meeting 12-month criteria for depressive or anxiety disorders. Lifetime depressive and anxiety disorders explained another 21% of past year antidepressant use, leaving another 31% of drug use unexplained.
No significant differences emerged between the RCT participants and clinic patients for sex, age, marital status, and education. Overall, clinic patients were no more severely depressed compared to RCT participants; there was, however, a significant interaction effect. Response rates were significantly higher for RCT participants versus clinic patients. Those participating in the RCT scored significantly higher on a personality scale assessing preference for novel experiences compared to those in the clinic.
Of 2,864 outpatients who returned for &gt;or=2 post baseline visits, 150 (5.2%) had worsened depression at study exit. Baseline characteristics independently associated with increased worsened depression included African-American race (OR=2.02), having less than a college education (OR=2.36), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR=1.78), drug abuse (OR=1.97), hypochondriasis (OR=2.74). Participants with worsened depression spent less time in treatment; had fewer treatment visits; exited the study sooner; had more frequent, intense, and burdensome adverse effects; and were more intolerant of medication.
Ten patients were initially treated with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), whereas one patient was initially treated with an antipsychotic. Three of the 10 patients who started with an SRI had a response (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I)&gt;or=2) in TTM symptoms. Nine patients of the 11 patients were treated with an antipsychotic medication (in 8 patients the antipsychotic was added after an initial trial with an SRI, in 1 patient the antipsychotic was the first line agent), 2 patients remained on an SRI; 8/9 were responders to antipsychotic treatment and 2 patients remitted (complete cessation of hair pulling). Adverse events to the SRI or antipsychotic were experienced by 7/11 patients but did not lead to treatment discontinuation.
In the FLX group recovery measured by the decrease in the HDRS during the 4-month follow-up associated with baseline mature defense style (r=-.59, P=.015). There were no correlations between the PMS-scores and the outcome measures in either treatment groups nor defense status and the outcome in the STPP group.
Although both protocols significantly decreased the score of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression over the trial period, the combination of fluoxetine and celecoxib showed a significant superiority over fluoxetine alone in the treatment of symptoms of major depression. There were no significant differences in the two groups in terms of observed side effects.
follow-up ranged from 2 to 7.4 years. The studies were methodologically rigorous and, in general, showed maintenance of or improvement in acute treatment gains. The studies reviewed could not outline course of recovery or control for pivotal confounding variables such as maturation. Seven of the eight studies employed a Cognitive Behavioral intervention and one employed a manualized, time-limited, psychodynamic intervention. No LTFU trial for medication was found.
Participants showed significant improvement from pre- to post-treatment on the Saving Inventory Revised, Saving Cognitions Inventory, Clutter Image Rating, and Clinical Global Severity. The most recent group (n=8) that used a more formalized treatment and research protocol improved significantly more than did earlier members.
Regardless of income level, remission rates were lower for participants who dropped out of treatment. Attrition rates increased as income decreased. For all income levels, younger age was independently associated with attrition. For the lowest income level, less education, better mental health functioning, being on public insurance, and having more concurrent Axis I conditions were associated with a greater likelihood of attrition. For the middle income group, less education, better mental health functioning, being Black or of another non-White race, and treatment in a psychiatric versus primary-care setting predicted greater attrition. For the highest income group, being Hispanic, having a family history of drug abuse, and melancholic features predicted attrition. Atypical symptom features (middle income group) and recurrent depression (highest income group) were associated with retention.
The resulting model simulates the incidence and prevalence of diabetes and 10 of its most commonly associated C&amp;Cs, reflecting their interrelated upstream and downstream relationships. The simulator enables systematic evaluation of tens of thousands of potential combinations of emerging technologies and technology leverage points that can be used to improve patient outcomes and guide technology investments. Feasibility was demonstrated through single, pair-wise, and targeted analyses of technologies.
Six hundred sixty-seven individuals with type 2 diabetes participated (mean age, 57 years; 52% female; 88% Caucasian; 73% vial/syringe users, 27% insulin pen users). IDS satisfaction was associated (P &lt; 0.05) with gender, health status, HbA1c, self-reported comorbidity, insulin therapy attitudes, IDS type, and evaluation of IDS features. Among individuals who reported their HbA1c (n = 438), the best predictors of IDS satisfaction were perceived effectiveness and value of insulin therapy, evaluation of IDS activity interference, and commitment to insulin therapy (R2 = 0.49, P &lt; 0.001). Among all participants (n = 667), a second regression analysis that employed a variable representing report of HbA1c found the best predictors of IDS satisfaction included those in the first analysis with the addition of gender, report of HbA1c, and evaluation of IDS ease of use. These variables provided additional variance (R2 = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001).
Inhaled insulin was well tolerated in all eight patients who had previously experienced significant problems with initiation or intensification of subcutaneous insulin injections. Mean hemoglobin A1c was 10.7% (range, 8.1-14.2%) at initiation, 8.3% (7.2-9.4%) at 3 months, 7.7% (6.9-9.0%) at 6 months, 7.4% (6.7-8.4%) at 9 months, and 7.5% (6.5-8.7%) at 12 months. At 6 months, six patients had a reduction in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) by 4-12%, whereas five patients had a reduction of 2-12% at 12 months. One developed dyspnea, with a 29% fall in FEV1, which was transient and secondary to an upper respiratory tract infection. Two patients with the highest starting and most improved hemoglobin A1c developed significant retinopathy.
A total of 328 type 2 diabetes patients were recruited from 35 family practices in the province of Málaga, Spain. There was a reduction in hemoglobin A1c after 12 months from 7.62 +/- 1.60% to 7.40 +/- 1.43% (P = 0.027) in the intervention group and from 7.44 +/- 1.31% to 7.35 +/- 1.38% (P = 0.303) in the control group. The difference in the change between groups was not statistically significant. There was also a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index in the intervention group. In the control group, the only significant decline was in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Seventy-two percent of patients began insulin therapy using pen devices for insulin delivery, increasing from 46% in 1998 to 86% in 2006. Insulin initiation by a specialist was positively associated with the use of pen devices (odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-2.40), whereas long-term care residence (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.49-0.54) and initiation during hospitalization (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.78) were negatively associated.
Ca2+-containing Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium was more effective than RPMI 1640 medium by increasing transfection efficiency (2.5-fold). An increase in pDNA dose slightly reduced the transfection efficiency but had minimal influence on islet loss. However, the N/P ratio had a large effect on islet viability and transfection efficiency. For example, the PEI/pDNA ratio at N/P = 10 caused greater islet loss (56% vs. 28%) and 30-fold less transfection efficiency than at N/P = 5. Even under a set of best conditions selected from this study, mostly a fraction of cells located in the peripheral regions of an islet were transfected, and the viability and insulin secretion from the treated islets were not altered. However, it was found that the extent of apoptosis was noticeably higher (approximately 16%) than in untreated islets (approximately 2%).
There was no difference in pancreatic uptake of [18F]FBT on baseline scans between the two groups. Pancreatic uptake of [18F]FBT increased in every subject after dextrose infusion (P = 0.03). On post-dextrose PET scans, pancreatic uptake of [18F]FBT was significantly higher in IGT subjects compared with NGT subjects (P = 0.03). The post-dextrose to pre-dextrose uptake ratios were higher in IGT subjects (P = 0.08).
The results of our study have shown that the median time (interquartile range) to maximum glucose levels in OGTT was 38 (25-49) min after glucose load and that the median time to maximum glucose levels after breakfast, lunch, and dinner was 40 (31-75), 50 (30-70), and 45 (36-50) min, respectively. The median increase in glucose during OGTT was 45 (35-66) mg/dL, and that after breakfast, lunch and dinner was 21 (12-32), 37 (27-48), and 44 (25-63) mg/dL, respectively. Those with a higher insulinogenic index reached their maximum glucose levels in a shorter time (r = -0.46, P = 0.025) and had smaller glucose increments during OGTT (r = -0.49, P = 0.014).
There were significant impairments in skin moisture, sweat, skin blood flow, and the galvanic skin response at any of the three environmental temperatures in subjects with diabetes compared to older subjects compared to younger subjects (analysis of variance, P &lt; 0.01). Both a reduction in skin blood flow and impaired sweating contributed to the higher galvanic skin resistance seen in subjects with diabetes. The greatest contributor was impaired sweating.
The 268 patients with colon cancer and 89 with rectal cancer were similar in gender, tumor size, stage, and differentiation. Colon cancers had a higher incidence of microsatellite instability (27 percent) and methylator phenotype (28 percent) compared with rectal cancers (7 percent, 3 percent, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Although KRAS mutation rate was similar, colon cancers had a higher incidence of BRAF mutations (16.7 percent vs. 0 percent; P &lt; 0.001). Microsatellite stable tumors had an increased risk of disease recurrence compared with microsatellite unstable tumors (odds ratio, 3.86). Despite overall differences in outcome between colon and rectal cancers, no significant difference in survival existed when similar molecular phenotypes were compared across anatomic sites.
A total of 12,128 patients underwent anterior resection or abdominoperineal excision for Dukes A-C cancer in 101 centers; 2,625 patients (21.6 percent) underwent abdominoperineal excision (median, 20.8 (interquartile range, 16.5-27.9) percent per unit). Abdominoperineal excision rates decreased from 24.3 to 18.2 percent (P &lt; 0.001) and varied between the least and most deprived groups from 18 to 26.4 percent, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Independent predictors of abdominoperineal excision were: year of surgery (odds ratio = 0.855 per year increase, P &lt; 0.001), female vs. male gender (odds ratio = 0.82, P &lt; 0.001), use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (odds ratio = 2.4, P &lt; 0.001), and social deprivation (most vs. least deprived: odds ratio = 1.638, P &lt; 0.001).
A total of 442 and 5,617 patients were included in Groups A and B, respectively. The median interval between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy was 46 days in Group A and 42 days in Group B. Although 17 percent and 11 percent of patients in Groups A and B, respectively, waited three or more months for adjuvant chemotherapy, median overall survival was worse in this subset than in those who waited less than 3 months (54 vs. 76 months, P &lt; 0.01). Postoperative hospital stay independently predicted for adjuvant chemotherapy delay in both groups. Disparities in delays were seen only in Group B, such that patients who were older or black had greater odds of an adjuvant chemotherapy delay (for both, P &lt; 0.05).
There were no mortalities. Neorectal mucosal prolapse in patients with total intersphincteric resection and coloanal anastomotic stenosis in patients with subtotal or partial intersphincteric resection were observed as characteristic late complications. The five-year disease-free survival rates classified according to the TNM stage were 100 percent for stage I, 83.5 percent for stage II, and 72.0 percent for stage III cases. The five-year cumulative local recurrence rate after intersphincteric resection was 2.5 percent. Defecatory function, which was evaluated by bowel movement in a 24-hour period, and continence after intersphincteric resection were objectively good. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that age was the only factor associated with a risk of fecal incontinence.
Two hundred twenty-seven participants were selected from 18 eligible studies, including our own patients (n = 13). The average age of disease onset was 64 years. The typical symptoms included tenesmus, hematochezia, and diarrhea. One hundred sixty-three of the 227 patients in these studies were classified as having diverticular-associated colitis, of which 142 were managed medically. Twenty-eight patients eventually required an operation. One-quarter (37 of 163) of the patients had recurrence of symptoms with an average follow-up time of three years.
The steroid and placebo groups were well balanced for preoperative variables, as were the subgroups of patients who underwent laparoscopic (methylprednisolone, n = 13; placebo, n = 13) and open surgery (methylprednisolone, n = 13; placebo, n = 13). No adverse events related to steroid administration occurred. In the methylprednisolone groups, significant improvement in pulmonary performance (P = 0.01), pain control (P = 0.001), and length of stay (P = 0.03) were observed independent of the surgical technique. No differences in morbidity or anastomotic leak rate were observed among groups.
Thirty-one of 44 (71 percent) patients were contacted. Median follow-up time was 129 (range, 113 to 208) months. Median age at surgery was 44 (range, 22 to 80) years. No patients were fully continent at 129 months. Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scores were correlated with the age at surgery. Older patients had lower Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scores (P = 0.001), reflecting a lower quality of life, and a higher patient-rated Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score (P = 0.01) and a higher surgeon-rated Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score (P = 0.005), denoting more severe fecal incontinence. The Bristol Stool Form Scale, not utilized at 77 months, showed a correlation to patient-rated Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (P = 0.04) and surgeon-rated Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (P = 0.02). Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores were significantly higher in women who had more than two vaginal births.
Twenty-one patients responded to the questionnaires; mean follow-up time was 105 (SD, 33.6) months. Analyzing the Wexner incontinence score, the group median improved from 15 (range, 4-20) before the procedure to 8 (range, 2-18; P &lt; 0.001) at follow-up.Conversely, postoperatively there was no difference in symptoms of urinary incontinence between groups. The Female Sexual Function Index of case patients was significantly lower than that of control patients (cases, 16.2 [2.3-33.6]; controls, 26.1 [3.3-36]; P = 0.004). The Short-Form-12 physical health score was similar for both groups (mean +/- standard deviation: cases, 46.1 +/- 10.8; controls, 48.6 +/- 11.4; P = 0.220), whereas the mental health score of patients was significantly lower than that of controls (cases, 39.8 +/- 10.5; controls, 47.1 +/- 8.5; P = 0.0057).
The median number of incontinence episodes during four weeks was 22 (range, 2 to 77) before treatment, at 6 months it was 9 (range, 0 to 46), and at 12 months it was 10 (range, 0 to 70, P = 0.004). Fifteen patients (44 percent) were responders at 6 months, compared with 19 (56 percent) at 12 months. No long-term side effects or serious adverse events were reported.
The median diameter was 3 cm and median distance was 8 cm. The peritoneum was opened peroperatively without any adverse effects in 8.7 percent. The conversion rate was 9.6 percent, with an alternative local procedure performed in 4.2 percent and a transabdominal procedure performed in 5.4 percent. Conversion rate correlated with the distance of the tumor (P = 0.007) and the operating surgeon's level of experience (P = 0.004). The median operation time was 45 minutes. Operation time correlated with specimen area, experience, and operating surgeon (all P &lt; 0.001). All rectal adenomas were excised in one piece. Complete margins were observed in 85 percent. Rectal adenomas with incomplete margins were larger (P &lt; 0.001) and were located more proximally (P &lt; 0.001). Morbidity was 7.8 percent and mortality 0.6 percent. The median hospital stay was four days. The median follow-up was 27 months. The recurrence rate at three years was 9.1 percent. The median time from operation to recurrence was 12 (range, 4-54) months. Resection margin status was a predictor of recurrence, with 6.1 percent recurrence in cases of complete margins and 25.2 percent in cases of incomplete margins (P &lt; 0.001).
The presence of vascular invasion independently predicted adverse outcome (P &lt; 0.001; hazard ratio = 1.52 (1.3 to 1.8)) and decreased survival from 49.0 to 19.0 months (P &lt; 0.001) even in lymph node-positive patients. Tumor border configuration, Ki67, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein expression were predictive of vascular invasion. The cross-validated misclassification rate was 23.7 percent indicating a significant predictive accuracy of this model.
Compared with female patients, male patients had a larger area of overall mesorectal package (3,776 mm2 vs. 2,772 mm2, P = 0.001), larger area of mesorectal fat (2,562 mm2 vs. 1,842 mm2, P = 0.001), and higher ratio of anteroposterior to transverse diameter of the mesorectal package (0.82 vs. 0.56, P &lt; 0.001). The anterior mesorectal fat buffer was significantly thinner in females than in males (2.9 mm vs. 7.8 mm, P &lt; 0.001). Mesorectal fat area was greater in males with a body mass index &gt;25 than with a body mass index &lt;25.
Of 516 patients, 473 (92 percent) participated. Overall, 208 patients (44 percent) had at least one anal macroscopic lesion: 108 patients (22.8 percent) had human papilloma (HPV)-related lesions (condyloma with or without dysplasia), 67 (14.2 percent) had hemorrhoidal disease, 50 (10.6 percent) had anal fissures, and 44 (9.3) percent had other anal lesions. Independent significantly associated factors for anal condyloma were history of anal condyloma (OR, 2.09) and median number of episodes of sexual intercourse per month (OR, 1.03) in men who have sex with men; history of genital condyloma (OR, 26.74), and unprotected sexual intercourse (OR, 7.47) in heterosexual men; and CD4 cell count below 200/mm3 (OR, 6.02), receptive anal intercourse (OR, 6.37), and history of anal condyloma (OR, 16.69) in women. Neither sexual behavior nor characteristics related to HIV infection were associated with hemorrhoidal disease or anal fissure.
Overall 170 patients were included. Post-chemoradiotherapy CEA levels &lt;5 ng/ml were associated with increased rates of complete clinical response and pathologic response. Additionally, postchemoradiotherapy CEA levels &lt;5 ng/ml were associated with increased overall and disease-free survival (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03). There was no correlation between initial CEA level or reduction in CEA and complete response or survival.
Between February 2005 and August 2007, 52 patients were treated; median age was 53.5 years. The confirmed overall response rate was 30.8 percent, and the disease control rate was 67.3 percent. Median time to progression was 3.1 months, and median overall survival was 8.1 months. Of the 27 patients evaluable for epidermal growth factor receptor status, epidermal growth factor receptor expression was positive in 12 patients (44.4 percent) using the clone H11 antibody test and in 26 patients (96.3 percent) with the PharmDx kit.
Five patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, and four underwent distal pancreatectomy. A left lateral liver section and three colon resections were simultaneously performed in four patients. There was no postoperative mortality, and only two patients experienced complications. Survival averaged 19.8 (median, 17.0; range, 5-30) months: seven patients died of metastatic disease, one for unrelated disease after five months, and one is alive with liver metastases 30 months after surgery.
Chromoendoscopy detected the greatest number of lesions at all sites within the large intestine, and it detected a significantly greater number than the other procedures on the left side of the large intestine. Narrow-band imaging depicted a greater number of lesions than did white light in the transverse colon, descending colon, and rectum. Autofluorescence imaging showed a greater number of lesions than did white light in the rectum. The total number of depicted lesions under chromoendoscopy (43.3 +/- 38.5) was significantly greater than the total number detected with white light (12.2 +/- 13.9, P = 0.005), autofluorescence imaging (21.4 +/- 27.5, P = 0.0006), and narrow-band imaging (20.1 +/- 21.5, P = 0.003). Narrow-band imaging detected a significantly higher total number of lesions than did white light (P = 0.04).
One hundred seventy-nine patients were studied (91 with colorectal cancer, 88 with adenomas). Preoperative colorectal cancer platelet-derived growth factor-BB levels were higher (1,771.1 pg/ml; confidence intervals, 1,429-2,065) than in the benign neoplasm group (1083 pg/ml; confidence intervals, 933-1,192, P &lt; 0.001). In patients with colorectal cancer, a direct relationship was noted between platelet-derived growth factor-BB levels and disease severity. Despite the increase in platelet-derived growth factor-BB noted with increasing stage, the differences between the Stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 groups were not significant.
All patients were discharged within 24 hours. Total complication rate was 7.2 percent and recurrence rate was 0.7 percent. The mean time off from work was 12 +/- 2 days (range, 10 to 22). The mean follow-up period was 66 +/- 32 months (range, 12 to 120).
Questionnaires were mailed to 913 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons fellows, and 63 percent responded. For a patient who has had a prior colectomy and is not taking steroids, 27 percent of surgeons would perform ileal pouch-anal anastomosis alone, and 73 percent would perform ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with a loop ileostomy. For a patient who has not had previous surgery and is taking prednisone 40 mg/day, 16 percent of surgeons would perform a subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy, 82 percent would perform a total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with a loop ileostomy, and 2 percent would perform a total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis without an ileostomy. There was no relationship between practice setting, annual ileal pouch-anal anastomosis volume, or years in practice and surgeon response for either scenario.
Patients with Cushing's syndrome had higher levels of clotting factors II (P = 0.003), V (P &lt; 0.001), VIII (P &lt; 0.001), IX (P &lt; 0.001), XI (P &lt; 0.001) and XII (P = 0.019), protein C (P &lt; 0.001), protein S (P &lt; 0.001), C1-inhibitor (P &lt; 0.001) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (P = 0.004). The activity of fibrinolytic markers, plasminogen (P &lt; 0.001), antithrombin (P &lt; 0.001) and antithrombin antigen (P = 0.001) was also increased in the patient group.
Integrated residents (IRs) perform significantly better than traditional residents on In-Training Examinations at each year of residency training, with the difference in mean scores decreasing over time (67.8, 39.6, and 33.0 points better in the first, second, and third residency years). No evidence of increased patient continuity or panel size was noted. A higher proportion of IRs serve as chief residents, rate their residency experience as "excellent," and remain with the program through graduation. Practice characteristics immediately after residency do not significantly differ. Financial benefits are evident for the IRs as well as the hosting department.
Clustering by program type, family medicine programs were primarily represented in the high-intensity group (standard residual -1.6), while internal medicine programs were primarily represented in the low-intensity group (standard residual 2.5, X2=14.80, df=6). Emergency medicine comprised the mid-intensity groups. The high- intensity group scored very high or high on areas including knowledge of elder abuse facts, elder abuse curriculum and training, and awareness of community resources related to elder abuse.
Students showed a significant improvement in knowledge between pretesting and immediate posttesting across a range of topics. Long-term knowledge retention was more limited. The majority of students reported enthusiasm for this topic and found the materials essential for their training.
Eighty-four individuals reported perfect (score of 50) CARE scores. They tended to be older with less education but reported similar health status, quality of life, and levels of optimism. In those with perfect CARE scores, cold duration was shorter (mean 7.10 days versus 8.01 days), and there was a trend toward reduced severity (mean area under receiver-operator characteristics curve 240.40 versus 284.49). After accounting for possible confounding variables, cold severity and duration were significantly lower in those reporting perfect CARE scores. In these models, a perfect score also correlated with a larger increase in IL-8 levels.
Obese patients of physicians who had a BMI chart prompt in their medical records were significantly more likely than obese patients of physicians who did not receive a BMI chart prompt to receive a diagnosis of obesity (16.6% versus 10.7%; P=.016). Patients of physicians who were provided with a BMI chart prompt were also more likely than patients of physicians who did not get a chart prompt to receive a referral for diet treatment (14.0% versus 7.3%, P=.002) and exercise (12.1% versus 7.1%, P=.016). Of the obesity comorbidities, only obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was a predictor of a patient being diagnosed with obesity (OR=.49, 95% CI=0.281, 0.869, P=.014).
Two key themes emerged: (1) barriers (ie, level of computer literacy, training required, and time) and facilitators (ie, having an in-house problem solver and the EMR's integrated messaging system), and (2) a continuum of EMR adoption (ie, levels of knowledge ranging from novice to advanced and responses to the EMR that included participants' reflections on their personal journey across the adoption continuum and that of their practice sites).
All patients completed the planned treatment schedule and stated a compliance of 33% in group 2, 83% in group 3, 66% in group 4 and 100% in group 5. Peak systolic velocity of the popliteal artery blood flow increased over baseline values particularly when IPC lasted 4 months (group 2: 85%, group 3: 81% vs. group 4: 76%, group 5: 73%). These beneficial effects lasted 10 months and vanished 14 months after the end of IPC treatment. The absolute claudication distance increased at the end of the treatment of 101% in group 2, 94% in group 3, 86% in group 4, and 83% in group 5, and it was still increased over the baseline values 14 months after the end of the treatment. No differences have been observed whether the treatment was performed once- or thrice-a-day.
Suction drainage was removed between post-operative (p.o.) days 3 and 4. Seroma magnitude and duration were significantly reduced (p 0.004 and 0.02, respectively), and there were fewer evacuative punctures, in patients receiving fibrin glue compared with the conventional treatment group.
A total of 320 patients were included, 240 submitted to haemorrhoidectomy for prolapse and 80 surgically treated for anal fissures. Anesthesia obtained has been satisfactory in the all treated patients and has not been observed permanent side-effects. Among the early post-operative complications it has been observed urinary retention in 9% of patients and pain in 30%. Among late post-operative complications it has been observed pain in 8% and urinary retention in 1% of patients. In two patients has been observed the development of abscess in correspondence of anaesthetic infiltration area. The local anaesthetical effect was present for a mean period of 4-8 hours.
Item analysis yielded 80 items distributed across 10 scales, with median administration time of 17 minutes [IQR 13.5-22 minutes] and minimal missing data. There were few floor or ceiling effects in scale score distributions. Internal consistency reliability was &gt;or= 0.78 for all scales; test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation) estimates exceeded 0.70 for 6 scales. More hours weekly spent in caregiving was uniquely associated with worse quality of life on 8 scales (p's &lt;or= 0.05). Three higher-order dimensions of caregiving assistance, emotional and social concerns, and spirituality and benefits were identified.
Two hundred and eighteen women were recruited. The digital examination had a moderate inter-observer reliability with a kappa value of 0.54. The POP-Q showed a high degree of reliability (0.88). There was a high degree of correlation between the POP-Q findings in left lateral and lithotomy position (rho &gt; 0.95, p &lt; 0.001).
Forty-eight percent of these women sought medical attention "immediately" after discovering a bulge. The median time to seek care was 4 months (range from 1 month to 45 years). Twenty-six percent associated their prolapse with a specific event (e.g., moving furniture or pushing a car). POP was self-discovered by 76% (81/107) of women. Self-discovered prolapses were larger than those diagnosed by physicians (Ba +1.3 vs 0.1 cm, P = .03, respectively).
We identified 50 patients who underwent the test. Pain level increased mildly but significantly during the urodynamic test (1.24 +/- 0.9 vs 0.02 +/- 0.14 p &lt; 0.001) and decreased thereafter (0.1 +/- 0.35, p &lt; 0.001).
Mean age was 55 years (range, 17-87 years). Of 420 women with complete datasets, 104 (25%) were diagnosed with a puborectalis muscle avulsion. These women were less likely to suffer from stress urinary incontinence (SUI; P &lt; 0.001) and urodynamic stress incontinence (USI; P = 0.065) and more likely to present with symptoms of prolapse (P &lt; 0.001) and show signs of voiding dysfunction (P = 0.005). The negative association between avulsion and SUI persisted in multivariate models.
Nine hundred ten women were included: 273 diabetics and 637 non-diabetics. Diabetes was shown to be associated with a 2.5-fold risk increase for urinary incontinence (UI), and age and BMI were weakly associated with UI. UI was significantly more prevalent in diabetic women: 41% diabetic and 22.1% non-diabetic women reported UI (p &lt; 0.001). Age, BMI, and DM were revealed as independent determinants of UI in adult women. Urge incontinence was more prevalent in non-diabetic women, whereas stress and mixed incontinence were more prevalent among diabetic women.
A total of 2,062 workers, including 118 pregnant and 1,944 nonpregnant women, participated in the study. Pregnancy was a significant risk factor for both symptomatic (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33) and asymptomatic (OR = 2.13) UTIs. Urine voiding three or more times during a shift was a significant protective factor for asymptomatic UTI (OR = 0.40).
Fifty-nine women sustained OASIS. At 7 weeks, six (10%) had a defect on ultrasound. There was no significant deterioration in symptoms of fecal urgency, incontinence, or quality of life at 1 year after delivery.
The mean interval from referral to first visit improved from 15.6 weeks (range = 12-32 weeks) to 4.6 weeks (range = 1-11 weeks, SD = 1.97) after UTC. Compared to pre-UTC, the mean period from first visit to final outcome improved from 11 months (range = 3.0-23.0 months) to 8.8 weeks (range = &lt;1-60 weeks, SD = 11.15). Fifty-nine percent were discharged from the UTC without being seen by a specialist.
Two hundred sixty-six responses were obtained for a 23% response rate. Of the 235 respondents actively performing sacrocolpopexies, 133 (57%) would not perform a prophylactic Burch colposuspension at the time of sacrocolpopexy in a woman without symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. Respondents were more likely to perform a prophylactic Burch if it had been more than 6 years since they completed residency or fellowship training.
Response rate was 62.7%. Prevalence of VN was 12.8%; 72.1% reported only a little bother. Odds ratios for parity and solid stool were high.
Mean postoperative value (+/-SD) for pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POPQ) measurements Aa, Ap, and C were: -2.4 +/- 1.1 (cm), -2.4 +/- 0.9 (cm), and -7.7 +/- 1.2 (cm), respectively. The difference between preoperative and postoperative values of these points was significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Mesh erosion rate was 13/127 (10.2%) with significant correlation between mesh erosion and concurrent vaginal hysterectomy (p = 0.008). Combined anterior and posterior vaginal mesh surgery increased the risk of intraoperative bleeding and blood transfusion (p &lt; 0.05).
Under baseline assumptions, prophylactic antibiotics were favored in both models. In the true UTI model, prophylactic antibiotics had an 83.1% probability of no UTI or adverse events; 16.1% better than no prophylactic antibiotics.
The predominant epithelial types were squamous (41.9%), columnar (31.8%), combined squamous and columnar (18.2%), and cuboidal (13.6%). There was no case of the transitional type. Epithelial ulcerations were present in nine cases. The diverticular wall was composed only of fibrous collagen tissue in all cases. Inflammatory signs were noted in 77.3% of specimens.
Healing rate was 90.5% (19/21) and 95% (19/20), respectively after 12 months. The transobturatory group presented lesser complications rate than the retropubic group.
There were no significant differences in demographic data between the two groups. Caldesmon mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the vaginal tissue from women with anterior vaginal wall prolapse compared to women without prolapse [(caldesmon mean +/- SD mRNA expression in relative units) 0.03 +/- 0.03 vs 0.17 +/- 0.17, P = 0.02]. The fractional area of nonvascular caldesmon staining in the vagina of women with anterior vaginal wall prolapse was significantly decreased compared to women without prolapse [mean +/- SD (0.09 +/- 0.04 vs 0.16 +/- 0.09, P = 0.03)].
All MTX serum concentrations were less than 0.02 micromol/L within the 24-h period. This is 500 times below the recommended serum concentration for which folinic acid supplementation is recommended. There was also no significant increase in homocysteine level to suggest MTX toxicity. The only adverse effects were mild local dermal reactions in three female volunteers.
Although 32% patients had diabetes diagnosed before lung transplantation, 92% had random blood glucose levels &gt; or =11.1 mmol/L requiring insulin during admission. Patients with pre-existing diabetes had increased infection-related (3.9 vs 1.2, P= 0.01) and putative rejection-related (1.4 vs 0.5, P= 0.04) hospital admissions post-transplantation compared with those without diabetes pre-transplant. During the period of observation, four of eight patients with a prior diagnosis of diabetes died compared with none of 17 patients without prior diabetes (P= 0.0055).
Clinical indicators were developed for the following areas: venous thromboembolism, cognition, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, low trauma fracture, patient written care plans. The programme was well supported and incurred little burden to staff. Implementation occurred largely as planned; however, documentation of adherence to clinical indicators was variable. There was a generally positive trend over time, but for most indicators this was independent of the implementation process and may have been influenced by other system improvement activities. Failure to demonstrate a significant impact during the pilot phase is likely to have been influenced by administrative factors, especially lack of an integrative data documentation and collection process.
383 discrete indicators were identified from 22 source organizations or projects. Of these, 27.2% were relevant hospital-wide, 26.1% to surgical patients and 46.7% to non-surgical specialities, departments or diseases. Cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology and mental health were the specialities with greatest coverage, while nine clinical specialities had fewer than three specific indicators. Processes of care were measured by 54.0% of indicators and outcomes by 38.9%. Safety and effectiveness were the domains most frequently represented, with relatively few indicators measuring the other dimensions.
Inotropic support was used in a total of 50 patients (52%) at the separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Average age of the patients requiring inotropic support was 72.2 +/- 8.8 years. The study identified four significant, independent predictors of inotrope use: (1) Cardiac index [less than or equal to] 2.5 L/min/m2, (2) LVEDP [greater than or equal to] 20 mm Hg, (3) LVEF [less than or equal to] 40%, and (4) CKD stage 3 to 5.
Three hundred and three patients were included in this study, and the rate of GPD prescription was 48.5%. Most of the patients received H2-receptor antagonist, and, to a lesser degree, antacid and proton pump inhibitor. Patients with history of GI ulcer/bleeding were much more likely to be co-prescribed GPD than those who had no history of GI disorders (OR, 26.5). Compared with patients who were managed in general outpatient clinic, those managed in specialist clinic were more likely to receive GPD (OR, 3.04).
Among the 1,434 patients, the mean standard deviation of FPG was 162.8 +/- 60.5 mg/dL, HbA1c was 8.28 +/- 1.97%, and eAG was 190.9 +/- 56.6 mg/dL. Five Hb variants were detected in 11 patients, the incidence being 0.76%. Hb J was identified in 4 patients, Hb G in 2 patients, Hb E in 1 patient, Hb owari in 3 patients, and high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in 1 patient. Abnormal HPLC chromatograms were seen among the patients with Hb J, E, G and HbF, but not in the patients with Hb owari. In patients with Hb variants, FPG was 149.5 +/- 39.9 mg/dL, HbA1c was 7.29 +/- 2.01%, and eAG was 162.5 +/- 57.7 mg/dL. Lower values of eAG-FPG may have occurred in the patients with Hb J and E, and in those with high HbF. On scattergrams of the relationship between HbA1c and FPG, the plots of Hb J, E and high HbF lay below the regression line of non-Hb variants. Inconsistent Hb values between both methods were only observed among some samples of patients with Hb variants.
(1) The levels of primary electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, anion gap and osmotic pressure in AF was almost the same as in UCS and MS. (2) The levels of organic substances, including total protein, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and various enzymes, were markedly lower in AF than in UCS and MS, especially for total protein, which was 8- and 12.5-fold lower in AF than in UCS and MS, respectively. (3) The levels of tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, ferritin, cancer antigen 125 and 199, and alpha-fetoprotein in AF displayed different dynamic changes compared to UCS and MS as gestation advanced.
Only the acidic 0.5% and 1% SnF(2) and 1% AmF solutions were able to reduce erosive enamel loss significantly, while all other solutions and placebos did not differ significantly from the control. Between the acidic SnF(2) and the 1% AmF solutions no significant differences could be detected.
Inner enamel has lower elastic modulus and hardness but higher creep and stress redistribution abilities than outer counterpart, which is related to the gradual compositional change through the enamel.
For both 1-week and 1-year specimens, the values of L* with SCI were significantly higher than SCE for all shades of Sigma and XT; however, a* and b* were depended on brands and shades. Comparing 1-week and 1-year values, DeltaE*ab ranged 1.5 (A3 and B3)-2.9 (Inc) with SCI and 1.4 (A3)-2.9 (Inc) with SCE for Sigma, and 1.1 (A3D)-7.1 (Clear) with SCI and 1.4 (A3D)-7.6 (Clear) with SCE for XT. The values of DeltaE*ab with SCE were higher than those of SCI for all shades of XT; however, for Sigma, the differences varied with shades.
An acid-base resistant zone (ABRZ) was found adjacent to the hybrid layer in the outer lesion front with only Clearfil SE Bond and Clearfil Protect Bond, while Single Bond was devoid of this protective zone. Crystallite arrangement and the ultramorphology were almost similar in the corresponding regions of Clearfil SE Bond and Clearfil Protect Bond. However, thickness of the ABRZ at the mid portion was 1159(+/-41.91)nm in Clearfil protect Bond, which was significantly thicker than that of Clearfil SE Bond (F=514.84, p&lt;0.001). Selected area electron diffraction confirmed the crystallites in the zone as apatite.
High volumetric contraction was observed for Xeno IV and Xeno IV and Aurora mixture mainly related to solvent evaporation. A drying period favourably influenced the extent of photopolymerization of Xeno IV, which did not increase in the presence of Aurora.
Percentages of external "continuous margins" ranged from 97.9+-4.6 to 66.5+-7.8 before and from 87.4+-25.0 to 5.8+-12.5 after loading. Internal adaptation ranged from 96.4+-8.0 to 17.1+-20.4 after loading for the core adaptation and from 89.8+-12.2 to 65.9+-14.3 for the dentin-luting composite interface and from 99.4+-1.2 to 88.6+-9.4 for the composite-post interface.
The dual-curing materials showed average conversion percentages close to 64%, although onlays thickness clearly influence the degree of conversion, the light-curing composite showed satisfactory results only when onlays thickness was thin, however preheating significantly improved the performance of the light-curing composite under onlays of great thickness.
After an observation time up to 3 years, survival rate of IP-PCRs was 100% and 97% for PC-PCRs due to one severe fracture. The PC-PCR had to be replaced after 9 months. Secondary caries and endodontic complications did not occur. Increased clinical service time resulted in significant decrease of marginal adaptation (p=0.031) and enhanced marginal discoloration (p&lt;0.0001). Both PCR ceramic materials demonstrated significant deteriorations in color match (p&lt;0.0001) and surface roughness (p&lt;0.0001), IP-PCRs were significantly more affected (p&lt; or =0.005). Regarding anatomic form IP-PCRs performed significantly better (p=0.0012).
At every region, results did not show any statistical difference between the DC and LC techniques. With the LC technique bond strength values were lower at the apical region than those recorded at the coronal and middle regions. At the coronal and middle regions, bond strength values for the SADC technique were lower than those resulting when using the other two techniques. At the apical region, there was not significant difference in bond strength between the luting techniques tested.
CENP-H expression was higher in tongue cancer cell lines and cancer tissues (T) than that in normal cell and adjacent noncancerous tongue tissues (N), respectively. It was overexpressed in 55.95% (94/168) of the paraffin-embedded tongue cancer tissues, and there was a strong correlation between CENP-H expression and clinical stage, as well as T classification. CENP-H can predict the prognosis of tongue cancer patients especially those in early stage. Depletion of CENP-H can inhibit the proliferation of tongue cancer cells (Tca8113) and downregulate the expression of Survivin.
The majority (68%) of the patients who underwent ENBDC had complicated cholecystitis. Advanced technical expertise was not required for insertion of an ENBD. In retrospect, ENBDC was useful in prevention of a possible catastrophe in 69% of cases. Open conversion was necessary in five patients and biliary complications occurred in five patients only in the non-ENBD group. There were no procedure-related complications. One limitation of the study was that it was not randomized and there was no comparison with patients without ENBDC.
Patients were classified as B-C types I (n = 5), II (n = 21), IIIa (n = 23), IIIb (n = 5), and IV (n = 8). Preoperative single ENBD was effective in 46/62 patients (74%) including 5/5 (100%) B-C type I, 20/21 (94%) type II, 16/23 (70%) type IIIa, 4/5 (80%) type IIIb, and 1/8 (13%) type IV. Sixteen cases (26%) required additional drainages with ENBD or endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) in 8/16 (50%), and with PTBD in 8/16 (50%). Mild acute pancreatitis (n = 1, 2%), segmental cholangitis (n = 2, 3%), and acute cholangitis with catheter obstruction (n = 7, 11%) occurred with ENBD.
The lower the elastic ratio, the more advanced was the liver fibrosis stage. There was a significant correlation between the elastic ratio and the histological fibrosis stage. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve for the diagnosis of significant liver fibrosis using this device was superior to those conventionally determined by blood parameters.
A total of five laparoscopic left-colon, one right-colon, and one rectal resections were performed. Three patients underwent preoperative left-colon stenting and two received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patient with rectal cancer underwent neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Liver procedures included one bisegmentectomy (segments 2, 3), 3 segmentectomies, 6 metastasectomies, and four laparoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablations (LUG-RFAs). One patient with multiple liver metastases was managed by a two-stage hepatectomy partially conducted by a totally laparoscopic approach. The overall postoperative morbidity was null. The median hospital stay was 10 days (range 7-10 days).
The serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tissue levels of malondialdehyde were found to be significantly lower in EPO-administered groups when compared with the levels in groups without EPO treatment. The severity of pancreatic edema, acinar necrosis, inflammation, and perivascular infiltrate were reduced in all the EPO groups compared with the no-treatment groups.
Sixty of the 146 member institutions responded to the questionnaires. There were a total of 1,846 cases of resected pancreatic carcinoma between 2001 and 2005. The study population had a greater proportion of males, and a mean age of 65.3 years (range 34-90 years). The lesion was located in the head of the pancreas in 1,204 cases (71.7%), in the body in 353 cases (21.0%), and in the tail in 111 cases (6.6%). Overall survival rates were 67.3% at 1 year, 36.0% at 2 years, and 23.9% at 3 years, respectively. Adjuvant chemotherapy (usually involving gemcitabine) was used in 66.0% of cases. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy was found to improve the overall survival rate. Interestingly, adjuvant chemotherapy only improved survival in late-stage (UICC stages IIB, III, and IV) but not early stage (IA, IB, and IIA) patients. Survival was treatment duration-dependent, with patients who received more than 12 months of therapy having a 3-year survival rate of 51.2%.
Nine out of the 11 cases have survived from 3.7 years to 13.9 years (mean 7.3 years) and they are in good conditions at present. Seven patients were subjected to preoperative apheresis. Eight patients experienced acute rejection and of them, 6 experienced steroid-resistant rejection that was treated with deoxyspergualin and apheresis. One patient who suffered rapidly progressing rejection died due to liver failure. Three patients who were administered rituximab did not suffer severe rejection nor adverse effects. During the long-term follow up 5 recipients had major complications such as postoperative lymphoproliferative disease, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, portal vein occlusion and biliary stenosis. But those complications were controlled under stable conditions.
Perioperative data from patients with routine portal reconstruction were similar to those in the patients with conventional portal reconstruction and the patients without portal reconstruction. There were no postoperative complications directly related to portal reconstruction.
Hepatic micrometastases were present in around 48% of the liver metastases, accounting for 59% of the patients. The tumor recurrence rate in the remnant liver after hepatic resection was significantly higher, and survival significantly poorer, in patients with such micrometastases than in those without. Micrometastases tended to appear around the liver metastases that had reduced E-cadherin expression. Most of the micrometastases in the lymph ducts and sinusoids showed reduced E-cadherin expression. MMP-7 expression was not correlated with the presence of micrometastases.
Calcitonin gene-related peptide was found to have positive effects on healing of the anastomosis by inhibiting the effects of TNF-alpha and increasing the bursting pressure and hydroxyproline content of the anastomosis.
The population typical value (TV) of Cl (Cl (TV)) and TV of volume of distribution (Vd (TV)) were modeled as: Cl (TV) (mL/min) = 117 x age (year)(-0.119) x body weight (kg)(0.348) x total bilirubin (mg/dL)(-0.226) x albumin (g/dL)(0.327). Vd (TV) (L) = 0.415 x body weight (kg)(0.596) x albumin (g/dL)(-0.292). ICG concentration at zero time (C (0)) and 15 min (C (15)) for R (15) (C (15)/C (0) x 100) were derived from following equations. C (0) = dose/Vd (TV) and C (15) = C (0)e(-k t ) where t = 15 min and k = Cl (TV)/Vd (TV). [corrected] Median percent prediction error and absolute prediction error in the estimated values were 18.0% and 25.6% for Cl; 6.1% and 16.5% for k; and -7.0% and 33.1% for R (15).
Serum alpha-fetoprotein and curability were identified by multivariate analysis as the only significant prognostic factors. The discriminatory ability of the CLIP scoring system was superior to other systems. Patients with CLIP scores &lt;2 had better prognosis (score = 0, 100% of 1-year survival rate; score = 1, 75%) than those with scores &gt;2 (score = 2, 3 and 4; 50%, 46% and 33%, respectively).
All the undifferentiated carcinomas contained adenocarcinomatous and sarcomatous components, and two had a distinct glandular structure. However, we could not pathomorphologically confirm the continuity of the adenomatous with the sarcomatous components in any of the patients. Three undifferentiated carcinomas contained osteoclast-like giant cells. Pathological observation of the tumor and MPD was possible in three of the seven undifferentiated carcinomas. PanIN-3 was observed in the MPD of three patients, suggesting extension into the MPD. In one of these three, the tumor presented intraductal growth in the MPD, and preoperative pancreatic juice cytology revealed atypical cells with osteoclast-like giant cells. In the remaining two, the tumor extraductally compressed the MPD upward.
The plasma TM level was significantly higher in the rejection group than in the non-rejection group. TF expression was observed in SECs, in infiltrating inflammatory cells, and in the vascular endothelium in the rejection group. TF mRNA expression was significantly higher in the rejection group than in the non-rejection group.
Lymph vessels lined with D2-40 were visualized in the submucosal layer of the common bile duct in all cases. In 3 of 15 patients, clusters of cancer cells were identified in the submucosal lymph vessels of the extrahepatic bile duct, and this lymphatic invasion of cancer cells failed to be detected with only conventional hematoxylin-eosin staining. The frequency of the invasion to the submucosal lymph vessels in T2 GC correlated with presence of microscopic invasion to hepatoduodenal ligament and perineural invasion.
All 62 patients (who had been diagnosed with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma and were managed in our hospital) patients were treated with TAE, with a success rate of 91% (57/62). Early mortality (within 30 days after rupture) was 38%. Factors that were associated with early mortality were old age, low hemoglobin at presentation, elevated bilirubin at presentation, prolonged prothrombin time at presentation (INR &gt; 1.3), low albumin level at presentation, and unsuccessful embolization. A low albumin level was the only independent risk factor for early mortality. The overall median survival time was 39 days. Surgical resections were possible in seven patients. Their cumulative survival was significantly longer (P = 0.002) than that of patients managed with non-operative treatment after embolization.
In Cohort A, application of the maneuver was successful in demonstrating bleeders under low CVP levels. Cohort A had lower rate of massive bleeding requiring emergency reoperation (2.3 vs 5.8%, P = 0.049), less postoperative blood transfusions (13 vs 24%, P = 0.042), lower morbidity (20 vs 35%, P &lt; 0.045) and shorter hospital stay compared to Cohort B.
With respect to operative method, laparoscopic hepatectomy involving either partial hepatectomy or left lateral sectionectomy is a less invasive procedure in patients with cirrhosis than conventional hepatectomy. Among our laparoscopic hepatectomy cases, operative time was shorter and bleeding was less in recent, as compared to earlier, cases. Furthermore, laparoscopic hepatectomy was less invasive than conventional hepatectomy, as determined by the E-PASS scoring system. Patients also recovered more quickly, which resulted in shorter hospital stays even for patients with cirrhosis. Both the 5-year survival rate and the rate of survival without recurrence of HCC were nearly identical to those of open conventional hepatectomy.
We have performed 105 laparoscopic partial liver resections, 26 laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomies, and 45 laparoscopy-assisted major hepatectomies. A total of 176 patients underwent minimally invasive liver resections.
Laparoscopic hepatectomy was performed in 471 patients by means of nonanatomical partial resection (57.7%), left lateral sectionectomy (24.6%), hemihepatectomy (12.5%), sectionectomy other than lateral sectionectomy (2.5%), and segmentectomy (2.5%). Hepatectomy was performed by a totally laparoscopic procedure in 47% of the patients and by a hybrid procedure in 53%. The rate of complications was 12.3%; there was no case of serious liver failure or operative mortality. Endoscopic ablation therapy was performed in 169 patients through a thoracoscopic (25.4%) or laparoscopic approach (74.6%), using radiowaves (55.6%), microwaves (40.2%), cryotherapy (1.8%), or ethanol (0.6%). The incidence of complications was 6.6%.
In this review the conversion rate was &lt;4%, the histological positive margins was &lt;0.8%, and the mortality was inferior to 0.8%.
Indications for laparoscopic hepatectomy do not differ from those for open surgery. Technical feasibility is the only limiting factor. Bleeding is the major intraoperative concern, but, if managed by an expert surgeon, do not worsen outcomes. Hand assistance can be useful in selected cases to avoid conversion. Patient selection must take both tumor location and size into consideration. Potentially good candidates are patients with peripheral lesions requiring limited hepatectomy or left lateral sectionectomy; their outcomes, including reduced blood loss, morbidity, and hospital stay, are better than those of their laparotomic counterparts. The same advantages have been observed in cirrhotics. Laparoscopic major hepatectomies and resections of postero-superior segments need further evaluation. The results of LLR in cancer patients seem to be similar to those obtained with the laparotomic approach, especially in cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, but further analysis is required.
Quartile 1 had a mean LR of -6.8 +/- 2.3 degrees ; quartile 4 showed a mean LR of 2.3 +/- 1.6 degrees . A depressed peak velocity of lateral wall, when compared with the septum, was found for quartile 1 (p = 0.01), whereas the converse was noted in quartile 4 (p = 0.0001). The difference in amplitude of peak velocity between septal and lateral walls was found to correlate with the pattern of LR and with percentage reduction in LV ESV at follow-up in nonischemic patients. Septal-lateral delay was not correlated with the presence of LR, nor was it predictive of reduction in LV ESV.
Energy loss index decreased (0.85 cm(2)/m(2) vs. 0.77 and 0.75 cm(2)/m(2)) and the prevalence of low stress-corrected midwall shortening increased (10% vs. 26% and 63%) with increasing LV global load (all p &lt; 0.001). The EF was low in only 2% of patients. Patients with low-flow AS had higher LV global load and more often low midwall shortening than those with normal-flow AS (9.66 +/- 2.23 mm Hg/ml.m(2.04) and 77%, vs. 6.38 +/- 2.04 mm Hg/ml.m(2.04) and 30%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, LV global load was a main predictor of low stress-corrected midwall shortening independent of male sex, concentric LV geometry, LV hypertrophy (all p &lt; 0.001), concomitant hypertension, and aortic regurgitation.
During a median follow-up of 18 months (interquartile range 14 to 25 months), the overall rates of severe and all cardiac events were 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. In 802 patients without obstructive CAD, there were 4 cardiac events, of which 1 was severe, whereas in 348 patients with obstructive CAD, there were 17 cardiac events, of which 5 were severe. The difference between the 2 groups was highly significant both for severe events (odds ratio: 17.3, 95% confidence interval: 3.6 to 82.5) and for all cardiac events (odds ratio: 16.1, 95% confidence interval: 7.2 to 36.0; both p &lt; 0.001). The rate of all cardiac events in patients without obstructive CAD was significantly lower than predicted by the Framingham risk score (p = 0.01).
Infarct volume measurements obtained by both methods were strongly correlated (R = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001) and in good agreement (mean difference: -0.46 ml +/- 4.00%). Compared with retrospective ECG gating, estimated radiation dosages were markedly reduced with prospective ECG gating (930.1 +/- 62.2 mGy x cm vs. 42.4 +/- 2.3 mGy x cm, p &lt; 0.001). The SNR and CNR of infarcted myocardium were somewhat lower for prospective gated images (22.0 +/- 11.0 vs. 16.3 +/- 7.8 and 8.8 +/- 5.3 vs. 7.0 +/- 3.9, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). However, all examinations using prospective gating protocol achieved sufficient diagnostic image quality for the assessment of MI.
After the follow-up period of 30 +/- 8 months, 9 patients with perfusion deficit (PD) suffered from MACE, whereas no MACE occurred among the 36 patients without PD (p = 0.014). Among patients who had MACE, the number of ischemic segments (2.3 +/- 1.6 vs. 1.4 +/- 1.6, p = 0.0025) was significantly higher, whereas the number of delayed enhancement segments did not differ (1.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 1.6 +/- 2.3, p = 0.4). Target vessel revascularization was required in 38% of patients with PD and 6% of patients without PD (p = 0.005). In addition, the percentage of freedom from AP and dyspnea at the follow-up after 18 +/- 8 months was significantly lower among patients without perfusion deficit (69.4% vs. 15.6%; p = 0.0001). After a follow-up period of 30 +/- 8 months, the rate of AP (11.1% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.33) as well as the percentage of patients free of symptoms was similar in both groups (77.8% vs. 88.9%, p = 0.82).
The prevalence of patients with significant stenosis was 63% (69% functionally 1-vessel, 28% 2-vessel, and 3% 3-vessel disease). Sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 90%, respectively, on a patient basis, and 71% and 89% on a vessel territory basis. Sensitivity, if only areas supplied by grafts (n = 196) were evaluated, was 78% and specificity was 94%, compared with territories supplied by ungrafted native vessels (n = 51) with sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 91%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the 53 areas with prior infarction were 88% and 79%, respectively.
In the 3 groups, DC was 5.2 (interquartile range 3.5 to 7.1) ms, 5.7 (4.1 to 7.3) ms, and 6.4 (5.0 to 8.0) ms, whereas TS was 5.3 (2.6 to 8.4) ms/R-R interval, 6.9 (3.2 to 11.7) ms/R-R interval, and 7.8 (4.1 to 13.2) ms/R-R interval, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 for both). After adjustment for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), initial perfusion defect, creatine kinase, age, diabetes mellitus, sex, and medical therapy, patients with salvage index &lt;30% had a 2.6-fold risk (95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 3.9, p &lt; 0.001) of having abnormal DC (&lt; or =4.5 ms) or TS (&lt; or =2.5 ms/R-R interval) compared with patients with salvage index &gt; or =60%. However, patients who had autonomic dysfunction defined by abnormal DC and TS had a poor prognosis independent of whether or not the salvage index was &lt;30% (5-year mortality rates of 16.5% and 17.3%, respectively). In contrast, prognosis was excellent when both factors were normal (5-year mortality rates of 2.9% and 4.0%, respectively). Predictive value of impaired LVEF (&lt; or =40%) was also independent of salvage index. Multivariably, both autonomic dysfunction and impaired LVEF were independent predictors of 5-year mortality.
The absolute and percent necrotic core volumes were significantly greater in Group I than in Group II (13.6 +/- 6.4 mm(3) vs. 7.9 +/- 4.4 mm(3), p &lt; 0.001, and 19.8 +/- 10.4% vs. 12.8 +/- 8.4%, p = 0.015, respectively). The absolute and percent necrotic core areas were significantly greater in Group I than in Group II at the minimum lumen site (1.70 +/- 0.91 mm(2) vs. 0.61 +/- 0.39 mm(2), p &lt; 0.001, and 22.9 +/- 11.7% vs. 10.4 +/- 6.6%, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and at the largest necrotic core site (2.00 +/- 0.86 mm(2) vs. 0.81 +/- 0.78 mm(2), p &lt; 0.001, and 24.0 +/- 11.7% vs. 12.9 +/- 6.6%, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The DeltacTnI correlated with: 1) absolute and percent necrotic core area at the minimum lumen site and at the largest necrotic core site; 2) absolute necrotic core volume; 3) percent fibrofatty area at the minimum lumen site; and 4) lesion site plaque burden. In the multivariate analysis, absolute necrotic core area at the minimum lumen site was the only independent predictor of post-PCI cTnI elevation &gt; or =3x the upper limit of normal (odds ratio: 1.318; 95% confidence interval: 1.090 to 1.594, p = 0.004).
Twenty-seven FA (26.2%) and 18 TCFA (17.4%) were found out of the 103 lesions studied. Overall the percentage of necrotic core decreases from proximal to distal rim (16.8% vs. 13.5% respectively, p = 0.01), whereas the cap thickness showed an inverse tendency (130 +/- 105 microm vs. 151 +/- 68 microm for proximal and distal rim, respectively, p = 0.05). The thin caps were more often located in the proximal rim (15 of 34, 44.1%), followed by the in-bifurcation segment (14 of 34, 41.2%), and were less frequent in the distal rim (5 of 34, 14.7%).
A statistically significant difference appeared in syndecan-1 expression between benign (mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms) and mucinous carcinomas, but there was no significant difference in tenascin immunoexpression between these tumor groups.
A total of 101 patients had anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (2.6% of all ERCP). Only 2 patients (2.0% of all anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction cases and 0.05% of all ERCP examinations) had type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction. Both cases were associated with choledochal cysts and chronic pancreatitis.
Six studies, including 146,517 individuals with 1,671 cases of pancreatitis, met the inclusion criteria. We found a monotonic and approximately exponential dose-response relationship between average volume of alcohol consumption and pancreatitis. However, in a categorical analysis the lower drinking categories were not significantly elevated, with an apparent threshold of 4 drinks daily.
Of the 537 patients who underwent allo-HSCT, 45 recipients were positive for HBsAg prior to transplantation. Of these 45 patients, 21 were transplanted from anti-HBs-positive donors and the remaining 24 were transplanted from anti-HBs-negative donors. In the former cases, seroconversion was noted in 4 of the 21 patients (19%). In the latter cases, however, no seroconversion was noted following the transplantation. Thirty patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs were transplanted from anti-HBs-positive donors, and 15 out of 30 patients (50%) acquired anti-HBs. Four hundred and seven patients who were positive for anti-HBs were transplanted from anti-HBs-positive or HbsAg-negative donors; 8 of these proved HBsAg-positive following the transplantation. There were no changes in HBV serological markers following transplantation in 41 patients who were transplanted from HbsAg-positive donors.
An amplicon was found in 377 specimens and genotype C occupied 98.1% (370 cases); none of the other genotypes were found. A mixed pattern of genotypes B and C was seen in seven specimens (1.9%), of which five were tested using PCR targeting the X fragment; no genotype B bands were found. With the exception of 1 case, which was subgenotype A2, whole sequences of Korean HBV strains (n=62) belonged to subgenotype C2.
Transarterial embolization was performed in 56 cases (90.3%) to control bleeding, with a hemostasis success rate of 89.3%. The survival time after the rupture of HCC was 8.0+/-1.7 months (mean+/-SD), although it was longer in HCC cases that were first diagnosed in a ruptured state or ruptured with a small amount of bleeding than in those that ruptured during follow-up after diagnosis or with a large amount of bleeding, respectively. The 30-day mortality rate in patients with a ruptured HCC was 43.5%, and the early deaths were independently associated with the presence of hepatic encephalopathy (odds ratio, OR=44.7; 95% confidence interval, CI=1.9-1051.1; P=0.018), serum bilirubin &gt;3.0 mg/dL (OR=36.7; 95% CI=1.3-1068.5; P=0.036), and the massive or diffuse type of tumor morphology (OR=53.5; 95% CI=3.0-964.2; P=0.007).
Four patients had primary hepatic tuberculosis, and eight patients had hepatic tuberculosis secondary to pulmonary or miliary tuberculosis. Three patients were immunocompromised, and six patients had no previous medical problem. An elevated serum level of alkaline phosphatase was the most frequently observed finding in laboratory tests. Imaging studies showed variable findings, including hepatosplenomegaly, multiple hepatic nodules, abscess formation, and even normal findings. Ten patients responded to antituberculosis drugs, and two cases with tuberculous liver abscess had persistent disease despite prolonged therapy.
HBsAg disappeared in 13 of the 49 (26.5%) patients who experienced lamivudine-induced HBeAg seroconversion; HBsAg did not reappear during follow-up period (1-86 months). The time that elapsed between initiation of lamivudine treatment and total HBsAg clearance was 25.9+/-27.1 months (mean+/-SD; range: 5-104 months). The age at which treatment was initiated was the only factor associated with HBsAg clearance. Children who were cleared of HBsAg were significantly younger than those who were not (5.1+/-4.3 years vs. 7.9+/-4.9 years, respectively; P=0.006). All 13 of these patients eventually produced antibodies to HBsAg.
After 1 year of therapy, 75.0% and 51.9% of groups A and B, respectively, had HBV DNA levels of &lt;2,000 copies/mL (P=0.032), and HBeAg seroconversion rates were 16.9% and 16.7%, respectively. The rates of viral breakthrough at 1 year were 10.0% (8/80) and 44.4% (12/27), respectively (P&lt;0.001). Proven sites of mutation of HBV DNA polymerase in naive patients were, for example, L80I, L180M, A181V/T, M204I and V207I. Ten patients complained of prominent fatigue and revealed elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Two of these patients presented with severe myopathy from which they recovered completely after quitting clevudine.
N-cadherin expression was upregulated in human HSC during activation in culture. Addition of function-blocking antibodies or a peptide targeting the extracellular domain of N-cadherin, to cultured HSC, promoted apoptosis. During apoptosis, there was cleavage of N-cadherin into 20-100 kDa fragments. MMP-2 became activated early during HSC apoptosis and directly cleaved N-cadherin in vitro. Addition of activated MMP-2 to HSCs in culture resulted in enhanced apoptosis and loss of N-cadherin.
A sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 91 of the 125 patients treated (72.8%). Patients with chronic psychotic disorders or former IDUs had SVR rates similar to other groups. After multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with treatment failure were liver cirrhosis [odds ratio (OR) 3.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-10.4], a history of depression and not being on antidepressants at the commencement of HCV treatment (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.2-16) and active IDUs (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.77-30.4).
Biliverdin was present in plasma and urine. In nucleotide 52 of exon I of the DNA isolated from the hyperbiliverdinaemic patient, we discovered a novel heterozygous C--&gt;T nonsense mutation converting an arginine (CGA) in position 18 into a stop codon (TGA) (R18Stop) predicted to truncate the protein N-terminally to the active site Tyr97. Two children of the proband were heterozygous for the identical mutation in the BVR-A gene, but had no clinical signs of liver disease and had normal levels of biliverdin. The BVR-A gene mutation was not found in 200 healthy volunteers or nine patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis.
Of 976 autopsies in the 10-year period, 254 had DM, and 159 met criteria for inclusion. Nineteen cases (12%) met criteria of DHS. In contrast to the findings in the recently published series of 14 clinically indicated biopsies, the affected autopsy patients were more often men than women (14:5), were older (mean age 56.4 vs 45.8 years), and had less commonly recorded retinopathy and elevated alkaline phosphatase (16 and 32% vs 42 and 83%), respectively, but diabetic nephropathy was equally common (89 vs 83%). Compared with an age- and gender-matched group of autopsied diabetic patients without DHS, the DHS group had a significantly higher percentage of diabetic nephropathy (89 vs 47%, P&lt;0.05); no other statistically significant clinical differences were found between these two groups.
GPC3 immunoreactivity was observed in 76.7% of the HCC specimens. No significant differences were observed in the number of rMvarphi marker-positive cells among the three expression patterns. In contrast, the GPC3+/C pattern showed a significantly higher number of pMvarphi-positive cells compared with the other two patterns, most of which tended to take on the morphology of migrating macrophages. A second experiment conducted to compare macrophage infiltration between the xenograft tissues of a GPC3-transfected HCC cell line and its parent GPC3-nonexpressing cell line revealed that the increase in macrophages was stimulated by membrane expression of GPC3.
Cryoglobulins were detected in 18 of 119 patients (15.1%) included in this study. They were detected in 12 of 45 hepatitis C (26.7%) and six of 74 coinfected patients (8.1%), which was statistically significant, P=0.01. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were also found to be significantly lower in the CG-positive group compared with the CG-negative group, P=&lt;0.01. CGs were detected in seven of 21 (33.3%) and in 11 of 98 (11.2%) hepatitis C female and male patients, respectively, indicating a significantly positive association with the female gender, P=0.02. A logistic regression adjusted for gender, AST and ALT showed that hepatitis C patients without schistosomal coinfection are more likely to have cryoglobulinaemia, odds ratio=4.12, 95% confidence interval=1.42-11.95.
At initial evaluation, prevalence of TD in PBC was 13% compared with 11% in PSC (P=0.71) and 25% in NAFLD (P=0.08). Incidence of TD was 2.9 patients per 100 person-years in PBC compared with 2.1 patients per 100 person-years in PSC (P=0.57) and 1.8 patients per 100 person-years in non-alcoholic liver disease (P=0.45). Older age, female gender, biochemical abnormalities and concurrent autoimmune disorders were not predictive of the development of TD.
Higher expression of ET(A) and ET(B) was observed in malignant compared with normal cholangiocytes. ET-1 inhibited proliferation and VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 expression of Mz-ChA-1 cells. Chronic ET-1 treatment decreased tumour volume, tumour cell proliferation and VEGF-A and VEGF-C expression but increased apoptosis and collagen tissue deposition compared with controls.
LR in UTI (-/-) mice was delayed at 36 h after hepatectomy, at which time the DNA profile was different. One hundred and fourteen genes were upregulated and 100 genes were downregulated in UTI (-/-) mice at 36 h after hepatectomy among the 21, 977 mRNAs examined. Furthermore, serum IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1beta levels at 36 h after hepatectomy in the UTI (-/-) mice were significantly higher than in the UTI (+/+) mice.
There was no survival difference at 180 days post-OLT between groups. After transplantation, patients with either hyponatraemia at OLT or resolved hyponatraemia had longer time until discharge alive and had higher rates of delirium, acute renal failure, acute cellular rejection and infection than those who were never hyponatraemic. As compared with patients with hyponatraemia at OLT, those with resolved hyponatraemia were more likely to be discharged alive within 3 weeks, but other outcomes, including survival, did not differ significantly.
Patients with chronic hepatitis C have a higher HOMA-IR, TNF-alpha, IL-6, adiponectin and IL-10, as compared with controls. By multiple linear regression analysis, moderate/severe steatosis grade, total cholesterol level and adiponectin was significantly associated with HOMA-IR, whereas, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 was not. Male gender, BMI and HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with the serum adiponectin level. Serum adiponectin was positively correlated with TNF-alpha level, which was significantly associated with higher degree of hepatic necroinflammation.
We investigated 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ATGR1 gene, among which rs3772622 showed the lowest P-value of allele frequency model (P=0.0000012) with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.95 (1.49-2.55). Five SNPs (rs3772622, rs3772633, rs2276736, rs3772630 and rs3772627) were significantly associated with NAFLD, even when the most conservative Bonferroni's correction was applied. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that SNP rs3772622 and another four SNPs (rs3772633, rs2276736, rs3772630 and rs3772627) were in the same block. We investigated the association between rs3772622 genotypes and the fibrosis index. The results of the analysis revealed an additive increase of the fibrosis index in the patients with the A allele of rs3772622.
Exposure of primary mouse hepatocytes to 1% oxygen stimulated nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha and upregulated PAI-1, vascular endothelial cell growth factor and the vasoactive peptides adrenomedullin-1 (ADM-1) and ADM-2. In contrast, the levels of PDGF-A and PDGF-B mRNAs were unaffected in these cells by hypoxia. Exposure of HIF-1alpha-deficient hepatocytes to 1% oxygen only partially prevented upregulation of these genes, suggesting that other hypoxia-regulated transcription factors, such as HIF-2alpha, may also regulate these genes. In support of this, HIF-2alpha was activated in hypoxic hepatocytes, and exposure of HIF-1beta-deficient hepatocytes to 1% oxygen completely prevented upregulation of PAI-1, vascular endothelial cell growth factor and ADM-1, suggesting that HIF-2alpha may also contribute to upregulation of these genes in hypoxic hepatocytes.
Patients who underwent the two different kinds of TIPS were balanced during recruitment for this study. The incidences of overall encephalopathy and de novo encephalopathy in the TIPS-LBPV group were significantly lower than that of the TIPS-RBPV group during follow-up (P=0.036 and 0.012 respectively). The incidences of rebleeding or re-intervention and improvement of ascites were similar between groups (P&gt;0.05). Patients undergoing TIPS-RBPV required more rehospitalization and incurred more costs than those who underwent TIPS-LBPV (P=0.030 and 0.039 respectively). There was no significant difference between the two groups in survival based on a survival curve constructed according to the Kaplan-Meier method (P&gt;0.05).
MCDHF feeding induced marked steatohepatitis with macrophage infiltration. Tel attenuated liver steatosis with decreased hepatic triglycerides (P&lt;0.05) and fibrogenesis with decreased type I collagen and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA expressions (P&lt;0.05). Tel also suppressed the infiltration of macrophages into the liver and decreased hepatic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and its receptor (CC-chemokine receptor 2; CCR2) mRNA expressions, especially CCR2. In vitro, Tel suppressed CCR2 expression, which was induced by low-density lipoprotein. The size of adipocyte in visceral fat tissue was reduced with an increased serum adiponectin concentration in the Tel group.
At macroscopic examination, the liver of DMN-treated Smad3 WT appeared harder with a dark brown colouring and necrotic areas compared with that from null mice. Histological and morphometric evaluation revealed a significantly higher degree of hepatic fibrosis and accumulation of connective tissue in the Smad3 WT compared with null mice. IHC evaluation showed a marked increase in alpha-SMA, CTGF, collagen I-III, TGF-beta and Smad3 staining in the liver of Smad3 WT compared with that in null mice, whereas Smad7 was increased only in null mice.
There was no change in the HVPG or intestinal permeability from baseline to study end but there was a trend to reduction in plasma endotoxin (P=0.09), a mild but significant increase in serum TNF-alpha (P=0.02) and a significant reduction in plasma aldosterone (P=0.03).
Human HGF and VEGF expressions were detected only in the liver of HGF/VEGF dogs at day 2 after injection but declined at sacrifice (day 7). No expression was detected in the liver of the lacZ or PBS groups. Plasma levels of HGF and VEGF were not statistically different from those in the lacZ group (P=0.81, P=0.22 respectively). The PCNA labelling index was five-fold higher in the HGF/VEGF group compared with the lacZ group (P&lt;0.01). No immunostaining was detected in the PBS group. Transaminases were only elevated (P&lt;0.01) in the lacZ group compared with the other groups.
While overall net ownership in the sample is low, the evidence fails to suggest that poorer households are less likely to own bed nets, when controlling for covariates, nor does the likelihood of receiving a free net depend on socioeconomic status (SES). Formal schooling and market knowledge seem to indicate higher average willingness to pay, while use of alternate methods for malaria prevention, and receipt of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) are found to decrease demand for bed nets.
There were 414 patients who presented to hospital EDs as a result of the bushfires. Patients were triaged at the emergency scene, at treatment centres and in hospital. National and statewide burns disaster plans were activated. Twenty-two patients with burns presented to the state's burns referral centres, of whom 18 were adults. Adult burns patients at The Alfred spent 48.7 hours in theatre in the first 72 hours. There were a further 390 bushfire-related ED presentations across the state in the first 72 hours. Most patients with serious burns were triaged to and managed at burns referral centres. Throughout the disaster, burns referral centres continued to have substantial surge capacity.
Seventy-four hospitals (55%) responded: 47 (64%) reported access to a stroke unit, and 19 (26%) to a specialist clinic for TIA. Initial assessment included blood tests, electrocardiogram and brain computed tomography at most sites (92%-94%), and carotid imaging at more than half (65%), but magnetic resonance imaging at only 3% of sites. A tool to stratify the risk of subsequent stroke was used at 38 sites (51%), more commonly in hospitals with a stroke unit than in those without such a unit (64% v 30%; P = 0.005). Treatment was initiated at the initial assessment at 42 sites (58%), more commonly at stroke unit than non-stroke unit sites (68% v 37%; P = 0.007). Formalised policies for management of TIA patients were used at 38 sites (54%), with clear differences between sites with a stroke unit and those without (70% v 25%; P &lt; 0.001).
Of 140 samples tested, results for RHD status were assigned for 135, and all 135 predictions were correct. A result was not assigned in five cases: three did not meet strict threshold criteria for classification, and two were due to RHD variants. Fetal SRY status was correctly predicted in 137 of 140 cases. In 16 samples typed both RHD- and SRY-negative, a positive RASSF1A result verified the presence of fetal DNA.
The results demonstrate that TRPV1 activation increases TNFR1 receptors and ROS generation in primary cultures of mouse DRG neurons. Activated increases in TNFR1 receptors and ROS production are absent in TRPV1 deficient mice. The PBN blocks increases in TNFR1 and ROS production induced by capsaicin/resiniferatoxin.
In multivariate analyses both IGF-I and the GH response in the ITT were significantly influenced by age, whereas the GH response in the GHRH/GHRP-6 test was significantly affected by BMI. There was no sex difference in IGF-I and in the GHRH/GHRP-6 test, but in the ITT males had a higher GH peak. There was a significant correlation between the GH responses in both tests, and the GH response was significantly higher in the GHRH/GHRP-6 test than in the ITT. Age-adjusted reference values were established for each test.
There were 212 incident cases of colorectal cancer during follow-up. A reduced risk of colorectal cancer was observed in individuals who used NSAIDs for more than a year (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.71), and in carriers of an CYP2C9 variant allele associated with lower enzymatic activity (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96). The combination of both determinants was associated with a further risk reduction but without synergy.
All patients with SM were positive for CD2 and/or CD25. All patients without SM , except one, were negative for these markers. The sensitivity for immunophenotyping was 100%, the specificity 91%. The positive and negative predictive values were 97% and 100% respectively.
We received 49 questionnaires from treating HCV specialists. The majority (65%) of respondents treat HCV patients during regular outpatient clinics, while 35% treat these patients in a separate setting dedicated to the care of HCV patients. The majority of physicians follow the stipulated dosage regimens of pegylated interferon (88%) and ribavirin (83%). A minority (13%) exceed the advised dosage of ribavirin. Side effects such as neutropenia are mostly managed by decreasing the interferon dosage (42%). Some 35% of physicians reduce ribavirin if haemoglobin levels drop below 5.4 mmol/l, and 41% initiate erythropoietin treatment.
Colorectal cancer was detected in significantly earlier stages in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients patients (p&lt;0.0001). Average stage specific predicted five-year survival was 59.1% in symptomatic and 76.6% in asymptomatic patients. Compared with the symptomatic patients the stage distribution for colorectal cancer patients detected with Hemoccult-II was not significantly different(p=0.29), whereas colorectal cancer was detected at significantly earlier stages with the OCSensor (p&lt;0.0001).Treatment could be confined to colonoscopy in 27% of the asymptomatic patients compared with 3% of the symptomatic patients (p&lt;0.0001). Cancer distribution over the colon was comparable between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p=0.3).
A [Na] increase of &gt;or=6 meq/l was reached in 19/22 (86%) patients, with an average time to goal of 13.1 h. No patients experienced a rapid overcorrection of [Na]. Five patients had an infusion site reaction necessitating an IV change. One patient experienced hypotension and another complained of thirst during infusion. Conivaptan was initiated in 11/22 patients (50%) who were hyponatremic despite already being on conventional therapies.
A total of 25 doses given to 19 patients were included (out of 44 total doses administered in the study period). Sodium rose by 5.8 +/- 3.2 mEq/l within 12 h, with 71% rising by at least 4 mEq/l and 52% manifesting at least a 6 mEq/l increase. In those receiving only a single dose, 69% maintained at least a 4 mEq/l rise up to 72 h. Conivaptan also consistently led to increased urine output and a significant drop in urine specific gravity (i.e., aquaresis). No cases of phlebitis were observed despite administration of conivaptan through peripheral IVs.
Fifty-one patients were identified (26 males; mean (SD) age, 58.2 (19.8) years). Most patients (65%) did not receive a loading dose; the most common loading dose was 1,500 mg (50% of 18 patients). The most common maintenance dose was 500 mg twice daily (59% of 51 patients), and average duration of therapy was 13.6 (12.7) days. Approximately 47% of patients had preexisting liver disease, and 25% had elevated serum creatinine. Twenty-two patients received LVM therapy for seizure prophylaxis; 29 for acute seizure treatment. Ninety-three percent of patients treated with LVM for acute seizure had no subsequent seizures; the remaining patients (7%) required additional AEDs. One patient receiving LVM for seizure prophylaxis had documented seizures requiring additional AEDs. No adverse hemodynamic events or cardiac arrhythmias were reported.
Patients in the BIS-augmentation group received significantly less propofol by volume (93.5 ml vs. 157.8 ml, respectively; P &lt; .015), and had lower infusion rates (14.6 vs. 27.9 mcg/kg/min; P = .003). There is a lower risk of propofol infusion exceeding manufacturer's recommended dosing guides in the BIS-augmentation group versus the Ramsay-alone group (0 vs. 23%, P = .0052). The BIS-augmentation group woke up much quicker than those in the Ramsay-alone group (1.2 vs. 7.5 min; P &lt; .0001).
Among 89 patients, 15 had withdrawal of life support, 5 had BD, 2 died from cardiac arrest, and 3 died from other causes. Among patients who died, ICH score, age, Glasgow Coma Scale, NIH Stroke Scale, and proximate cause were not associated with the proximate mechanism of death. The time to death was different (P &lt; 0.001) depending on the proximate mechanism. Patients with BD died 1 [0-1] 1 day after ICH, withdrawal of life support led to death 5 [1-13] days after ICH, cardiac death occurred 35 [35-85] days after ICH, and other causes led to death 33 [26-33] days after ICH. Among patients where life support was withdrawn, a higher ICH score on admission was related to earlier death (P = 0.002).
A total of 12,767 admissions with primary diagnosis of ICH were identified. Nicardipine was administered in 926 patients (7.3%) and nitroprusside was administered in 530 (4.3%) patients. There was no difference in baseline disease severity or risk of mortality among patients who were administered nicardipine or nitroprusside. After adjustment for baseline risk of mortality, the risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3-2.2) was higher among patients treated with nitroprusside compared with nicardipine. The risk of in-hospital mortality was also higher after adjustment for baseline risk of mortality and hospital characteristics in patients treated with nitroprusside (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1). After exclusion of patients who died during hospitalization, there was no difference in length of stay and total hospital cost in the multivariate analysis.
The overall incidence of symptomatic VTE was 3.8% (n = 1195). The incidence of VTE was 6.7% in SAH patients (n = 179), 2.9% in ICH patients (n = 516), and 3.8% in TBI patients (n = 500). The most commonly identified risk factors in the three groups were: greater than 40 years of age, immobility due to paresis or restrictions for mechanical ventilation, presumed infection, and presence of indwelling central venous catheter. There was no objective evidence of intracranial bleeding associated with pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in VTE patients.
Continuous hemofiltration was initiated for IH refractory to medical therapy. Within hours of initiation increase, ICP improved and normalized. Hemofiltration was safely discontinued after 48 h. Modified Rankin Score was 2 at 90 days.
Seven patients (median NIHSS = 16) were randomized to IV (N = 4) or IA (N = 3) TPA. There were no significant differences in the presentation NIHSS, time to presentation, or time to treatment between the two groups. Hemorrhage was noted in one patient in the IA group (asymptomatic) and one patient in the IV group (symptomatic). Recanalization was seen in all patients treated with IA TPA and none treated with IV TPA (P = 0.03, Fisher's Exact test).
Ninety-four patients with angiographically negative SAH were identified. A total of 31 patients were considered to have the perimesencephalic (p-SAH) subtype, while 63 patients fit criteria for the diffuse (d-SAH) subtype. Compared to the p-SAH subtype, those patients with d-SAH subtype had significantly higher risk for complications related to SAH with an increased incidence of hydrocephalus (50.8% vs. 9.6%), requirement for external ventricular drainage (41% vs. 9.6%), and for the hydrocephalus requiring eventual permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion (20.6% vs. 0%). Patients with d-SAH were also at an increased risk for symptomatic vasospasm (28.6% vs. 9.6%). Ultimately, only 76% of d-SAH patients achieved complete recovery and independent living, compared to 96.7% of p-SAH patients.
A 38-year-old female suffered acute onset of a left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) syndrome with an NIH stroke score of 11 approximately ten minutes after lower extremity sclerotherapy. CT angiogram demonstrated LMCA intraarterial air. Patient fully recovered after hyperbaric oxygen treatment with complete resolution of intraarterial air. However, thrombus replaced intraarterial air despite anticoagulation with heparin.
Excluding patients who were previously on AEDs, the primary analysis included 295 patients. The median ICH volume at admission was 14.9 (interquartile range, IQR 7.9-32.7) ml and the mean was 23.3 (+/-SD 22.8) ml. Seizures occurred in 5 patients (1.7%) after enrollment and 82 patients (28%) had a poor outcome at day 90. AEDs were initiated on 23 patients (8%) without documented seizure during the first 10 days of the trial. In logistic regression, initiation of AEDs was robustly associated with poor outcome (OR 6.8; 95% CI: 2.2-21.2, P = 0.001) after adjustment for other known predictors of outcome after ICH (age, initial hematoma volume, presence of intraventricular blood, initial Glasgow coma score, and prior warfarin use).
Mean (+/-SD) or median [range] demographics did not differ between groups [total N = 42 (6 female, 36 male, age 36.4 +/- 14.8 years and initial GCS 7 [3-8], median and range]. Fever burden in the first 3 days (time &gt;38 degrees C) in the induced normothermia versus control group was significantly less at 1.6% versus 10.6%, respectively (P = 0.03). Mean ICP for patients with induced normothermia versus control was 12.74 +/- 4.0 and 16.37 +/- 6.9 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, percentage of time with ICP &gt; 25 mmHg was significantly less in the induced normothermia group (P = 0.03).
A transcranial Doppler exam showed a normal flow pattern in the right hemisphere, but in the left hemisphere systolic spikes without diastolic flow were observed in internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, as well as in the MCA.
We discuss the clinical evidence regarding vasopressor administration for blood pressure management in patients with acute neurologic injury. The effect of various vasopressors on cerebral hemodynamics is also discussed.
Higher inpatient blood glucose was associated with impaired prognosis, with a threshold of 7.5 mmol/l (135 mg/dl) distinguishing best between favorable and unfavorable outcome. Inpatient glucose levels &gt;6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl) were associated with higher cerebral lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio (P &lt; 0.05). Cerebral glucose was elevated only at blood levels &gt;7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl). Inpatient glucose levels above 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) were independent predictors of unfavorable outcome and mortality.
A total of 224 consecutive patients were identified (145 females, 65%). Initial CT was performed within 24 h of the event in 163 (Group 1, 73%) and after 24 h in 61 patients (Group 2, 27%). A total of 54 patients (24%) developed angiographic vasospasm. A statistically significant association between the extent of subarachnoid blood and subsequent development of vasospasm was observed only if the initial CT imaging study was performed within 24 h of aneurysmal rupture (P = 0.0001 and 0.02 for HSS and MFS, respectively).
Since the 2004 conference on Sleep-Wake Disturbances in People With Cancer and Their Caregivers, an increased focus has existed on the prevalence and distress experienced by patients with cancer with sleep-wake disturbances, particularly insomnia. Evidence suggests that altered physiology directly related to the cancer process may play a prominent role in disrupting sleep, circadian rhythms, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-regulated processes. Reliable and valid objective and subjective measurements for screening and assessing sleep-wake disturbances are ready for use in clinical and research settings, and an increasing amount of intervention studies have reported sleep-wake outcomes in adult patients with cancer.
Findings highlighted gender's role in help-seeking behavior. Delayed help seeking for cancer symptoms was common, with many associated influencing factors. To date, research on intentions to seek help has facilitated the development of health-promotion programs that target those who are likely to delay.
Patients in intimate-partner dyads were younger, had greater incomes, and discovered the lump by routine mammogram as compared to family- or nonfamily-member dyads. No significant differences were observed in patients' physical or emotional adjustment. Patients with intimate partners had greater difficulty in their social and domestic environments. Partners in intimate-partner dyads had lower scores on psychological well-being, more problems in social and domestic adjustment, and less social support to promote social adjustment.
Dry heat was 2.7 times more likely than moist heat to result in successful IV insertion on the first attempt, had significantly lower insertion times, and was more comfortable. Heat type had no effect on patient anxiety.
Most participants reported mild-to-moderate levels of fatigue and pain. Twenty-one percent and 36% of patients might have had an anxiety or depression disorder, respectively. Significant correlations among the four symptoms supported the existence of the symptom cluster. The participants receiving chemotherapy had inadequate social support, experienced higher levels of symptoms, and were more likely to have a poorer QOL.
Patients' mean fatigue scores showed a statistically significant decrease and their EORTC QLQC-30 scores were better at T1 and T2 compared with baseline.
Medical and nursing journals have reported on research related to music and its effect as a nursing intervention. However, this research often lacks a musical context (i.e., knowledge and understanding from a musical perspective).
Three themes emerged from the interview data: (a) emotional responses to cancer diagnosis, (b) relationship with healthcare providers, and (c) use of spiritual resources in coping with cancer. Participants denied experiencing any discrimination in health care related to race, ethnicity, income, or language spoken. Perceptions of good and poor-quality health care are described.
Most participants identified centering prayer as beneficial. Emotional well-being, anxiety, depression, and faith scores showed improvement.
A cancer survivor is an individual who has been diagnosed with cancer, regardless of when that diagnosis was received, who is still living. Cancer survivorship is complex and involves many aspects of care. Major areas of concern for survivors are recurrence, secondary malignancies, and long-term treatment sequelae that affect quality of life. Four essential components of survivorship care are prevention, surveillance, intervention, and coordination. A CSCP should address the survivor's long-term care, such as type of cancer, treatments received, potential side effects, and recommendations for follow-up. It should include preventive practices, how to maintain health and well-being, information on legal protections regarding employment and health insurance, and psychosocial services in the community.
A fine line existed between offering food to a patient and forcing a patient to eat; often, conflict arose as a result. Contributors to that conflict focused on reduced dietary intake by the patient and the reaction to food refusal by the family, which frequently led to patients eating to please.
Returns after three mailings yielded 375 usable questionnaires from 907 eligible respondents for a return rate of 41%. The items with the highest perceived obstacle magnitude were (a) dealing with angry family members, (b) families not accepting what they are told about patients' poor prognosis, and (c) nurses being called away from dying patients to care for other patients. The three-highest scoring supportive behaviors were (a) allowing family members adequate time alone with patients after they died, (b) having social work or palliative care staff as part of the patient care team, and (c) having family members accept that patients are dying.
Seventy percent of participants reported an intention to avoid strenuous activity with their affected arm and reported more arm and chest symptoms than participants who did not avoid strenuous arm activity. Women who perceived that they were vulnerable to lymphedema and women who received advice about arm care were more likely to avoid strenuous arm activity.
Women described their symptoms as chronic, incurable, and uncontrollable, with multiple causes (usually not aging) and numerous negative consequences. Women described an average of six symptom management strategies, most typically self-care. The most frequent barrier to symptom management was communicating with healthcare providers.
The frequencies of the p.N314D, the Los Angeles and the Duarte variants were 11.5%, 2.5% and 9%, respectively.
The rate of premature birth was 15.1% [26/172 in the metabolic syndrome group vs. 11.7%; OR: 1.52 (95% CI: 0.996-2.33) p=0.051], in control group. Within the affected group 32 pregnancies were complicated with intrauterine grow retardation (18.6%); versus 3.6%, in the unaffected group; OR: 6.38 (95% CI: 4.24-9.61 p&lt;0.001). In 47 cases we observed preeclampsia during pregnancy [27.3%; vs. 4.7%; OR: 7.93 (95% CI: 5.54-11.33) p&lt;0.001] in the control group. Among the patients affected by the metabolic syndrome 67 patients (38.2%) had more then one pregnancy complications during pregnancy, and only 47 cases (27.3%) were lacking adverse events during pregnancy and delivery [OR: 3.11 (2.27-4.26) p&lt;0.001].
Neither the C1672T, and G-207C alleles, nor the TC haplotype were found to confer risk for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. By contrast, both of the minor allele frequencies of IGR2096a_1 T (48.1%) and IGR2198a_1 C (46.1%) were increased in Crohn's disease subjects as compared with the controls (38.5% and 38.4%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). Using regression analysis adjusted to age and gender these alleles were found to confer risk for Crohn's disease (OR=1.694, 95% CI: 1.137-2.522; p=0.010 for T allele, OR=1.644, 95% CI=1.103-2.449; p=0.015 for C allele of IGRs). In UC no such associations were found.
The botulinum toxin treatment was effective in 92% of the patients. It is a great importance that the therapy resulted significantly improvement in 56% of the patients. There was no significant difference neither among the types of the dystonia (cervical dystonia 87%, blepharospasm 93%, and hemifacial spasm 96%), nor among the medications (Botox 92%, Dysport 92%) in point of efficacy. Temporary weakness occurred only at 6 patients. There was neither serious side effect, nor complication related to the treatment.
In human participants, we analyzed B cells in blood as early as 17 days after HIV-1 infection, and in terminal ileum inductive and effector microenvironments beginning at 47 days after infection. We found that HIV-1 infection rapidly induced polyclonal activation and terminal differentiation of B cells in blood and in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) B cells. The specificities of antibodies produced by GALT memory B cells in acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) included not only HIV-1-specific antibodies, but also influenza-specific and autoreactive antibodies, indicating very early onset of HIV-1-induced polyclonal B cell activation. Follicular damage or germinal center loss in terminal ileum Peyer's patches was seen with 88% of follicles exhibiting B or T cell apoptosis and follicular lysis.
Total numbers of children and adolescents tested for T. cruzi in Yoro, Olopa, Entre Ríos, and Sucre were 24,471, 8,927, 7,613, and 19,400, respectively. Of these, 232 (0.9%), 124 (1.4%), 1,475 (19.4%), and 1,145 (5.9%) patients, respectively, were diagnosed as seropositive. Patients were treated with benznidazole, and early findings of seroconversion varied widely between the Central and South American programs: 87.1% and 58.1% at 18 months post-treatment in Yoro and Olopa, respectively; 5.4% by up to 60 months in Entre Ríos; and 0% at an average of 18 months in Sucre. Benznidazole-related adverse events were observed in 50.2% and 50.8% of all patients treated in Yoro and Olopa, respectively, and 25.6% and 37.9% of patients in Entre Ríos and Sucre, respectively. Most adverse events were mild and manageable. No deaths occurred in the treatment population.
We have used customised oligonucleotide microarrays to confirm that all of the differentially distributed genes identified by genome comparisons are expressed in intracellular amastigotes, with only a few of these subject to regulation at the RNA level. In the first large-scale study of gene expression in L. braziliensis, we show that only approximately 9% of the genes analysed are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle, a figure consistent with that observed in other Leishmania species. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species confirms the proposal that Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation but also identifies conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. We have also investigated whether host immune competence influences parasite gene expression, by comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes derived from either wild-type (BALB/c) or immunologically compromised (Rag2(-/-) gamma(c) (-/-)) mice. While parasite dissemination from the site of infection is enhanced in the Rag2(-/-) gamma(c) (-/-) genetic background, parasite RNA expression profiles are unperturbed.
Several synthetic peptides, designed for nanotechnology, have been examined for their ability to produce fibrils with Congo red affinity and concomitant green birefringence, affinity for thioflavin S and to accelerate AA-amyloidosis in mice. It is shown that some amphiphilic fibril-forming peptides not only produced Congo red birefringence and showed affinity for thioflavin S, but they also shortened the lag phase for systemic AA-amyloidosis in mice when they were given intravenously at the time of inflammatory induction with silver nitride. Peptides, not forming amyloid-like fibrils, did not have such properties.
Here we document with RT-PCR, western blot and immunocitochemistry analysis the presence of TRPM8 in human sperm. We also examined the participation of this channel in sperm function using specific agonists (menthol and temperature) and antagonists (BCTC and capsazepine). Computer-aided sperm analysis revealed that menthol did not significantly alter human sperm motility. In contrast, menthol induced the acrosome reaction in human sperm. This induction was inhibited about 70% by capsazepine (20 microM) and 80% by BCTC (1.6 microM). Activation of TRPM8 either by temperature or menthol induced [Ca(2+)]i increases in human sperm measured by fluorescence in populations or individual sperm cells, effect that was also inhibited by capsazepine (20 microM) and BCTC (1.6 microM). However, the progesterone and ZP3-induced acrosome reaction was not inhibited by capsazepine or BCTC, suggesting that TRPM8 activation triggers this process by a different signaling pathway.
Whereas the majority of mouthwash-derived DNA samples showed a single band of high molecular weight DNA by gel electrophoresis, 8.9% (95% CI: 7.1-10.7%) of samples contained only a smear of low-to-medium molecular weight, degraded DNA. The odds of DNA degradation in a subject's second mouthwash sample, given degradation of the first, was significantly greater than one (OR = 3.13; 95% CI: 1.22-7.39; Fisher's test P = 0.009), suggesting that DNA degradation was at least partially a subject-specific phenomenon. Approximately 12.4% (95% CI: 10.4-14.4%) of mouthwash-derived DNA failed to PCR amplify efficiently (using an approximately 200 bp microsatellite marker). However, we found there was no significant difference in amplification success rate between DNA samples judged to be degraded or non-degraded by gel electrophoresis (Fisher's test P = 0.5).
Incubation of human bronchial and tracheal smooth muscle (B/TSM) cells with TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or IL-4 resulted in a significant increase in FcepsilonRI-alpha chain mRNA expression (p&lt;0.05); and TNF-alpha, IL-4 enhanced the FcepsilonRI-alpha protein expression compared to the unstimulated control at 24, 72 hrs after stimulation. Interestingly, among all other cytokines, only TNF-alpha upregulated the FcepsilonRI-gamma mRNA expression. FcepsilonRI-gamma protein expression remained unchanged despite the nature of stimulation. Of note, as a functional consequence of FcepsilonRI upregulation, TNF-alpha pre-sensitization of B/TSM potentially augmented the CC (eotaxin-1/CCL11 and RANTES/CCL5, but not TARC/CCL17) and CXC (IL-8/CXCL8, IP-10/CXCL10) chemokines release following IgE stimulation (p&lt;0.05, n = 3). Furthermore, IgE sensitization of B/TSM cells significantly enhanced the transcription of selective CC and CXC chemokines at promoter level compared to control, which was abolished by Lentivirus-mediated silencing of Syk expression.
Here, we used Arc cellular compartmental analysis of temporal gene transcription by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) to identify neurons activated during single trial contextual fear conditioning in rats. To conform to temporal requirements of catFISH analysis we used a novel delayed contextual fear conditioning protocol which yields significant single- trial fear conditioning with temporal parameters amenable to catFISH analysis. Analysis yielded clear evidence that a population of BLA neurons receives convergent CS and US information at the time of the learning, that this only occurs when the CS-US arrangement is supportive of the learning, and that this process requires N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. In contrast, CS-US convergence was not observed in dorsal hippocampus.
Bone marrow cells were harvested from C57Bl/6 and Balb/c wild-type mice, expanded to NA-BMCs for 4 days and characterized by flow cytometry before transplantation in lethally irradiated recipient mice. Chimerism was detected using flow cytometry for MHC-I (H-2D[b], H-2K[d]), mu/huCD4, and huHLA-DR3). Culturing of bone marrow cells in a dexamethasone containing DMEM medium induced expansion of non adherent cells expressing CD11b, CD45, and CD90. Analysis of the CD45(+) showed depletion of CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+), and CD117(+) cells. Expanded syngeneic and allogeneic NA-BMCs were transplanted into triple transgenic mice. Syngeneic NA-BMCs protected 83% of mice from death (n = 8, CD4(+) donor chimerism of 5.8+/-2.4% [day 40], P&lt;.001). Allogeneic NA-BMCs preserved 62.5% (n = 8) of mice from death without detectable hematopoietic donor chimerism. Transplantation of syngeneic bone marrow cells preserved 100%, transplantation of allogeneic bone marrow cells 33% of mice from death.
Pair-wise alignment and comparison of the full-length S- and L-genomic segments indicated moderately low sequence similarity of 54-65% and 46-63% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, between NVAV and representative rodent- and soricid-borne hantaviruses. Despite the high degree of sequence divergence, the predicted secondary structure of the NVAV nucleocapsid protein exhibited the characteristic coiled-coil domains at the amino-terminal end, and the L-segment motifs, typically found in hantaviruses, were well conserved. Phylogenetic analyses, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed that NVAV formed a distinct clade that was evolutionarily distant from all other hantaviruses.
p55 TNFR deficient mice were crossed to an LDL receptor deficient background and were induced for the development of either atherosclerosis or AngII-induced AAA, and compared to littermate controls, wild-type for p55 TNFR expression. p55 TNFR deficient mice developed 43% smaller atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinuses compared to controls. Moreover, expression of CD68, a macrophage specific marker, exhibited a 50% reduction in the aortic arches. Decreased atherosclerosis correlated with a strong down-regulation in the expression of adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, by p55 TNFR deficient endothelium. In addition, expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines TNF, IL-6, MCP-1 and RANTES were significantly reduced in aortas of p55 TNFR deficient mice. In contrast, in the AngII-induced model of AAA, p55 TNFR deficiency correlated with a slight trend towards increased aneurismal lethality, but the incidence of aortic rupture due to a dissecting aneurysm, and the expansion of the suprarenal aorta were not significantly different compared to controls.
Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed on probable and confirmed cases of LACV infections reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2003-2007. A total of 282 patients had reported confirmed LACV infections during the study period. Of these cases the majority (81 percent) presented during the summer, occurred in children 15 years and younger (83.3 percent), and were found in male children (64.9 percent). Clinically, the infections presented as meningioencephalitis (56.3 percent), encephalitis (20.7 percent), meningitis (17.2 percent), or uncomplicated fever (5 percent). Deaths occurred in 1.9 percent of confirmed cases, and in 8.6 percent of patients suffering from encephalitis. The majority of these deaths were in patients 15 years and younger. The county-level incidence risk among counties (n = 136) reporting both probable and confirmed cases for children 15 years and younger (n = 355) ranged from 0.2 to 228.7 per 100,000 persons. The southern United States experienced a significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) incidence risk during the months of June, July, August, and October then the northern United States. There was significant (p&lt;0.05) clustering of high risk in several geographic regions with three deaths attributed to complications from LAC encephalitis occurring in two of these hot-spots of infections.
We profiled embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as they were induced to differentiate into trophectodermal cells by ectopic expression of HRas/Q61L. We also profiled murine embryos at progressive stages of preimplantation development (zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst), which includes the time window in which the trophectoderm is specified in vivo Q61L/H.
Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one luminal and two basal-like (A and B) subtypes. Luminal lines displayed an estrogen receptor (ER) signature and resembled luminal-A/B tumors, basal-A lines were associated with ETS-pathway and BRCA1 signatures and resembled basal-like tumors, and basal-B lines displayed mesenchymal and stem/progenitor-cell characteristics. Compared to tumors, cell lines exhibited similar patterns of CNA, but an overall higher complexity of CNA (genetically simple luminal-A tumors were not represented), and only partial conservation of subtype-specific CNAs. We identified 80 high-level DNA amplifications and 13 multi-copy deletions, and the resident genes with concomitantly altered gene-expression, highlighting known and novel candidate breast cancer genes.
Here, we report that multiple copies of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) are expressed from a single transcript that mimics the natural microRNA-30e precursor (mir-shRNA). The mir-shRNA, when microinjected into zebrafish embryos, induced an efficient knockdown of two developmentally essential genes chordin and alpha-catenin in a dose-controllable fashion. Furthermore, we designed a novel cassette vector to simultaneously express an intronic mir-shRNA and a chimeric red fluorescent protein driven by lineage-specific promoter, which efficiently reduced the expression of a chromosomally integrated reporter gene and an endogenously expressed gata-1 gene in the developing erythroid progenitors and hemangioblasts, respectively.
Stage I lung adenocarcinomas showed significantly (P = 0.012) higher frequency of IL-12Rbeta2 expressing samples than stage II/III tumors. IL-12 treatment of IL-12R(+) neoplastic cells isolated from primary adenocarcinoma (n = 6) inhibited angiogenesis in vitro through down-regulation of different pro-angiogenic genes (e.g. IL-6, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and laminin-5), as assessed by chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and PCR array. In order to perform in vivo studies, the Calu6 NSCLC cell line was transfected with the IL-12RB2 containing plasmid (Calu6/beta2). Similar to that observed in primary tumors, IL-12 treatment of Calu6/beta2(+) cells inhibited angiogenesis in vitro. Tumors formed by Calu6/beta2 cells in SCID/NOD mice, inoculated subcutaneously or orthotopically, were significantly smaller following IL-12 vs PBS treatment due to inhibition of angiogenesis, and of IL-6 and VEGF-C production. Explanted tumors were studied by histology, immuno-histochemistry and PCR array. NBEC cells were isolated and cultured from lung specimens of non neoplastic origin. NBEC expressed IL-12R and released constitutively tumor promoting cytokines (e.g. IL-6 and CCL2). Treatment of NBEC with IL-12 down-regulated production of these cytokines.
At sites in Canada (low nitrogen deposition) and the United States (high nitrogen deposition), individual pitchers were fed two amino acids, glycine and phenylalanine, and inorganic nitrogen (as ammonium nitrate), individually and in mixture. Plants took up intact amino acids. Acquisition of each form of nitrogen provided in isolation exceeded uptake of the same form in mixture. At the high deposition site, uptake of organic nitrogen was higher than uptake of inorganic nitrogen. At the low deposition site, uptake of all three forms of nitrogen was similar. Completeness of the associated detritus-based food web that inhabits pitcher-plant leaves and breaks down captured prey had no effect on nitrogen uptake.
Senior doctors (consultants and registrars, n = 32) attained significantly higher scores than junior doctors (senior house officers, foundation 1 and 2 doctors, n = 28, p = 0.001). Specialists (consultants and registrars in radiology and respiratory medicine, n = 7) achieved significantly higher scores than non-specialists (all other consultants and registrars, n = 25, p = 0.0002). In addition, senior radiologists (consultants and registrars) attained significantly higher scores than senior doctors from other specialities (p = 0.002).
Of 54 patients with fever, serology confirmed 21 with Chikungunya infection, 20 with Dengue infection, and three co-infections, with sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis of 92% for Chikungunya fever and 95% for Dengue fever. The mean age of patients with Chikungunya fever was 45 years (range 21-74 years), and patients with Dengue fever was 30 years (range 15-63 years) (p = 0.005). Sixteen (70%) of Chikungunya fever patients were females, while 15 (71%) of those with Dengue fever were males (p = 0.007). Arthralgia was common to both groups (p = 0.155), while headache and a bleeding tendency were observed more in patients with Dengue fever. Twelve (57%) Chikungunya cases had acute arthritis compared with none in the Dengue group (p = 0.001), lasting mean 6 days (range 1-14 days). They developed chronic arthritic disability (range 1-6 months). Leucopenia was common to both Chikungunya and Dengue fever patients. However, thrombocytopenia was more pronounced in the Dengue patients (mean (SD) platelet count 75 (34)x10(9)/l) than in the Chikungunya patients (117 (70)x10(9)/l) (p = 0.001). In the Chikungunya group there was a positive correlation between duration of the illness and the platelet count (r = 0.181, p = 0.194), but the Dengue group showed a negative correlation (r = -0.309, p&lt;0.001).
58% (n = 28) of patients who were prescribed antibiotics before admission received an inadequate dose or inappropriate antibiotic. Only 56% (n = 45) of GPs said they used guidelines for the treatment of acute sore throat. In 34 cases an organism was isolated, with 33 (97%) being sensitive to penicillin. No resistant organisms were isolated. Hospital doctors prescribed antibiotics contrary to guidelines in 39% (n = 35) of cases.
Using the VW, the retentive forces were statistically smaller at Pa compared to Ca or Bu (C: 58 +/- 17 gf, Pa: 36 +/- 7 gf , Bu: 50+/-8 gf) (P &lt; .05). There were no statistical differences between VD (C: 116+/-27 gf, Pa: 86+/-15 gf, Bu: 92+/-7 gf) and group P (C: 133+/-31 gf, Pa: 139+/-24 gf, Bu: 136+/-17 gf).
For a given material property, contacts in restoration generated the least amount of cuspal deformation, followed by the enamel contacts and contacts at restoration margin. Models of the intact tooth and ceramic inlay behaved similarly (cuspal widening at 100 N ranging from 1.8 to 3.0 microm and 1.6 to 2.6 microm, respectively). Cuspal flexure was increased in the MOD composite resin restorations (3.4 to 5.7 microm at 100 N of axial force). The least amount of deformation was generated in the ceramic inlay with contacts in only restoration (1.6 microm at 100 N) and the largest in the composite inlay with contacts at restoration margins (5.7 microm at 100 N). For the composite restoration, antagonist contacts at restoration margins were less favorable compared to located on either enamel or the restoration itself.
Healing of the ulcer was significantly faster (P &lt; .001), and adverse effects were significantly reduced (P &lt; .01) for the dexamucobase treatment compared to Kenalog in Orabase. There was no significant difference in the speed of pain reduction between the dexamucobase treatment compared to Kenalog in Orabase.
Initially, median retentive forces varied between 8.2 N and 14.0 N. During the test, patterns in retention changes were identified. At the end of the test, one group with a matrix using precious alloy lamellae and a titanium ball showed significantly higher median retention forces (10.4 N) than the other ball attachments (1.0 N to 3.7 N). Also, the wear of the ball attachments varied considerably.
No implants were lost (ie, survival rate = 100%). No difference was detected when comparing implants loaded after 4 months versus those loaded after 6 or more months (209 implants).
Exact agreement of chosen shade tab according to the 3D-Master shade guide was achieved in 48% of cases. Mean DeltaL*, DeltaC*, and Deltah* for all examiners were 1.9 (SD 1.7), 1.3 (SD 1.3), and 0.5 degrees (SD 0.7 degrees), respectively. The maximum deviation was 9 for DeltaL*, 7 for DeltaC*, and 3 degrees for Deltah*. Mean DeltaEab for the measurements was 2.7 (SD 1.8, range 0 to 9.5).
This study demonstrates the applicability of our defined differentiation process in generating functional hESC-derived DCs from multiple hESC lines. We show that hESC-derived immature DCs phagocytose, process, and present antigen upon maturation. hESC-derived mature DCs express the maturation marker CD83, produce Th1-directing cytokine IL-12p70, migrate in response to chemokine, and activate both viral and tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses.
BM-MSCs exhibited robust cell attachment and viability when cultured in fibrin in vitro. Furthermore, when injected together into the infarcted tissue, BM-MSCs in fibrin could enhance neovasculature formation by increasing capillary density, in comparison to treatment by cells or fibrin separately. Concomitant to significant improvement in capillary density was an increase in the levels of VEGF in the infarct scar.
The qualitative and quantitative assessment of accumulated extracellular matrix and the gene-expression analysis revealed marked interindividual differences, nevertheless the chondrogenic process was optimally supported in high-density pellet setup at ambient or 15% oxygen concentrations, irrespective of the origin of cells. The histochemical analysis based on alcian blue staining demonstrated that the differentiation took place in a gradient-like fashion, displaying highest levels in restricted regions, most often adjacent to the periphery. The two lowest hypoxic conditions, at 5 and 1% oxygen, seemed to have an inhibitory effect.
The study revealed that scientific research in regenerative medicine is thriving in the UK. Unfortunately, lack of access to capital, regulatory hurdles, lack of clinical evidence leading to problems with reimbursement, as well as the culture of the NHS do not provide a good environment for the commercialization of regenerative medicine products.
Thirty-four potentially important items were identified. All the steps of the consensus process were completed in 2.5 months. The opinions of experts and patients lead to the formulation of 17 questions. At the feasibility study the instructions and wording problems were corrected and a semi-tabular format was chosen.
The proportion of peripheral blood NKT-like (CD56+CD3+) cells in smokers with COPD (COPD subjects) was significantly lower (0.6%) than in healthy smokers (smokers) (2.8%, p &lt; 0.001) and non-smoking healthy participants (HNS) (3.3%, p &lt; 0.001). NK (CD56+CD3-) cells from COPD subjects were significantly less cytotoxic than in smokers (16.8% vs 51.9% specific lysis, p &lt; 0.001) as were NKT-like (CD56+CD3+) cells (16.7% vs 52.4% specific lysis, p &lt; 0.001). Both cell types had lower proportions expressing both perforin and granzyme B. Blocking the action of perforin and granzyme B reduced the cytotoxic activity of NK (CD56+CD3-) and NKT-like (CD56+CD3+) cells from smokers and HNS.
PSS scores for stroke survivors and caregivers were positively correlated (p&lt;.01). Scores decreased significantly over the year, but caregivers had higher scores initially and decreased less. Stroke survivor function was a significant predictor of stress for both survivors and caregivers. Preparation was the most powerful predictor of stress in caregivers, whereas mutuality was the strongest predictor for stroke survivors. Good health, social support, and coping were associated with less stress.
Significant increases in optimism at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks were found, with medium effect sizes for the TASK group relative to the control group (p&lt;.05). Significant improvements in task difficulty at 4 weeks, and threat appraisal at both 8 weeks and 12 weeks were also found (p&lt;.05).
Two themes emerged: wellness- and problem-oriented reasons for health care service use. Web users reported a large percentage of visits for rehabilitations reasons, which may have subsequently contributed to the musculoskeletal issues of this group. Laboratory work and testing was considered by both groups as a primary reason for provider visits. Non-Web users reported that medication adjustment was a common reason for provider visits. They also had more emergency department visits and hospital admissions for cardiology or pulmonology reasons.
Seven men and women with chronic ischemic stroke completed the 6-month intervention. The mean Berg Balance baseline score increased from 33.9+/-8.5 to 46+/-6.7 at 6 months (mean+/-SD; p=.006). Dynamic Gait Index increased from 13.7+/-3.0 to 19.0+/-3.5 (p=.01). Six-minute walk distance increased from 840+/-110 feet to 935+/-101 feet (p=0.02). VO2 peak increased from 15.3+/-4.1 mL/kg/min to 17.5+/-4.7 mL/kg/min (p=.03). There were no significant changes in falls efficacy or free-living ambulatory activity.
Psychosocial factors were significantly associated with HRQoL at every time point, accounting for 33% to 53% of the variance after controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. At least 26% of all participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms throughout the study. Compared to nondepressed participants, depressed participants had significantly poorer scores for HRQoL, social support, optimism, self-esteem, perceived control, and physical functioning. There were improvements in participants' physical health, social participation, depressive status, and optimism over the course of the study.
There was no significant difference in the upper lip height among the three groups. The Korean models had shorter lower lip to chin height than the two other groups. Full lip width was wider in the Korean and Caucasian models than in the Korean nonmodels. The Caucasian models had greater total vermilion area compared to both Korean groups. Finally, the Korean models had fuller lower and thinner upper vermilion areas than the nonmodels.
Eruption of the permanent canines in the group treated with straight-pull headgear was significantly more successful (88%) than in the group treated with an activator (62%).
The Tanaka-Johnston regression equations overestimated the actual mesiodistal widths of permanent canines and premolars. With the new regression equations, no statistically significant differences were observed between actual and predicted widths.
The mean and standard deviation for the YEN angle were calculated in all three skeletal groups. After using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman Keuls test, receiver-operating characteristic curves were obtained for the YEN angle in both types of classifications. The results showed that a patient with a YEN angle from 117 to 123 degrees could be considered to have a Class I skeletal relationship.
Increased VAT-1 mRNA and protein levels were found in glioblastoma tissues and cell lines compared with normal human brain. Small interfering RNA-mediated VAT-1 knockdown led to significantly reduced migration of human glioma cells.
Microarray analysis revealed gene ontology categories connected to developmental aspects and negative regulators of differentiation, especially in the infiltrative stem cell-like tumours. The highly invasive stem-like phenotype was chemoresistant compared with the angiogenic phenotype. By interfering with the PI3K it was possible to sensitize tumour spheroids to chemotherapy. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed downregulation of the stem cell markers Nestin and Musashi-1 in low-generation biopsy spheroids following PI3K inhibition.
Physiological variables defined dysfunction in 7 organ systems with 3 levels of severity (I to III). Neurologic and renal dysfunction had 3 levels of severity. Hematologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory dysfunction had 2 levels of severity where as hepatic and metabolic dysfunction had 1 level of severity. 1,3, and 5 points were assigned to level I, II, and III severity of organ dysfunction respectively. Malaria without any abnormal physiological variables had been considered as no organ failure and assigned 0 score. The cumulative scores in a patient is known as malaria severity score (MSS) that ranged from 0 to 21. Risk of mortality had been calculated for each score.
It was observed that female patients report significantly higher levels of depression than their male counter parts. Some slight high or no significant differences are observed between males and female patients with regard to the number of persons with whom they share their anxieties and fears regarding diabetes. There is not much difference has been observed in energy levels of both males and females. Also, Males have higher pwb value when compared with the female counterparts. Also, this may be due to women tend to react more emotionally to disease and hence experience more difficulty in coping with it. The present sample of women being predominantly house wives may be worrying more about their health and its problems. Also, it is observed that, gender differences are significant with regard to total general well-being. With five inputs (age, sex, weight, fasting plasma glucose, bias), four outputs are four (depression, anxiety, energy and positive well-being) the momentum rate was 0.9, the learning rate 0.7, using a sample of 50. the maximum individual error is 0.001 when the number of iterations were 500, number of hidden layers is 1 and the number of units in the hidden layer are 6, the normalized system error was 470.57. With input samples of 100, 150 and 200, keeping the other variables constant, the normalized system error was 419.61, 359.67 and 332.32 respectively. Similar values are found for the normalized system error when the number of units in the hidden layer have been increased to 7, 8 and 9 respectively. With two hidden layers, and with each hidden layer containing 6,7 ,8, 9, 10, 11 units for the samples 50, 100, 150, and 200, the same values of normalized system error was found. Women having weight between 40 kgs and 85kgs had higher levels of depression than men who had weight between 39kgs and 102 kgs.
The study group was divided into a non-CAD group (n=54), and a silent CAD group (n=22). Twenty-two diabetics were found to have silent CAD as evidenced by a positive TMT result (28.9%). The prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia was almost similar in both males and females. Serum LDL levels more than 140 mg% had a significant correlation with the prevalence of silent CAD (p = 0.04). The difference in CCA-IMT values was found to be statistically significant between the silent CAD and non-CAD groups (p = 0.019).
The mean age of the study was 38.6 +/- 11.6 years and 48% were males. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the modified PHQ-12 and the PHQ-9 item was 0.913 [p &lt; 0.0001]. Factor Analysis revealed that the modified PHQ-12 item scale can be used as a unidimensional scale and had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.88). A cut point of &gt;4 calculated using the ROC curves for the modified PHQ-12 item had the highest sensitivity (92.0%) and specificity (90.7%) using PHQ-9 as the gold standard. The positive predictive value was 76.7%, and the negative predictive value, 97.1% and the area under the ROC curve, 0.979 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.929 - 0.997, p &lt; 0.0001).
Of the 2440 identified studies, 49 cross-sectional and eight longitudinal studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven of the 49 cross-sectional studies that are included in this review detected more periodontal disease in diabetic subjects compared with non-diabetic subjects. The greater risk of periodontal disease progression was associated with type 2 DM, and one study associated DM with response to periodontal therapy. Methodological flaws of most of the studies included inadequate control for confounders, insufficient statistical analysis and lack of information about sampling design. Random effect model showed a significant association with clinical attachment level (mean difference = 1.00 [CI 95% = 0.15 to 1.84]) and periodontal pocket depth (mean difference = 0.46 [CI 95% = 0.01 to 0.91]) between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics.
None of the subjects were plaque-, calculus- or pocket-free. Of all, 26% reported that they brushed their teeth at least twice daily, 36% once daily and 38% less frequently. Women (P = 0.004), younger (P = 0.002) and higher educated respondents (P &lt; 0.001) reported twice daily toothbrushing more frequently than did their counterparts. Twice daily toothbrushing was clearly associated with the least severe conditions regarding dental plaque (P = 0.03) and deepened pockets (P &lt; 0.001), but not calculus (P = 0.39). Logistic regression models revealed higher level of education as the strongest factor odds ratio (OR = 2.7; P = 0.04) explaining the lowest scores of dental plaque. Higher frequency of toothbrushing was the strongest factor (OR = 2.1; P = 0.03) to explain the lowest scores of deepened periodontal pockets.
The mean colony-forming units (CFUs) of S. mutans at phase 1 when compared with baseline was not significant (P = 0.17). The other phases had a significant drop in mean CFUs of S. mutans from baseline (P &lt; 0.001). The percentage reduction of mean CFUs of S. mutans from baseline was the highest in phase 2 (86%).
All but four lesions were categorised as arrested caries during the 1-year follow-up period: 18 in the Carisolv/Duraphat group and 19 each in the Duraphat and the stannous fluoride groups, respectively. There was a minor reduction in the mean size of the lesions of around 0.1 to 0.2 mm height and width and a moderate change in colour from a lighter to a darker appearance. No obvious differences were found between the groups. The mean percentage of mutans streptococci in plaque from all lesions was 3.5% at baseline, and it decreased to 1.8% during the year. The decrease was, however, not statistically significant, and no significant differences were found between the groups.
The results showed that mean levels of self-confidence in individuals with current extracted teeth and with poor/very poor perceived gingival condition were statistically significant and lower than those with no current extracted teeth and with self-rated excellent gingival health (P &lt; 0.05). Also participants with self-reported gingival bleeding showed lower values of self-control compared with those with healthy non-bleeding gingiva (P &lt; 0.05). When oral health behaviour was evaluated, it was shown that students with higher scores of self-control were more likely to use everyday mouthrinses (P &lt; 0.05). The multiple linear regression analyses showed, for self-rated oral and gingival health status as dependent variable, a strong association with students' self-confidence level (P &lt; 0.05).
The proportion of individuals who reported oral impact on daily performances was 45.6%. The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only the altered condition of the oral mucosa and the social domain of the WHOQOL-BREF maintained an independent association with oral impact on daily performance.
Turkish mothers and pre-adolescents reported lower levels of self-efficacy and toothbrushing than did their Finnish counterparts (P &lt; 0.005). Finnish pre-adolescents reporting high self-efficacy were more likely to have mothers with high levels of self-efficacy (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.16 to 3.93), (P = 0.014). Similar positive associations emerged between Turkish (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.70 to 3.52), (P = 0.001) and Finnish (OR = 6.76, 95% CI = 2.21 to 20.65), (P = 0.001) pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal recommended (twice daily) level of toothbrushing behaviour. For pre-adolescents' toothbrushing, their own self-efficacy was the common explanatory variable. Binary logistic regression models revealed that the maternal toothbrushing accounted for the Turkish pre-adolescents' toothbrushing behaviour, whereas maternal self-efficacy did so for the Finnish pre-adolescents' (P &lt; 0.001) toothbrushing behaviour.
A strong relationship was detected with the presence of caries, badly broken and missing teeth, and self-reported need for care. Embarrassment due to one's dental health was also associated with the perceived need, although satisfaction with the appearance was not. Neither demographic and socioeconomic status nor self-rated oral health was significantly associated with a currently perceived dental problem.
Significant differences were found on self-liking, self-competence and body investment subscales according to several variables: perceived dental health, current non-treated caries, current extracted teeth, satisfaction by the appearance of own teeth, the last time toothache occurred, self-reported gingival condition and self-reported gum bleeding. When oral health behaviours were analysed, an association between self-liking, self-competence and body investment subscales and flossing, mouthrinse and dental visit pattern was revealed. Toothbrushing frequency once a day or less was observed in persons with low-levels of self-liking, body care, body protection and perfectionism. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that age, gender, smoking habits, anxiety, stress, depression in everyday life, self-liking, self-competence, body image, care and protection were positively associated with oral health behaviours.
In 141 CABG patients TOE had a level 1 impact in 73%, level 2 impact in 11.6%, levels 3 and 4 in 7% and 7.8% respectively. In 178 non CABG patients these values were 2%, 1.6%, (p &lt; 0.05), 72.4% (p &lt; 0.05) and 23.6% (p &lt; 0.05) respectively.
ALT, AST, GGT and LDH increased significantly in the morbidly obese than they did in non obese patients. In morbidly obese patients TBil increased gradually peaking 7 days after anesthesia, LDH increased in the recovery room, AST and ALT increased in the recovery room and first day, while GGT increased 7th day after anesthesia. In non obese patients, AST, LDH increased in the recovery. ALP did not change in both groups.
172 patients responded to this survey. The majority of patients (76%) had very good postoperative analgesia. There was a 9.3% incidence of leakage of clear fluid, a 5.8% incidence of premature dislodgement, and an 8.7% incidence of shortness of breath. Residual neurological symptoms persisted in 18.6% of responders, all resolving within two months except in one case. A large proportion (40%) required no oral analgesics, and half of the rest required less than 3 pain pills. Most (94.1%) felt comfortable removing the catheters at home by themselves or by a family member/caretaker.
39 patients entered the study, 20 in Group A, and 19 in Group B. Data collection was complete for all. There was a statistically significant difference in sampling-induced blood loss between the groups over the first 72 hours of treatment (mean +/- standard deviation: 15.16 +/- 5.3 ml Group A vs 45.11 +/- 14 ml Group B, p&lt;0.001). There was a smaller decline in mean hemoglobin level, which was not statistically significant (0.79 +/- 0.6 g/dL vs 1.30 +/- 1.13, p = 0.09).
The duration of sensory block was longer in intravenous dexmedetomidine group compared with control group (261.5 +/- 34.8 min versus 165.2 +/- 31.5 min, P &lt; 0.05). The duration of motor block was longer in dexmedetomidine group than control group (199 +/- 42.8 min versus 138.4 +/- 31.3 min, P &lt; 0.05).
Analysis revealed that the heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure significantly differed between groups (p&lt;0.001, p = 0.003, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively). The highest rates of heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure were in the placebo group and in one minute after laryngoscopy, and the lowest rate were in the gabapentin group at the time of 1, 3, 5 and 10 after laryngoscopy, except that the lowest rate of heart rate in 10 min after laryngoscopy was in clonidine group.
Of the 84 pediatric children with cancer, pain was nociceptive in 26 (31%), neuropathic in 12 (14.3%) and mixed in 46 (54.8%). Almost 7 (8.3%) of patients were on WHO step 3 at baseline. Thereafter the WHO step 3 increased; first week visit 36 (43%) patients; second week visit 58 (69%), and third week 69 (82.1%). At baseline, 40 (47.6%) patients took NSAID only, 2 (2.4%) patients took adjuvant, while 38 (45.2 %) patients took combination of NSAID and adjuvant treatment. There was statistically significant (p = 0.000) reduction in VAS as time progressed.
Pain scores were significantly lower in acetaminophen group at different times (p&lt;0.001) and needed less rescue analgesic (p&lt;0.001).
Average VAS values from both trials did not differ between pregnant and control group exposed to the mechanical or electrical stimulus after EMLA application or after mechanical or electrical stimulus after placebo cream application..
The PP and TT increased the mean arterial and airway pressures and decreased lung compliance, and were associated with respiratory acidemia, while changes in heart rate remained within normal range. The duration of PP was shorter in TIVA patients but mean arterial pressure was higher than ISO group. ISO was associated with increased plasma concentrations ofprothrombin, fibrinogen and aspartate aminotransferase.
The sensory and motor block onset time were shortened in study group (2.61 vs. 5.09 and 4.22 vs. 7.04 min, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). The recovery time of sensory and motor block and onset of tourniquet pain were also prolonged (7.26 vs. 3.43, 9.70 vs. 3.74 and 25 vs. 16.65 min., respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). Analgesia time after tourniquet deflation was prolonged and tourniquet pain intensity was lowered in study group (p &lt; 0.05). Intraoperative fentanyl and meperedine requirement during first postoperative day and pain intensity at 4, 6, 12 and 24 hr postoperatively were lower in the study group (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant side effects.
The mean occlusion pressure 161.6 (17.2) mmHg was always higher than the mean initial arm systolic blood pressure 131.7. The maximum venous pressure was significantly higher in the manual technique 176.7 (15.4) mmHg than in the pump technique 161.3 (12.3) mmHg (p = 0.04). The incidence of lidocaine leak was significantly lower (35.71%) in the pump technique compared to (78.5%) in the manual technique (p = 0.02). Moreover; the mean lidocaine plasma concentrations was significantly higher [0.86 (0.5) microg x ml(-1)] in the manual technique compared to [0.32 (0.4) microg x ml(-1)] the pump technique (p = 0.04).
The time to extubation was similar in both groups. The intraoperative heart rate was significantly lower in the GR group.
Participants in the intervention group experienced a modest yet significant weight loss, while the control group gained weight. The mean 12-month weight loss in the intervention group was 4.1 pounds (1.9 kg). High program attrition rates hindered program effectiveness and data collection.
In the examined groups there were no statistically significant differences in the duration of anesthesia (68.29 +/- 6.47 vs 66.29 +/- 11.97 min, p = 0.327). The time to eye opening was significantly shorter in the group VIMA compared to the group TCI (4.49 +/- 1.20 vs 7.42 +/- 1.25 min, p = 0.000), as well as the time to respond to a command (5.93 +/- 1.12 vs 8.47 +/- 1.08 min, p = 0.000). The patients anesthetised with VIMA technique wer estatistically significantly extubated earlier (6.84 +/- 1.19 vs 9.69 +/- 1.31 min, p = 0.000). Considering orientation time, there was also statistically significant difference between the two groups (7.51 +/- 0.97 vs 11.60 +/- 1.75 min, p = 0.000). There was no statistically significant difference in PAD time duration (19.42 +/- 5.99 vs 20.80 +/- 1.59 min, p = 0.142). There were no statistically significant differences in PONVA events between the examined groups.
Implant reconstructions were most common, 44 (52.3%), with primary reconstruction in 31 (70.4%) and secondary in 13 (29.5%) women. Lattisimus dorsi flap (LDF) and implant were utilized in 32 (38%) of the patients, with primary reconstruction in 24 (75%) and secondary in 8 (25%) women. Transversal rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap was rarely used -- just in 8 (9.5%) patients and only for secondary breast reconstruction. Postoperatively, some early complications such as hematoma, seroma, infections and partial flap necrosis were observed in 10 (11.9%) patients. Late complications, such as implant rejection, hypertrophic scarring and hernias at the flap elevation site, were noted in 10 (11.9%) cases. Implant loss occurred in 5 (5.9%) cases. All the complications were successfully managed, and patients rated their reconstruction as follows: excellent, 49 (59%) cases; very good, 20 (24%), and good, 14 (16.8%). In one case, disease progression was observed 6 months after the primary breast reconstruction.
There was no significant difference in patients age. Women were found to be significantly more likely to have OLP (p &lt; 0.001). Corticosteroids were effective in reducing symptoms, erythema and healing ulcers. Improvement was shown over a long term in 61.35% patients. Over the long term 38.65% patients maintained the same type of OLP or it became a more severe type. Two patients (1.22%) developed oral carcinoma during the follow-up period.
The obtained results showed that 11 (17.5%) patients had VEGF expression less than 20% and 29 (82.5%) above 20%. A statistical significance was immanent with positive nodal status (p &lt; 0.05) and disease stage (p &lt; 0.05). No statistical correlation was found between the level of VEGF expression and histological and nuclear grade, tumor size, disease relapse or patients overall survival.
Comparing the results the highest ligature effects were shown at the level of IPV ostium in the stem of VSM and VSP of both groups (p &lt; 0.0001) with the highest diameter reduction. There was a smaller reduction of diameter in the proximal and distal segment of ostium in the group I, while there was no diameter change in the distal segment of ostium in the group II.
There was no significant difference in prevalence of hypertension among the male (1.81%) and female students (0%). The prevalence of obesity (Body Mass Index - BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in the male (7.27%) than in the female population (1.32%). Abdominal obesity was also more frequently encountered (p &lt; 0.01) in the male (9.09%) than in female population (1.32%). Every fourth student smoked cigarettes with no significant difference between the male and female students. Alcohol consumption was a significantly higher problem (p &lt; 0.001) in the male population (18.18%) than in the female one (2.65%). Physical inactivity was more often found (p &lt; 0.001) in the female students (65.56%), than in male ones (36.36%). By the bivariate correlation of cardiovascular risk factors, it was determined that in the male student population systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with diastolic blood pressure, BMI and waist size, whereas age correlated with sistolic blood pressure, waist size and smoking. In the female students sistolic blood pressure correlated with diastolic blood pressure, BMI and waist size; diastolic blood pressure correlated with BMI and physical inactivity; cigarette smoking correlated with alcohol consumption and age.
In basal condition, diabetic patients compared to controls have significant higher values of TG (3.12 +/- 1.09 vs 1.74 +/- 0.9 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.01), Ox LDL (84.73 +/- 16.90 vs 79.00 +/- 29.26 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.05) and SOD enzyme activity (913.38 +/- 120.36 vs 877.14 +/- 153.18 U/g Hb, p &lt; 0.05). During the acute exercise test, there was significant increase of Ox LDL in both the study patients (from 84.73 +/- 16.90 to 92.33 +/- 23.29 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.05) and in the control group (from 79.00 +/- 29.26 to 89.30 +/- 29.07 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.05). SOD activity was significantly increased in both groups during exercise, in diabetic patients from 913.38 +/- 120.36 to 921.50 +/- 130.03 U/gHb, p &lt; 0.05, and in the controls from 877.14 +/- 153.18 to 895.00 +/- 193.49, U/gHb, p &lt; 0.05. GSH-Px activity was significantly increased only in the diabetic patients after the acute exercise (from 45.04 +/- 11.19 to 51.81 +/- 15.07 U/gHb, p &lt; 0.01), but not in the controls (from 44.63 +/- 13.73 to 43.97 +/- 25.97 U/gHb, p = ns). PAI significantly decreased during the exercise test, only in the healthy subjects (from 2.60 +/- 0.35 to 2.22 +/- 0.65, p &lt; 0.05). Type 2 diabetic patients with complications had only significant increase in GSH-Px activity (from 47.10 +/- 7.37 to 54.52 +/- 11.97 U/gHb, p &lt; 0.01).
A total of 66.5% subjects had common carotid artery intima-media thickness &gt; 0.9 mm (p &lt; 0.01). The mean CRP plasma concentration was significantly higher in the subjects with common carotid artery intima-media thickness &gt; 0.9 mm than in those with common carotid artery intima-media thickness &lt; or = 0.9 mm. In a simple regression analysis age adjusted CRP was associated with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (beta = 0.285, p &lt; 0.01), and only high density lipoprotein cholesterol was not associated with common carotid artery intima-media thickness. The association between CRP and common carotid artery intima-media thickness remained highly significant after controlling for body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin and smoking (p &lt; 0.01). Controlling for glucose, triglycerides to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio resulted in some reduction in the strength of the association, but including waist circumference in the regression made the relationship no longer significant (p = 0.119). Body mass index (beta = 0.352; p &lt; 0.01), total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (beta = 0.334; p &lt; 0.01) and age (beta = 0.190; p = 0.036) were the independent predictors of common carotid artery intima-media thickness.
In Belgrade, during the observed 15-year-period, the number of new NPC patients totaled 118, of which 86 (72.9%) were male and 32 (27.1%) were female. The average standardized incidence rate for men was 0.52 per 100,000 and for women 0.16 per 100,000. In both sexes the incidence was very low before 40 years of age. In men, the greatest incidence rate of NPC was in the 50-59 years age group, and in women in those 60 and more years old. Furthermore, undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type was 3.6 times more often in comparison to squamous cell carcinoma.
There are many names for Advanced Practice Nurses, and although many of these roles are similar in their function, they can often have different titles.
The majority of respondents (93%) viewed CE to be very important and preferred methods of continuing education included receipt of information by email, and interactive online case studies. Respondents working in metropolitan areas had increased access to high speed Internet in comparison to NPs working in rural or remote areas, although this did not reach statistical significance (88% vs. 69%, p = 0.07). Significantly more NPs working in metropolitan areas had access to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) than NPs working in rural or remote areas (44% vs. 6%, p = 0.003).
Four hours of videotape (observed clinical practice) and 2 h of audio tape (interviews) were coded. They performed procedures (22%), gathered information to identify at risk patients (21%), conducted patient assessments (20%) and relayed information/findings to ward nurses (12%) and doctors (12%). The roles/responsibilities of AHCSs were similar to those defined for NPs. For the domain "dynamic practice" 388 activities were identified. The two participants used advanced and comprehensive assessment skills and demonstrated a high level of proficiency in performing procedures/interventions. For the domain "professional efficacy" 174 activities were coded, for "clinical Leadership" there were 135 activities. "Pro-actively identifying at risk patients in general wards" was added as a new performance indicator within the domain "clinical leadership". An analysis of the interviews corroborated the results derived from the visual data.
Thirty-three patients were studied. Motor responses to stimulation via the catheters were obtained at 1 mA or less in 55% of patients and at greater than 1 mA in 45%. Various motor responses involved twitches of the pectineus (12%), sartorius (18%), or quadriceps (48%) muscles, or no muscular twitch up to 5 mA (22%). Catheter-induced motor response at 1 mA or less was associated with median values of VAS scores lower than those at greater than 1 mA (0 vs 30 mm; P = 0.008).
For several cancers (oesophagus, stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, lung, prostate) there was evidence of increased risk among alcohol consumers compared with abstainers and occasional drinkers. For most sites, it was beer and to a lesser extent spirits consumption that drove the excess risks.
Twenty-four patients were included in each group. Median effective volume blocking the sciatic nerve was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the STIM group (2.7 mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-4.9 mL) compared with the NONSTIM group (16.6 mL; 95% confidence interval, 15.2-18.0 mL).
ME patients were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) younger and their age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 for benign tumors of 10.0 in men and 17.6 in women were higher than similar rates of 7.3 and 10.6 in the NHNMW group (p &lt; 0.05). Rates for malignant tumors were similar. Meningioma was the main histology responsible for the observed increase in patients over 40 years of age. Also increased were benign tumors of the pituitary and pineal glands. The overall mortality in patients with benign tumors was significantly lower than malignant tumors.
Patient's with long poly-A repeat showed a significant association with disease (chi 2 = 9.52, df = 2, P &lt;or= 0.01). Compared to subjects having two S alleles (SS), odds ratios (and 95% CI) were 0.75 (0.45-1.23) and 2.49 (1.18-5.27) for subjects having genotypes SL and LL, respectively. Among matched pairs (age), the poly-A LL genotype was found significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer among early-onset cases (P = 0.02). The unconditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between grade and LL genotype [(unadjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 4.45 (1.87, 10.63); adjusted odds ratio: 4.66 (1.88, 11.53)]. No significant association was observed for the VDR ApaI (chi 2 = 1.00, df = 2, P = 0.60) and TaqI polymorphism (chi 2 = 0.35, df = 2, P = 0.83). Although, strong LD was not observed among these polymorphic sites, it denies the total equilibrium at the same time. Based on haplotype distribution, the most common one observed among cases and controls was ATS while, genotype AATTLL had shown a significant association with the breast cancer risk (P = 0.02).
The spinal cord and cauda equina were observed in the gravity-dependent side of the subarachnoid space in each position. The movement to the gravity-dependent side by changing position from the supine to the lateral decubitus position was significant (mean [SD] in millimeters: T11/12, 0.7 [0.4]; T12/L1, 1.5 [0.9]; L1/L2, 3.0 [1.0]; L2/L3, 3.4 [1.0]; L3/L4, 2.7 [0.9]; L4/L5, 2.0 [0.9]; L5/S1, 1.2 [0.7]; S1/S2, 0.5 [0.2]). The most obvious shift was observed at the L2/3 intervertebral space. The fully flexed legs significantly moved the spinal cord and cauda equina to the ventral side of the subarachnoid space and created a free space in the dorsal side. The movement to the ventral side by the fully flexed legs was significant (mean [SD] in millimeters: T11/12, 2.2 [1.0]; T12/L1, 4.1 [1.5]; L1/L2, 6.1 [0.5]; L2/L3, 5.4 [0.9]; L3/L4, 5.1 [1.9]; L4/L5, 4.4 [1.1]; L5/S1, 5.0 [0.9]; and S1/S2, 2.6 [0.9]). The most obvious shift was observed at the L1/2 intervertebral space.
For MTR A2756G, alleles and genotypic distributions differed significantly between cases and controls (p = 0.00009, OR = 3.27, CI 95% 1.76-6.12). While, in non-smokers patients the slow NAT2 did not appear to influence bladder cancer susceptibility; our results suggested that it might act with an additive contribution with tobacco as well as with that determined by MTR 2756 AG or 2756 GG genotypes (p = 0.0008). Identical cumulative effect was detected for slow NAT2 and MTHFR 677*T variant (p = 0.0003; OR = 36.6; CI 95% 3.4-935.3).
Of the 40 anesthetists, 12 (30%) correctly identified the nerve. This was no better than chance (25%) and shows that the tested anesthetists were unable to correctly identify beyond chance what tissues they were injecting into. When those who did not practice regional anesthesia regularly (n = 7) were excluded, similar results were obtained. Ten (30%) of the 33 self-identified experienced regional anesthetists correctly identified the nerve. A score that measured the number of correctly identified tissues (score 1) was used to compare anesthetists on grade and level of experience. This showed that the more experienced anesthetists did better than the less experienced ones.
Intra-pulmonary injection of 3,4-benzopyrene steady induced lung carcinoma at a success rate of 75%. Administration with green tea drinking significantly reduced the incidence of lung carcinoma to 30%. Green tea up-regulated p53 expression in lung carcinoma, but significantly down-regulated bcl-2 expression.
The scores discriminated children with ADHD diagnosis (mean and [SD], 28 [6.288]) from normal children (10.93 [8.009]), and those with a non-ADHD psychiatric diagnosis (16.63 [8.865]). ADHD cutoff points were obtained for male (23.5) and female (22.5) children. Psychosocial characteristics associated with children having ADHD were not associated with the diagnosis of ADHD.
FEV1 decreased more than 10% in 30% of the players. EIB positivity was more common in Sfax (15.8%) than in Tunis (7.7%) (P=.03). Air humidity during the study was higher in Tunis.
We identified only 32 cases of male breast cancer over the 24-year period. Male breast cancer accounted for 32 (2.8%) of 1141 resected breast specimens, which included all breast lesions and 32 (4.1%) of 780 breast cancer cases. Of the 32 cases, 20 (62.5%) had various associated risk factors. Invasive ductal carcinoma was seen in 30 cases (93.7%). Of 20 cases that underwent molecular studies, 16 (80%) patients had estrogen receptor positivity whereas 14 (70%) had progesterone receptor positivity. Six cases (30%) overexpressed HER2 and p53. The BRCA2 mutation was observed in 4 cases (40%) while no patient presented with the BRCA1 mutation.
The study included 186 subjects who had a mean age of 45.3 years and included 87 (47%) females. The major problem reported in more than 102 (55%) of the subjects was anxiety/depression. All of the ten apriori hypothesis relating EQ-5D responses to external variables were fulfilled. Cohenâs k for test-retest reliability (n=52) ranged from 0.48 to 1.0.
Older age was associated with a decreased total FSD index and its domain scores. Women with obesity were more likely to have impaired arousability and impaired capability of reaching orgasm. About 58.5% of women reported that they prepared themselves if they had sexual desire and 68.2% reported wearing special attire for this purpose. Only 37.2% of women could ask their husband for a special excitement.
There were 25 malignant and 30 benign lesions. Eight lesions were seen by MRI only and we could not verify their pathology since we did not have MR-guided biopsy facilities at the time of the study. On MR mammography, the proven carcinomatous lesions were characterized as BI-RADS category V in 16 (64%), category IV in 7 (28%), and category III in 2 (8%) lesions. Benign lesions were graded as category V in 3 (10%), category IV in 6 (20%), and category III in 3 (10%), category II in 10 (33%) and category I in 8 (27%) lesions. The MRM BI-RADS category accurately predicted malignancy in 92% and a benign pathology in 70% of the lesions. The overlap between the MRM features of chronic inflammatory lesions and carcinomas resulted in a lower accuracy in diagnosing benign as compared to malignant lesions.
Compared to WHO reference standards, the median height of Bahraini children and adolescents in the age range of 6 to 18 years was close to the 25th percentile or lower, while the median BMI during adolescent years was comparable in boys, but higher than WHO standards in girls, reaching the 75th percentile. The cutoff values of BMI for overweight/obesity status (85th and 95th percentile) were higher by 3-6 kg/m(2) compared to WHO standards. While skin fold thicknesses were also higher in Bahraini adolescents compared to their American counterparts (NHANES II), arm muscularity was substantially lower.
The most prevalent mental symptoms in the 545 female students were phobic anxiety (16.4%), psychoticism (14.8%), anxiety (14.3%), and somatization (14.2%). The prevalence of depression, paranoid ideation and interpersonal sensitivity amounted to 13.9%, 13.8% and 13.8%, respectively. The least prevalent mental symptoms were hostility (12.8%) and obsessive-compulsive behavior (12.3%). Overall, psychological symptoms (in terms of a positive global severity index) were found in 16.3% of the girls. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, no significant relationship was found with sociodemographic factors.
In clinical evaluation, there were rapidly proliferating multiple nodular lesions at the skin, breasts, lungs, ovaries and peritoneum accompanied by only increased CA 125 in tumor marker panel. The initial biopsy performed from a skin nodule was concordant with a metastatic carcinoma suggesting breast as the primary. The diagnosis was made by immunohistochemical staining of the second biopsy performed from a breast nodule.
There is a high prevalence of substance misuse among persons with early psychosis, with cannabis and alcohol featuring prominently. Substance misuse is associated with earlier onset and possibly more positive symptoms, although apparently not with greater cognitive impairment. Cannabis appears to confer an increased likelihood of developing schizophrenia in biologically vulnerable individuals. Amphetamines also cause psychosis which may become chronic, although specific vulnerability to this effect is less well established. Many cases of so-called 'drug-induced psychosis' become diagnosed as schizophrenia in later years. Specific intervention programs report positive outcomes with regard to substance misuse and the course of psychosis.
There was an increase in contacts per month and associated outpatient costs after the index admission which persisted for the full 12 month data collection period (total of AUD $637). There was also a total increase in hospital costs but this did not persist beyond the first 2 months of the follow-up period and is likely explained by the index admission.
Seventy percent of the CTO sample were found to be incompetent according to the MacCAT-T, compared to 20% of the comparison group (p = 0.004). The proportion of the CTO sample found to be incompetent reduces to 50% if the subscale of appreciation is excluded (p = 0.004). Most people in each group would elect to continue their current treatment if given the choice.
While there was a significant reduction overall in symptoms following an inpatient stay, patient characteristics and reason for admission were not related to outcomes at a statistically significant level.
Children generally coped well with the interview. They identified themes involving stigma, qualities and approaches of staff, aspects of the CAMHS environment, and anxiety about attending CAMHS as key issues.
The sample consisted of 93 patients; SGAs were taken by 31% of admitted and 88% of discharged patients. Of these, 65% had their weight recorded, 61% height, 31% random blood sugar levels, 3% postprandial blood sugar levels, 2% glycosylated haemoglobin, and 7.5% cholesterol and triglycerides. Girth and BMI were not recorded. Abnormalities were detected in 29% of recorded BSL and 2% of recorded cholesterol.
A reduction in alprazolam prescribing in Tasmania occurred after the interventions.
A total of 123 students participated. Only one student identified psychiatry as their chosen career. Medical students viewed psychiatry as the least attractive specialty for the degree to which patients are helped effectively and in terms of having a reliable scientific foundation. However, it rated well in regard to being intellectually challenging, a rapidly advancing field of medicine, and providing research opportunities and a good lifestyle. Psychiatry is less respected than most other specialties by students and they perceive this discipline to be poorly respected by other medical students and current medical practitioners. After viewing the DVD, there were improved student ratings of the benefits of a career in psychiatry, especially in relation to the specialty being enjoyable, offering effective treatment and having a scientific foundation. There was also enhanced understanding of the role of a psychiatrist in just over half of the participants and increased interest in psychiatry in about 30% of participants. The DVD was most effective in increasing awareness of the diversity of subspecialties available within psychiatry, good lifestyle factors, and the training involved.
We have developed SNEP, a new method that allows simultaneous detection of both nucleotide and expression polymorphisms. SNEP involves a robust statistical procedure based on the idea that a nucleotide polymorphism observed at the probe level can be regarded as an outlier, because the nucleotide polymorphism can reduce the hybridization signal intensity. To investigate the performance of SNEP, we used three species: barley, rice and mice. In addition to the publicly available barley data, we obtained new rice and mouse data from the strains with available genome sequences. The sensitivity and false positive rate of nucleotide polymorphism detection were estimated based on the sequence information. The robustness of expression polymorphism detection against nucleotide polymorphisms was also investigated.
We show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of two maternally acquired endosymbiont infections within the wider E. atra meta-population and we demonstrate through several independent approaches a link between the presence of one of these endosymbionts, Rickettsia, and the tendency for long-distance movement.
MAP CRCs frequently localized to the proximal colon (69%, 40/58), were mucinous in 21% (9/42), and had a conspicuous Crohn's like infiltrate reaction in 33% (13/40); all of these parameters occurred at a higher rate than reported for sporadic CRCs. Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were also highly prevalent in MAP CRCs. Somatic APC MCR mutations occurred in 14% (5/36) while 64% (23/36) had KRAS2 mutations (22/23 c.34G&gt;T). G&gt;T transversions were found in p53 and SMAD4, although the relative frequency compared to other mutations was low.
Using immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and MPSS, we found that all three cell lines actively proliferated and expressed similar "stemness" markers including transcription factors POU5F1/Oct3/4 and NANOG, glycolipids SSEA4 and TRA-1-81, and alkaline phosphatase activity. All cell lines differentiated into three embryonic germ lineages in embryoid bodies and into neural cell lineages when cultured in neural differentiation medium. However, a profound variation in colony morphology, growth rate, BrdU incorporation, and relative abundance of gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiated states of the cell lines was observed. Undifferentiated I3 cells grew significantly slower but their differentiation potential was greater than I6 and BG01V. Under the same neural differentiation-promoting conditions, the ability of each cell line to differentiate into neural progenitors varied.
We generated ex-vivo primary cultures from two independent human insulinomas and from a human nesidioblastosis, all of which were cultured up to passage number 20. All cell lines secreted human insulin and C-peptide. These cell lines expressed neuroendocrine and islets markers, confirming the expression profile found in the biopsies. Although all beta cell lineages survived an anchorage independent culture, none of them were able to invade an extracellular matrix substrate.
At baseline, three-quarters of clients (n = 633) received advice, on exercise, diet, posture, points to work on at home or other ways of self-care. At 6 months follow-up, about four-fifths reported making changes to their lifestyle 'as a result of having shiatsu treatment', including taking more rest and relaxation or exercise, changing their diet, reducing time at work and other changes such as increased body/mind awareness and levels of confidence and resolve. Building on the findings, an explanatory model of possible ways that a CAM therapy could contribute to health promotion is presented to guide future research, both within and beyond CAM.
Both spatial and temporal heterogeneity affected the relationship between population growth rate and population density in all four species. Spatial heterogeneity accounted for 23-30% of the variance in population growth rate after accounting for the effects of density, reflecting big differences in local carrying capacity associated with the landscape features important to individual species. Temporal heterogeneity accounted for 3-13% of the variance in vole, skylark and spider, but 43% in beetles. The associated temporal variation in carrying capacity would be problematic in traditional analyses of density dependence. Return rates were less than one in all species and essentially invariant in skylarks, spiders and beetles. Return rates varied over the landscape in voles, being slower where there were larger fluctuations in local population sizes.
Comparative evolutionary analysis of chicken (Gallus gallus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genes identified interleukin 4 receptor alpha-chain (IL-4Ralpha), a key cytokine receptor as a candidate with a significant excess of substitutions at nonsynonymous sites, suggestive of adaptive evolution. Resequencing and detailed population genetic analysis of this gene in diverse village chickens from Asia and Africa, commercial broilers, and in outgroup species red jungle fowl (JF), grey JF, Ceylon JF, green JF, grey francolin and bamboo partridge, suggested elevated and balanced diversity across all populations at this gene, acting to preserve different high-frequency alleles at two nonsynonymous sites.
Our comprehensive analyses of the phylogenetic distribution and phylogeny of the YidC/Oxa/Alb3 family lead to the following findings: 1) In archaea, YidC homologs are only sporadically distributed in Euryarchaeota; 2) Most bacteria contain only one YidC gene copy; some species in a few taxa (Bacillus, Lactobacillales, Actinobacteria and Clostridia) have two gene copies; 3) Eukaryotic Oxa and Alb3 have two separate prokaryotic origins, but they might not arise directly from the YidC of proteobacteria and cyanobacteria through the endosymbiosis origins of mitochondrium and chloroplast, respectively; 4) An ancient duplication occurred on both Oxa and Alb3 immediately after their origins, and thus most eukaryotes generally bear two Oxa and two Alb3. However, secondary loss, duplication or acquisition of new domain also occurred on the two genes in some lineages, especially in protists, resulting in a rich diversity or adaptive differentiation of the two translocases in these lineages.
By the Affymetrix microarrays HG-U133 2.0 Plus, 53 genes were distinguished as differentially expressed before and soon after IL-2 deprivation. Among those, PIM1, BCL2, IL-8, HBEGF, DUSP6, OSM, CISH, SOCS2, SOCS3, LIF and IL13 were down-regulated and RPS24, SQSTM1, TMEM1, LRRC8D, ECOP, YY1AP1, C1orf63, ASAH1, SLC25A46 and MIA3 were up-regulated. Genes linked to transcription, cell cycle, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, cell adhesion, and immune functions were found to be overrepresented within the set of the differentially expressed genes.
To gain new insights into the molecular host-parasite interactions that take place during malaria liver infection, we have used high-throughput microarray technology to determine the transcriptional profile of P. berghei-infected hepatoma cells. The data analysis shows differential expression patterns for 1064 host genes starting at 6 h and up to 24 h post infection, with the largest proportion correlating specifically with the early stages of the infection process. A considerable proportion of those genes were also found to be modulated in liver cells collected from P. yoelii-infected mice 24 and 40 h after infection, strengthening the data obtained with the in vitro model and highlighting genes and pathways involved in the host response to rodent Plasmodium parasites.
Through the analysis of a gene expression dataset containing 318 liver samples from rats exposed to hepatotoxicants and leveraging alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a serum enzyme indicative of liver injury as the phenotypic marker, we identified biological processes and molecular pathways that may be associated with mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Our analysis used an approach called Coherent Co-expression Biclustering (cc-Biclustering) for clustering a subset of genes through a coherent (consistency) measure within each group of samples representing a subset of experimental conditions. Supervised biclustering identified 87 genes co-expressed and correlated with ALT in all the samples exposed to the chemicals. None of the over-represented pathways related to liver injury. However, biclusters with subsets of samples exposed to one of the 7 hepatotoxicants, but not to a non-toxic isomer, contained co-expressed genes that represented pathways related to a stress response. Unsupervised biclustering of the data resulted in 1) four to five times more genes within the bicluster containing all the samples exposed to the chemicals, 2) biclusters with co-expression of genes that discerned 1,4 dichlorobenzene (a non-toxic isomer at low and mid doses) from the other chemicals, pathways and biological processes that underlie liver injury and 3) a bicluster with genes up-regulated in an early response to toxic exposure.
EST-driven prediction identified 4,935 genes (16% of the total Arabidopsis genome) which, according to the origin of EST sets, were associated with defense responses in the reference genome. Profiles of defense-related genes, obtained by mapping of heterologous EST, represent putative Arabidopsis homologs of the corresponding species. Comparison of these profiles in pairs and locating common genes allowed estimating similarity between defense-related gene sets of different plant species. To experimentally support computer data, we arbitrarily selected a number of transcription factor genes (TF) detected by EST mapping. Their expression levels were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction during infection with yellow strain of Cucumber mosaic virus, a compatible virus systemically infecting Arabidopsis. We observed that 65% of the designated TF were upregulated in accordance with the EST-generated profile.
Functional disability was equally common in men and women over 65 years, and in both sexes disability was more common at older ages. Neuronal loss in several subcortical regions elevated the risk of functional disability by three-fold (95% CI 1.3-6.6). There was evidence for a relationship between Lewy bodies in the SN and functional disability.
Spirometry as assessed by clinical records was to BTS standards in 31% of cases (range at practice level 0% to 74%). The categorisation of airflow obstruction according to the most recent spirometry results did not agree well with the clinical categorisation of COPD recorded in the notes (Cohen's kappa = 0.34, 0.30 - 0.38). 12% of patients on COPD registers had FEV1 (% predicted) results recorded that did not support the diagnosis of COPD. There was no association between quality, as measured by adherence to BTS spirometry standards, and either QOF COPD9 achievement (Spearman's rho = -0.11), or QOF COPD10 achievement (rho = 0.01).
Our findings showed that a majority of participants (11/15) expressed inaccurate beliefs regarding the degree with which individualized care will be maintained in the research setting (TM1) and a smaller number of participants (5/15) manifested an unreasonable belief in the likelihood of benefits to be obtained from a research study (TM2). A total of 12 of the 15 participants were judged to have expressed a TM on either one of these bases.
A CNV in BMPR2 was present in one African American negative control subject.
Haplogroup J1 was found to be 2.4 fold under-represented in the 'HP' patients (p = 0.0035). These results are consistent with a previous observation made in Finnish T2DM patients. Moreover, assessing the haplogroup distribution in 'DP' versus 'HP' patients having diabetic siblings revealed that haplogroup J1 was virtually absent in the 'HP' group.
We constructed a zur null mutant of Y. pestis biovar microtus strain 201. Microarray expression analysis disclosed a set of 154 Zur-dependent genes of Y. pestis upon exposure to zinc rich condition. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was subsequently used to validate the microarray data. Based on the 154 Zur-dependent genes, predicted regulatory Zur motifs were used to screen for potential direct Zur targets including three putative operons znuA, znuCB and ykgM-RpmJ2. The LacZ reporter fusion analysis verified that Zur greatly repressed the promoter activity of the above three operons. The subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that a purified Zur protein was able to bind to the promoter regions of the above three operons. The DNase I footprinting was used to identify the Zur binding sites for the above three operons, verifying the Zur box sequence as predicted previously in gamma-Proteobacteria. The primer extension assay was further used to determine the transcription start sites for the above three operons and to localize the -10 and -35 elements. Zur binding sites overlapped the -10 sequence of its target promoters, which was consistent with the previous observation that Zur binding would block the entry of the RNA polymerase to repress the transcription of its target genes.
The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was evaluated using the 2-Delta C'T method and ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. For the in-vitro model using primary cultures of rat astrocytes, all genes analysed except for Rpl13a and Sdha were found to have significantly different levels of mRNA expression. These different levels were also found in the case of the in-vivo model of pMCAO in rats except for Hprt, Sdha and Ywhaz mRNA, where the expression did not vary. Sdha and Ywhaz were identified by geNorm and NormFinder as the two most stable genes.
(1) With respect to improvement in the mechanical strength of the lumbar spine and the femoral midshaft, the combination treatment of ALF and RIS at their sub-therapeutic doses was more effective than each administered as a monotherapy; (2) In the suppression of bone resorption and the amelioration of microstructural parameters, the effects of ALF and RIS were considered to be independent and additive; (3) The improvement of material properties, such as microstructural parameters and the biological apatite (Bap) c-axis orientation, contributed to the reinforcement of spinal strength; and (4) The combination treatment of ALF and RIS normalized urinary Ca excretion, suggesting that this treatment ameliorated the changes in Ca metabolism.
Deficiencies in teamwork and conflicting role definitions between doctors and nurses and between family practitioners and medical specialists were found to be central problems affecting the provision of appropriate palliative care for older people. It was emphasized that there are great advantages to family doctors playing a leading role, as they usually have the longest contacts to the patients. However, the professional qualifications of family doctors were to some extent criticized. The general practitioners for their part criticized the increasing specialization on the field of palliative care. All groups complained that the German compensation system gives insufficient consideration to the time-consuming care of older patients, and about excessive bureaucracy.
In all, 618 deaths were recorded among 7,867 external in-migrants, 255 among 4,403 internal migrants, 310 among 11,476 out-migrants and 1900 deaths were registered among 17,771 residents. External in-migrants were 28% more likely to die than residents [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) = 1.28, P &lt; 0.001, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.16, 1.41)]. In the sub-group analysis, the odds of dying from AIDS was 1.79 [adjusted Odd ratio (aOR) = 1.79, P = 0.009, 95% CI (1.15, 2.78)] for external in-migrants compared to residents; there was no statistically significant difference in AIDS mortality between residents and out-migrants, [aOR = 1.25, P = 0.533, 95% CI (0.62-2.53)]. Independently, females were more likely to die from AIDS than males [aOR = 2.35, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI (1.79, 3.08)].
The initial response was 73% and 252 persons had complete data collection at baseline. In total, 36 subjects were lost during follow-up. Participants were predominantly low educated, long-term unemployed, and in poor health. Participation in the programme was not influenced by demographic and psychological factors or by self-reported health. Drop-outs were younger and had a lower body mass index at baseline than subjects who completed the programme. At post-test, participants' cardiorespiratory fitness, abdominal muscle strength, and flexibility had increased by 6.8%-51.0%, whereas diastolic and systolic blood pressures had decreased by 2.2%-2.5%. The effect sizes ranges from 0.17-0.68.
Anti-Eg5 antibodies were used to investigate localization of Kinesin-5-like proteins in brown algal zygotes. In interphase zygotes, localization was predominantly within the nucleus. As zygotes entered mitosis, these motor proteins strongly associated with spindle poles and, to a lesser degree, with the polar microtubule arrays and the spindle midzone. In order to address whether Kinesin-5-like proteins are required to maintain spindle bipolarity, we applied monastrol to synchronized zygotes containing bipolar spindles. Monastrol is a cell-permeable chemical inhibitor of the Kinesin-5 class of molecular motors. We found that inhibition of motor function in pre-formed spindles induced the formation of multipolar spindles and short bipolar spindles.
Here, we characterized the 5' untranslated regions of the different transcript variants. We also cloned and functionally tested the alternatively utilized gene promoters that contribute to the production of different MTUS1 transcript variants.
A hospital-based laboratory surveillance study was conducted among the patients admitted between November 2007 and October 2008 to the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital (Population = 1103) with diarrhoeal complaints. Of the 1103 samples collected, 147 were positive for Giardia lamblia, 84 for Cryptosporidium sp. and 51 for Entamoeba histolytica. For all these parasites there was a high rate of mixed infection with common enteric viruses and bacteria such as Rotavirus, Vibrio cholerae and Shigella sp. There were also cases of co-infection with all other diarrheogenic pathogens. The age group &gt;or= 5 years had the highest prevalence of parasites whereas the age group &gt;5 - 10 years was predominantly infected with Giardia lamblia (p =&lt; 0.001; Odds ratio (OR) = 3.937; 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 1.862 - 8.326) and with all parasites (p = 0.040; OR = 2.043; 95% CI = 1.033 - 4.039). The age group &gt;10 - 20 years could also be considered at risk for G. lamblia (p = 0.009; OR = 2.231; 95% CI = 1.223 - 4.067). Month-wise occurrence data showed an endemic presence of G. lamblia whereas Cryptosporidium sp. and E. histolytica occurred sporadically. The GIS study revealed that parasites were more prevalent in areas such as Tangra, Tiljala and Rajarhat, which are mainly slum areas. Because most of the population surveyed was in the lower income group, consumption of contaminated water and food could be the major underlying cause of parasitic infestations.
Young women in the intervention group more commonly reported pregnancy than did those in the comparison group (16% v 6%; adjusted odds ratio 3.55, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 9.50). Young women in the intervention group also more commonly reported early heterosexual experience (58% v 33%; adjusted odds ratio 2.53, 1.09 to 5.92) and expectation of teenage parenthood (34% v 24%; 1.61, 1.07 to 2.43).
This independent validation indicated that QRISK offers an improved performance in predicting the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease in a large cohort of UK patients over the Anderson Framingham equation. Discrimination and calibration statistics were better with QRISK. QRISK explained 32% of the variation in men and 37% in women, compared with 27% and 31% respectively for Anderson Framingham. QRISK underpredicted risk by 13% for men and 10% for women, whereas Anderson Framingham overpredicted risk by 32% for men and 10% for women. In total, 85 010 (8%) of patients would be reclassified from high risk (&gt;or=20%) with Anderson Framingham to low risk with QRISK, with an observed 10 year cardiovascular disease risk of 17.5% (95% confidence interval 16.9% to 18.1%) for men and 16.8% (15.7% to 18.0%) for women. The incidence rate of cardiovascular disease events among men was 30.5 per 1000 person years (95% confidence interval 29.9 to 31.2) in high risk patients identified with QRISK and 23.7 per 1000 person years (23.2 to 24.1) in high risk patients identified with Anderson Framingham. Similarly, the incidence rate of cardiovascular disease events among women was 26.7 per 1000 person years (25.8 to 27.7) in high risk patients identified with QRISK compared with 22.2 per 1000 person years (21.4 to 23.0) in high risk patients identified with Anderson Framingham.
All 31 patients had preoperative diplopia and restricted motility. 22 patients wore prisms prior to surgery. Of the 31 patients who underwent surgery 9 required a second operation. After reoperation 5 patients (16%) continued to have diplopia. However, 4 of these patients were able to achieve single binocular vision with a small amount of prism. Only 2 patients were unable to achieve single binocular vision with or without prism. 22 patients (71%) had full ocular motility after surgery. After one surgery, 25 of 31 patients (81%) were satisfied with the results of surgery. This increased to 29 patients (94%) after reoperation.
Residual large angle esotropia and good adduction were obtained postoperatively despite a severed and consecutively lost medial rectus muscle.
Monoclonal (LUCA14, MAB1189, Gi11, and PACA4) and polyclonal (40-9000) antibodies were employed to evaluate JAM-C expression/localization in various epithelial cell lines. However, RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) assays revealed no JAM-C mRNA in SK-CO15, HeLa and HPAF-II cells, whereas abundant mRNA was detected in platelets, Caco-2 and ARPE cells. Interestingly, immunofluorescence localization in all cells revealed strong intercellular junctional staining with all of the above antibodies, except PACA4. Given the positive staining results in cells lacking JAM-C mRNA, immunoblot analyses were performed. Western blots revealed a prominent protein band at 52 kDa in all cells tested with all antibodies except PACA4. However, the correct size of JAM-C (37 kDa) was only detected in cells containing JAM-C mRNA. Immunofluorescence staining of JAM-C mRNA-expressing Caco-2 cells using mAb PACA4 revealed co-localization with occludin and ZO-1 (zonula occludens 1) at TJs. Analyses by MS identified the cross-reactive 52 kDa protein band as K8 (keratin 8). Furthermore, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated downregulation of K8 in JAM-C mRNA-negative cells resulted in diminished junctional staining along with a reduction in the intensity of the 52 kDa protein band. Using an antibody specific for K8 phosphorylated at Ser73, the 52 kDa protein was identified as this phosphorylated form of K8.
Staurosporine can induce death of HeLa cells via a cytochrome c/caspase-9/caspase-3 mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway and via a delayed caspase-independent pathway. In contrast with p53wt cells, p53mt C-33A cells exhibit firstly caspase-8 activation leading to caspase-3 activation and Bid cleavage followed by cytochrome c release. Attenuation of PARP-1 [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1] cleavage as well as oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the presence of z-VAD-fmk points toward a major involvement of a caspase-dependent pathway in staurosporine-induced apoptosis in p53wt HeLa cells, which is not the case in p53mt C-33A cells. Meanwhile, the use of 3-aminobenzamide, a PARP-1 inhibitor known to prevent AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) release, significantly decreases staurosporine-induced death in these p53mt carcinoma cells, suggesting a preferential implication of caspase-independent apoptosis. On the other hand, we show that p53, whose activity is modulated by pifithrin-alpha, isolated as a suppressor of p53-mediated transactivation, or by PRIMA-1 (p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis), that reactivates mutant p53, causes cytochrome c release as well as mitochondrio-nuclear AIF translocation in staurosporine-induced apoptosis of cervical carcinoma cells.
Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that InsP3R1 associated with PKA type IIbeta and AKAP450, the longer variant of AKAP9, in sheep cerebellar microsomes. The co-purification of AKAP450 with InsP3R1 on heparin-agarose provided further evidence of the association of these proteins. Immunohistofluorescence experiments on slices of cerebellar cortex showed that AKAP450 was colocalized with InsP3R1 and RIIbeta (regulatory subunit of PKA IIbeta) in granule cells, but not in Purkinje cells. AKAP450 was localized in the Golgi apparatus of these two cell types whereas InsP3R1 was detected in this organelle only in granule cells.
In the present study we use high resolution AFM analysis of endometrial epithelial cells to monitor the effect of progesterone on the nanoscale structure of the endometrial cell surface. High-resolution imaging reveals similar topographical nanoscale changes in both the Hec-1-A and Ishikawa model cell lines. Hec-1-B cells, used in the present study as a progesterone receptor negative control, however, exhibit a flattened cell surface morphology following progesterone treatment. Changes in average cell height and surface convolution correlate with increased surface roughness measurements, demonstrating alterations in molecular structure on the cell surface due to hormonal stimulation.
For the primary school pupils there was evidence of both a season of birth and an age-position effect on all of the cognitive measures, particularly in the early years of schooling. There was, also, evidence of a significant age-position effect at both KS3 and GCSE in favour of the older pupils. For the younger primary school pupils there was evidence of significant age-position effects on both motor measures.
On Equilibrium in the Balance the Y8 pupils were down on the proportion at the early formal level or above by -0.61 standard deviations (SD) for boys and -0.63 SD for girls on the 1976 results. On the Pendulum the Y9 boys were down by -0.49 SD and the girls by -0.48 SD on the proportion at the early formal level or above.
A significant difference in questionnaire's scores between year 1 and year 2 (but not between year 2 and 3) was found with respect to conceptions about knowledge construction, self-regulation, and the use of authentic problems, but not for cooperative learning and motivation to learn. For self-perceived inability, an interaction effect was found. Furthermore, results showed significant differences between both curriculum groups on all dependent measures.
Multiple regression analyses revealed that incremental beliefs of ability significantly and positively predicted active coping, planning, venting of emotions, seeking social support for emotional and instrumental reasons, whereas entity beliefs positively predicted behavioural disengagement and negatively predicted active coping and acceptance. In addition, analyses revealed that entity beliefs of ability were related to coping strategies through students' perception of control over academic examinations.
The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations.
Students who participated in the lessons for dialogic citizenship education were able to justify their opinion better than students who participated in regular history lessons. The results further show a positive effect of the amount of group work involved.
The results showed that perceived parental practices accounted for moderate, but statistically significant amounts of variance in different aspects of school adjustment.
In both experiments, students in the iterative condition gained more knowledge of arithmetic procedures, including ability to transfer the procedures to problems with novel features. Knowledge of concepts was fairly comparable across conditions. Finally, pre-test knowledge of one type predicted gains in knowledge of the other type across experiments.
Traditional psychometric assessments of the AGQ and PALS replicated previous studies. For both, reliability estimates ranged from good to very good for raw subscale scores and fit for the models of goal orientations were good. Based on traditional psychometrics, the AGQ and PALS are valid and reliable indicators of achievement goals. Rasch analyses revealed that estimates of reliability for items were very good but respondent ability estimates varied from poor to good for both the AGQ and PALS. These findings indicate that items validly and reliably reflect a group's aggregate goal orientation, but using either instrument to characterize an individual's goal orientation is hazardous.
Preliminary factor analyses conducted at the student level supported the a priori four factors that the SREQ was designed to measure. However, multi-level analyses indicated that there was almost no differentiation between faculties or departments nested with faculties, suggesting that the SREQ responses are not appropriate for benchmarking faculties or departments.
At final follow-up, activity levels were significantly higher in the resurfacing group, with a mean weighted activity score of 10.0 points (range, 1.0 to 27.5 points), as compared to a mean score of 5.3 points (range, 0 to 12.0 points) in the THA group. Mean Harris hip scores, patients satisfaction scores, and pain scores were similar for both groups. There were no revisions in either group.
Of the basic science studies, two investigations found evidence that favored total hip arthroplasty, while three favored resurfacing hip arthroplasty. For the clinical studies, all reports showed that resurfacing hip arthroplasty had similar or better outcomes than total hip arthroplasty at short- to midterm follow-up. The gait studies suggest that resurfacing provides a more natural gait than conventional total hip arthroplasty.
There was considerable variation observed in the amount and distribution of cement, partly as a consequence of variable bone quality in this "all-comers" included series. The cement analyses showed that the newer cementing techniques helped to reduce over-penetration while providing better cement interdigitation. The use of extra fixation holes and cementing the stem in cases with poor bone quality were associated with improved cement-to-bone contact area.
Fourteen hips in 13 patients (20%) developed a small scalloped, corticated erosion in the posterior neck, just distal to the femoral component and adjacent to the acetabular component rim. These erosions were between 5 and 10 mm in depth and became apparent at an average of 15 months (range, 6 to 24 months) following surgery. After 2 years, they showed no further progression. The location and shape of the erosions indicate PFAI as the etiology. One hip also demonstrated similar changes in the anterior neck. The Harris Hip Score and UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) Activity Scores were higher in patients with such erosions (97.5 and 9.2, respectively), compared to those patients without (93.5 and 8.4, respectively). Additionally, patients with erosions reported slightly better pain relief on average than patients with no radiographic evidence of impingement. No significant differences in range of motion or component position were found between the two groups.
There were 279 cases of incident CHD in the cohort over 8 years; in those with arthritis, 11.7% developed incident CHD, compared to 9.8% in those without arthritis (p = 0.24). Age-adjusted rates of incident CHD in those with and without arthritis were 20.5 and 18.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively (p = 0.25). Arthritis was not significantly associated with CHD risk factors. Arthritis was not a significant independent predictor of incident CHD (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.51).
SVT was induced during six of the 65 exercise tests performed in three of 53 patients (overall sensitivity 5.7%). All three patients had a history of exercise- induced symptoms, and two had ventricular preexcitation. SVT was induced in 12% of patients with exercise- related symptoms. No other rhythm disturbances occurred during exercise testing.
Aortic PP (59+/-12 mmHg versus 43+/-10 mmHg; P&lt;0.001) and ascending AP (0.54+/-0.10 versus 0.48+/-0.10; P&lt;0.001) were significantly higher in the metabolic syndrome group. Multiple regression analysis revealed statistically independent relationships between ascending AP and fasting blood glucose, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure (model R2=0.408; P&lt;0.001). The metabolic syndrome, as a whole, was also independently associated with both ascending AP (P&lt;0.01) and aortic PP (P&lt;0.01).
There is evidence to suggest that to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 AIT, a careful history and physical examination should be performed to identify pre-existing thyroid disease. An iodine-131 uptake test and colour flow Doppler sonography should be performed. Patients with type 2 AIT should receive a trial of glucocorticoids, whereas those with type 1 should receive antithyroid therapy. For patients in whom the mechanism of the thyrotoxicosis is unclear, a combination of prednisone and antithyroid therapy may be considered.
Of the 124 patients (mean follow-up period of 2.3+/-1.6 years), 46 patients (37%) had a normal study, 15 patients (12%) had an inconclusive study and 63 (51%) had an abnormal PET. Patients with a normal PET had no deaths or nonfatal MI. One patient with a normal PET underwent late revascularization (annual event rate of 1.7%). Patients with an abnormal PET had 15 cardiac events (one cardiac death, four nonfatal MIs and 10 late revascularizations), with an annual event rate of 13.0% (P=0.002).
The first three CCSA classes were inversely related to the DASI. The mean (+/- SD) scores were as follows: class I, 31.4+/-16.7; class II, 22.5+/-15.4; class III, 14.7+/-14.3; and class IV, 15.5+/-14.9 (P&lt;0.01). Increasing CCSA class was associated with increased long-term mortality, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Chest pain course was also an important modulator of mortality among class III and IV patients; one-year mortality rates were 8.1% among unstable patients compared with 4.8% among patients with stable or progressing course.
Although 27% of participants were missing cardiac MRI data, multiple imputation returned results similar to those of a complete case analysis. These results were robust to the point of including additional variables in the imputation analysis above and beyond the model variables. The degree of variance explained by the models increased marginally but the statistical inference was altered for only two predictors out of 53 cardiovascular risk factors using multiple imputation.
The mean (+/- SD) age was 53+/-9 years (60% men). Baseline demographics were similar between the volunteers allocated to receive either placebo or ramipril. The geometric mean CRP at baseline was 3.84 mg/L (95% CI 3.62 mg/L to 4.06 mg/L). The percentage change in geometric mean CRP values over 12 weeks was --13.2% (95% CI --22.3% to --3.2% ) in the placebo group compared with --21.1% (95% CI --29.9% to --11.2%) in the ramipril group (P nonsignificant), indicating no significant reduction in the primary end point of the trial.
Celacade inhibited transforming growth factor beta-1 production in the infarct area on day 7 (191.6+/-22.6 pg/mg versus 275.4+/-30.1 pg/mg; P&lt;0.05), but did not attenuate cardiac dilation in MI. Celacade restored positive inotropism of pacing in MI (F5 Hz/0.5 Hz in Celacade, 219.1+/-46.7%; MI, 148.1+/-27.1% [P&lt;0.05 compared with 211.4+/-37.9% in sham]). Celacade reduced diastolic dysfunction in MI (root mean square of spontaneous SL fluctuations: 121+/-15% and 143+/-19% with Celacade versus 184+/-19% and 190+/-26% without Celacade at 26 degrees C and 36 degrees C, respectively) compared with sham (100%; P&lt;0.05).
Induction of myocarditis was associated with significant loss of body and heart weight, decreased left ventricular function, and increased collagen content and cellular infiltrates in the myocardium. Treatment of infected animals with IL-15 resulted in normalization of body and heart weight, and significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function, comparable with that of uninfected animals. This was paralleled by a significant reduction of myocardial collagen content to levels observed in animals without disease and by markedly reduced cellular infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages in the myocardium. Inhibition of intrinsic IL-15 with IL-15 fusion protein tended to aggravate the disease.
A total of 435 patients (77% men and 80% Saudis) with a mean age of 57.1 years were enrolled. Medical history included previously diagnosed ischemic heart disease (32%), percutaneous coronary intervention (12%), diabetes mellitus (53%), hypertension (48%), current smoking (39%), hyperlipidemia (31%) and family history of premature coronary artery disease (11%). The median door-to-needle time for fibrinolytic therapy received by patients with STEMIs was 90 min. Inhospital medications included acetylsalicylic acid (98%), clopidogrel (73%), angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (74%), beta-blockers (73%), statins (88%), unfractionated heparin (80%), low-molecular weight heparin (22%) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (9%). The inhospital mortality rate was 5%.
Patients were aged between 25 and 58 years and occipital headache was the most common complaint. The mean duration of preoperative symptoms was 4 years and the follow-up time was 25 months. Clinical progression was halted for all patients; eight patients completely recovered and two reported no change. In one patient, there was a transient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula that was treated with tissue adhesive. While syringomyelia persisted radiologically with radiological stability in five patients; for three patients the syringomyelic cavity decreased in size, and for the remaining two it regressed completely.
From spring of 1992 to fall of 2003, there were 27,367,580 deaths in the United States and 170,984 decedents with PF. The average mortality rate among all persons with PF was 17.1% higher in winter (p &lt; 0.0001), 12.7% higher in spring (p &lt; 0.0001), and 5.2% higher in fall (p = 0.0002) than in summer months. These findings persisted when records with a diagnostic code for pneumonia were excluded from the analysis as well as when only records in which PF was the underlying cause of death were included in the analysis.
Forty-one patients completed the study. MO patients (n = 20) used 6.8 +/- 1.9 mg/h (mean +/- SD) and 5.5 +/- 3.6 mg/h of morphine during the first and second hours, respectively; MK patients (n = 21) used 3.7 +/- 1.2 mg/h and 2.8 +/- 2.3 mg/h, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). The 4-h activation rate of the device was double in the MO patients than in the MK patients (66 +/- 54 vs 28 +/- 20, p &lt; 0.001). The maximal self-rated pain score was 5.6 +/- 1.0 for the MO group vs 3.7 +/- 0.7 for the MK group (p &lt; 0.01). Four MO patients vs one MK patient required diclofenac; 6 MO patients but no MK patients had oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry &lt; 94% on a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4 (p &lt; 0.01); two MO patients required reintubation. Paco(2) was higher in the MO group (40 +/- 6 mm Hg vs 33 +/- 5 mm Hg, p &lt; 0.05). Heart rate, BP, and incidence of nausea/vomiting were similar; no ketamine-related hallucinations were detected.
A total of 182 patients (94 in the EBUS CDPs group and 88 in the EBUS-TBNA plus CDPs group) were analyzed. The yield in the EBUS-TBNA plus CDPs group (78.4%) was significantly higher than the EBUS CDPs group (60.6%, p = 0.015). Cases in which the EBUS probe was located within the lesions had a significantly higher diagnostic yield (78.3%) than when the EBUS probe was adjacent to them (47.2%, p &lt; 0.001). Concerning the three different techniques, TBNA showed the highest diagnostic yield (62.5%) in comparison to TBB (48.9%) and to BW (19.8%). The diagnostic yield of TBNA remained unchanged even when the EBUS probe was adjacent to the lesions (p = 0.89). No additional adverse effects were observed in the EBUS-TBNA plus CDPs group.
Compared to patients with PAH, patients with PVH had a higher frequency of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Two or more features of the MS were found in 16 of 17 patients with PVH (94.1%) compared with 34.3% of patients with PAH (p &lt; 0.001; odds ratio, 30.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 260.0). PH was substantial, but less severe overall, in patients with PVH compared to those with PAH (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 45 +/- 17 mm Hg [range, 26 to 71 mm Hg] vs 53 +/- 10 [range, 33 to 72 mm Hg], respectively [p = 0.041]; and pulmonary vascular resistance, 4.4 +/- 2.9 units [range, 1.2 to 10.8 units] vs 10.8 +/- 4.7 units [range, 4.8 to 21.9 units], respectively [p &lt; 0.001]).
ASMs had higher numbers of AMs per milliliter of BAL fluid than ANSs (1.98 vs 0.75 x 10(6) cells/mL, respectively; p = 0.007). Cigarette smoking significantly attenuated the LPS response for all three cytokines tested among ANSs vs ASMs (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, 31.6 vs 10.6 ng/mL, respectively (p = 0.01); interleukin [IL]-6, 25.8 vs 10.8 ng/mL, respectively (p = 0.002); IL-8, 62.5 vs 36.1 ng/mL, respectively (p = 0.001)). There was no difference in dexamethasone dose-response curves between ANSs and ASMs (p &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons). The inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC(50)) for IL-6 was 120.6 vs 83.3, respectively, and for TNF-alpha it was 4.9 vs 8.6, respectively; an IC(50) was not achieved for IL-8. RT-PCR also showed no difference in the suppression of cytokine messenger RNA levels between groups, with IL-8 being the most GC-insensitive cytokine.
Significant reductions in circulating levels of TNF, sTNFR-I, sTNFR-II, and sVCAM-1 were observed among participants over the course of the smoking cessation program. Serum levels of both IL-6 and CRP declined during the smoking cessation program; the changes were not statistically significant, however.
The mean OAHI for the two groups was approximately 10.0 episodes/h total sleep time. There was a modest association between adenotonsillar size and OAHI in nonobese children (r = 0.22; p &lt; 0.001) but not in obese children. The mean (+/- SEM) adenotonsillar size was larger in nonobese children (3.85 +/- 0.16 vs 3.01 +/- 0.14, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001), and conversely Mallampati class scores were significantly higher in obese children (p &lt; 0.0001).
Isocyanate-induced asthmatic reactions were associated with a rise in sputum eosinophil levels at 24 h (p &lt; 0.01), and an increase in FeNO at 24 h (p &lt; 0.05) and 48 h (p &lt; 0.005), whereas FeNO level did not vary with isocyanate exposure in subjects with rhinitis and in control subjects. FeNO changes at 24 h positively correlated with corresponding sputum eosinophil changes (rho = 0.66, p &lt; 0.001). A rise in pH was observed in the afternoon samples of EBC, irrespective of the occurrence of isocyanate-induced asthmatic reactions.
The prevalence of emphysema in the IPF cohort was 28% (31 of 110 patients). IPF with emphysema was significantly associated with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7 to 773.7; p = 0.0003), and smoking (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.36 to 11.6; p = 0.004). Patients with IPF and emphysema had a higher mean (+/- SD) decrease in oxygen saturation during rest and exercise (16.3 +/- 6.7% vs 13.5 +/- 4.6%, respectively; p = 0.04), a higher mean fibrosis HRCT scan score (1.75 +/- 0.36 vs 1.55 +/- 0.38, respectively; p = 0.015), a higher eSPAP (82 +/- 20 vs 57 +/- 15 mm Hg, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001), and lower median survival time (25 vs 34 months, respectively; p = 0.01) than patients with IPF without emphysema. The Cox regression model showed that the two most important variables associated with mortality were FVC &lt; 50% predicted (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.19 to 5.68; p = 0.016) and eSPAP &gt;or= 75 mm Hg (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.54; p = 0.022).
Both PF-PCT and S-PCT levels were significantly higher in the PPPE group than the non-PPPE group (p = 0.01 and 0.0003, respectively). S-PCT had a better diagnostic performance than PF-PCT, with an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.834 for S-PCT and 0.752 for PF-PCT (p = 0.006). In the PPPE group, both PF-PCT and S-PCT levels on days 1 and 3 were significantly higher in patients who were in high-severity risk classes (all p values &lt; 0.05). Day 3 PF-PCT/S-PCT ratios were significantly lower in patients who needed chest tube drainage for &gt; 7.5 days (corrected p = 0.02).
Thirty-two studies (n = 1,105 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The mean number of participants and mean number of studies for each inflammatory outcome in the metaanalysis was 113.1 (SD, 46.2) and 3.5 (SD, 1.3), respectively. There was no effect of LABA therapy on sputum, BAL fluid, or mucosal inflammatory cells in adults or in children. LABA therapy decreased ENO levels and BAL fluid albumin levels in adults. In children, LABA therapy was associated with a small decrease in serum eosinophils and interleukin-4.
Low FEV(1) was associated with high SBPV in the HF domain. The mean SBPV-HFs were 5.2, 4.5, 4.1, and 3.8 mm Hg, respectively, in subjects with FEV(1) in the first (low), second, third, and fourth quartile (p &lt; 0.001 [for trend]). This relationship persisted after adjustments for potential confounding factors. Low VC was significantly associated with high SBPV-HF in the crude analysis but not after adjustment for confounding factors. Neither FEV(1) nor VC showed any significant relationship with BRS, HRV, or SBPV in the LF domain.
The median follow-up period was 34.4 months. The CVD-UIP group was younger, included more women and nonsmokers, and showed better survival than the IPF/UIP group. Pathologically, CVD-UIP patients had fewer fibroblastic foci and smaller honeycombing (HC) spaces with higher germinal centers and total inflammation scores than IPF/UIP patients. Radiologically, CVD-UIP patients had a lower emphysema score and more likely a nontypical UIP pattern without HC. The germinal centers score was the best distinguishing feature between CVD-UIP and IPF/UIP patients (odds ratio, 2.948; p = 0.001) and was marginally related to survival (p = 0.076). The HC score (hazard ratio [HR], 1.134; p &lt; 0.001), total lung capacity (TLC) [HR, 0.932; p = 0.004], and age (HR, 1.052; p = 0.017) were significant predictors of survival in all patients with UIP histology, regardless of the presence of CVD. Among IPF/UIP patients, those with positive autoantibodies were pathologically more similar to CVD-UIP than to IPF/UIP without autoantibodies, despite no difference in survival between them.
The mean age was 68 years (SD, 9 years), 93% were men, 43% were current smokers, and the mean postbronchodilator FEV(1) was 52% predicted (SD, 16% predicted). Multivariate linear regression models were built separately for each outcome variable and adjusted for potential confounders (including remaining outcomes if appropriate). When patients with the lowest quartile of physical activity were compared to patients in the other quartiles, physical activity was associated with significantly higher diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) [change in the second, third, and fourth quartiles of physical activity, compared with first quartile (+ 6%, + 6%, and + 9% predicted, respectively; p = 0.012 [for trend])], expiratory muscle strength (maximal expiratory pressure [Pemax]) [+ 7%, + 5%, and + 9% predicted, respectively; p = 0.081], 6-min walking distance (6MWD) [+ 40, + 41, and + 45 m, respectively; p = 0.006 (for trend)], and maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2)peak) [+ 55, + 185, and + 81 mL/min, respectively; p = 0.110 (for trend)]. Similarly, physical activity reduced the risk of having high levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (odds ratio, 0.78, 0.61, and 0.36, respectively; p = 0.011) and C-reactive protein (0.70, 0.51, and 0.52, respectively; p = 0.036) in multivariate logistic regression.
An estimated 539 million patients were discharged from hospitals between 1986 and 2005, of whom an estimated 312,411 had AIDS-associated PCP. The proportion of patients discharged from the hospital with AIDS-associated PCP decreased from 31% before the introduction of chemoprophylaxis (1986 to 1989) to 17% with chemoprophylaxis (1990 to 1995) and subsequently to 9% after the introduction of ART in 1996 (p &lt; 0.001). Mortality from AIDS-associated PCP decreased from 21 to 16% and subsequently to 7% between these three time periods (p &lt; 0.001). Among those who received mechanical ventilation, mortality decreased from 79% in the prechemoprophylaxis era to 31% in the ART era (p &lt; 0.001) alongside an increase (from 5 to 11%) in the use of mechanical ventilation. We also observed a shift in the population at-risk for PCP over time: a greater proportion of black people, women, and people from Southern states were affected (all p &lt; 0.001).
Among 4,320 patients (37.5%) with pulmonary hypertension (PH) [mean pulmonary artery pressure, &gt;or= 25 mm Hg], hemodynamic data were complete for 3,926 patients (90.9%). Of these, 580 patients (14.8%) met the criteria for PAH with a PCWP &lt;or= 15 mm Hg, but 310 of these patients (53.5%) had an LVEDP &gt; 15 mm Hg. Such discrepancies remained common among patients with a pulmonary vascular resistance &gt; 3 Wood units and those being catheterized specifically to evaluate PH. PCWP provided moderate discrimination between patients with high vs normal LVEDP (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 0.86) but was poorly calibrated to LVEDP (Bland-Altman limits of agreement, - 15.2 to 9.5 mm Hg; Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi(2) statistic, 155.4; p &lt; 0.0001).
Fifty-five patients (mean [+/- SEM] age, 55 +/- 2 years; 44 male patients, 11 female patients) with newly diagnosed moderate-to-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index &gt; 20 events/h) were studied before and after 6 months of nCPAP treatment. There was a significant reduction in CRP levels after nCPAP therapy (before nCPAP therapy, 0.23 +/- 0.03 mg/dL; after nCPAP therapy, 0.17 +/- 0.02 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, we divided these patients into two groups based on adherence to nCPAP therapy. A group of patients using nCPAP &gt; 4 h/d and &gt; 5 d/wk were designated as the good compliance group. The decrease in CRP concentration was significant (before nCPAP therapy, 0.23 +/- 0.04 mg/dL; after nCPAP therapy, 0.16 +/- 0.03 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.05) in the good compliance group but not in the poor compliance group (before nCPAP therapy, 0.24 +/- 0.05 mg/dL; after nCPAP therapy, 0.20 +/- 0.05 mg/dL; p = 0.21). Furthermore, we divided those patients into a high CRP group (&gt;/= 0.2 mg/dL) and a normal CRP group (&lt; 0.2 mg/dL) before nCPAP therapy. The significant decrease in CRP levels in the good compliance group was evident only in those patients with an initially elevated CRP level (before nCPAP therapy, 0.48 +/- 0.08 mg/dL; after nCPAP therapy, 0.29 +/- 0.06 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.05).
Higher postoperative soluble P-selectin levels were associated with an increased risk of PGD at 72 h after transplantation (odds ratio [OR] per 1 natural log increase in soluble P-selectin at 6 h after lung allograft reperfusion, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 11.8; p = 0.048) and at 24 h after lung allograft reperfusion (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.4 to 16.1; p = 0.01). Higher preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass were also associated with an increased risk of PGD.
Sixty-four percent of surrogates (n = 32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 77%) expressed doubt about the accuracy of physicians' futility predictions, 32% of surrogates (n = 16; 95% CI, 20 to 47%) elected to continue life support with a &lt; 1% survival estimate, and 18% of surrogates (n = 9; 95% CI, 9 to 31%) elected to continue treatment when the physician believed that the patient had no chance of survival. Surrogates with religious objections to the futility rationale (n = 18) were more likely to request continued life support (odds ratio, 4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 14.0; p = 0.03) than those with secular or experiential objections (n = 15; odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.4; p = 0.90).
Application of LPV resulted in an increase in QALYs gained by 15% (4.21 years for non-LPV vs 4.83 years for LPV), and an increase in lifetime costs of $7,233 per patient with ALI ($99,588 for non-LPV vs $106,821 for LPV). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for LPV were $22,566 per life saved at hospital discharge and $11,690 per QALY gained. The maximum, cost-effective, per patient investment in a hypothetical program to improve LPV adherence from 50 to 90% was $9,482. Results were robust to a wide range of economic and patient parameter assumptions.
There was a high degree of concordance between the shortened and standard AMP protocols (94%) and repeated shortened AMP protocols (100%). The mean log(10) PCs displayed a high degree of agreement for both AMP protocols, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.98) and 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 0.98), respectively.
The study cohort was made up of 212 patients with ALI complicating septic shock. Hospital mortality was statistically lowest for those achieving both AIFR and CLFM and higher for those achieving only CLFM, those achieving only AIFR, and those achieving neither (17 of 93 patients [18.3%] vs 13 of 31 patients [41.9%] vs 30 of 53 patients [56.6%] vs 27 of 35 [77.1%], respectively; p &lt; 0.001).
Over a 1-year period, we prospectively enrolled patients in three different immunosuppressed groups, as follows: 120 liver transplantation candidates (LTCs); 116 chronically HIV-infected persons; and 95 patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs). TST, TS.TB, and QFT-IT were simultaneously performed, their results were compared, and intertest agreement was evaluated. Overall, TST provided fewer positive results (10.9%) than TS.TB (18.4%; p &lt; 0.001) and QFT-IT (15.1%; p = 0.033). Significantly fewer HIV-infected individuals had at least one positive test (9.5%) compared with LTCs (35.8%; p &lt; 0.001) and patients with HMs (29.5%; p &lt; 0.001). Diagnostic agreement between tests was moderate (kappa = 0.40 to 0.65) and decreased in the HIV-infected group when the results of the TS.TB were compared with either TST (kappa = 0.16) or QFT-IT (kappa = 0.19). Indeterminate blood test results due to low positive control values were significantly more frequent with QFT-IT (7.2%) than with TS.TB (0.6%; p &lt; 0.001).
There were 7 type A, 15 type AB, 8 type B1, 5 type B2, 17 type B3 thymomas, and 8 thymic carcinomas. Seven patients (11.7%) died of the disease. Tumors recurred in eight patients (13.3%). Although p53 expression alone was found to be correlated with RFS with borderline significance (p = 0.056), patients with Src-positive and p53-positive coexpression had a shorter OS time than the other groups (p &lt; 0.008). Cytoplasmic expression of survivin was present in 5 of 60 thymic neoplasms (8.3%), 4 of which were thymic carcinomas that all recurred.
The mean (+/- SE) concentration of total bile acids in tracheal aspirates was 6.2 +/- 2.1 and 1.1 +/- 0.4 mumol/L/g sputum, respectively, for patients with and without VAP (p &lt; 0.05). The interleukin (IL)-8 level was significantly higher in the VAP group (p &lt; 0.05). The major bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, stimulated alveolar epithelial cells to increase IL-8 production at both the messenger RNA and protein level through p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. The selective p38 and JNK inhibitors, as well as dexamethasone, successfully inhibited IL-8 production.
After adjustment for comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, asthma/other chronic lung disease, and depression), an increased risk of lost workdays was found in employees in whom sleep apnea developed compared to control subjects (rate ratio [RR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 2.09 in men; and RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.43 to 2.28 in women). In women, the excess risk was already pronounced 5 years prior to the year of diagnosis, whereas in men the highest risk was noticed 1 year before the year of diagnosis.
Spirometry was performed in 5,314 subjects. There were 759 subjects with airflow limitation; of these, 18.2% reported ever having had an exacerbation, 7.9% reported having an exacerbation, and 6.2% reported having an exacerbation requiring at least a doctor visit within the past year. The proportion of individuals with an exacerbation significantly increased by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages, from 4.2% in stage 1 to 28.9% in stages 3 and 4. The self-reported exacerbation rate was 0.58 exacerbations per year. The rate of exacerbations requiring at least a doctor visit and length of stay in hospital due to exacerbations also increased as COPD severity progressed. The factors associated with having an exacerbation in the past year were dyspnea, prior asthma diagnosis, receiving any respiratory therapy, and disease severity of GOLD stages 3 and 4.
The grouped coefficients of determination were APACHE IV with coefficients recalibrated to the LOS values of the study cohort (APACHE IVrecal) [R(2) = 0.422], mortality probability model III at zero hours (MPM(0) III) [R(2) = 0.279], and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) [R(2) = 0.008]. For each decile of predicted ICU LOS, the mean predicted LOS vs the observed LOS was significantly different (p &lt;or= 0.05) for three, two, and six deciles using APACHE IVrecal, MPM(0) III, and SAPS II, respectively. Plots of the predicted vs the observed LOS ratios of the hospitals revealed a threefold variation in LOS among hospitals with high model correlations.
Fourteen trials were identified (nine trials that examined NMES in CHF patients, and five in COPD patients). PEDro scores for methodological quality of the trials were generally moderate to good. Many of the studies reported significant improvements in muscle strength, exercise capacity, and/or health status.
The prevalence of DM and MetS significantly increased as predicted FVC decreased (p &lt; 0.01). Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates (per 1,000 person-years) increased in a stepwise manner as predicted FVC decreased in those patients with neither MetS nor DM (3.5 to 8.0), MetS (4.1 to 8.1), and DM (9.9 to 13.3). Compared to those with high FVC, those with low FVC had more than a fourfold increase in mortality among those with MetS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 11.45; p &lt; 0.01) and more than a twofold increase among those with neither disease (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.06 to 5.43; p &lt; 0.05). Also, every 10% reduction in FVC was associated with a 77% higher mortality (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.37; p &lt; 0.05) among persons with MetS. However, in those with DM, FVC did not contribute further to mortality risk.
Almost 92% of the surveys were returned. Eighty percent of teens' parents reported purchasing lenses after the study, vs. 63% of the children's parents (p=0.02). Symptoms reported at the last study visit were not significantly associated with future purchase, though there was a trend towards more light sensitivity in those who did not purchase more contact lenses (23.1% vs. 11.8%). Satisfaction with contact lenses was high among both those purchasing additional contact lenses and those who did not. Both children and teens reported similar frequencies of symptoms such as burning, itching or tearing eyes 3 months following study completion. Teens reported having contact-lens-related dry eyes more frequently than children.
The median duration of problems encountered with previous lenses was 4 years (range 0.5-10 years). The median visual acuity with the S-LIM lens was 6/9 (range 6/5-6/24). A median of 1 diagnostic lens (range 1-3 lenses) was required to achieve a satisfactory fit. At the last recorded follow-up, 10 patients (14 eyes) had no clinically observable problem and were wearing their lenses with a median wearing time of 8h per day (range 1-18 h). The median duration of follow up was 6 months (range 2-18 months). One patient (1 eye) abandoned lens wear because of satisfactory unaided vision.
Significant reductions in cellular ATP content were observed at 40% solution and above with both MPS B and MPS D, compared to at 100% only for MPS A and MPS C, and similar results were obtained in BCEpiC. Effects on resazurin reduction were also less in HCEpiC exposed to increasing doses of MPS A and MPS C than in cells exposed to MPS B and MPS D. After 15 min, HCEpiC viability measured by both resazurin reduction and cellular ATP levels was significantly lower for cells exposed to MPS B, MPS D, and MPS C, while HCEpiC exposed to MPS A were not affected. MPS B and MPS D reduced cell viability more than MPS A and MPS C over a 2-h time course in both HCEpiC and BCEpiC.
The mechanisms underlying the organ-protective effects of inhalational anaesthetics continue to be further unravelled. The main challenge, however, is to determine the clinical importance of these protective effects and their potential benefits for patients. Initial observations in cardiac surgery are encouraging, and the first clinical studies on other organ systems are being published. Noble gases share these organ-protective properties and may provide an additional tool for this purpose both in situations in which anaesthesia is needed (xenon) or in cases in which anaesthesia is not necessary (helium).
Recent studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone are dependent on age of the patient and therefore individual titration of the dose is necessary, especially in the elderly. Oxycodone has good oral bioavailability and it produces more predictable plasma concentrations than morphine, which has a poor and more variable bioavailability. Oxycodone has clinically significant drug interactions with drugs affecting cytochrome P450 3A enzymes. Clinical studies have demonstrated that oxycodone is a useful opioid analgesic in acute postoperative pain, cancer pain, visceral pain and chronic nonmalignant pain.
Gantacurium (with a pharmacodynamic profile similar to that of succinylcholine) and AV002 (with an intermediate duration of action) have shown efficacy in animals and, for gantacurium, in humans. Animal data have shown that exogenous administration of the amino acid cysteine accelerates the natural chemical degradation of both gantacurium and AV002 via the cysteine adduction pathway. Another reversal drug, sugammadex (a modified gamma-cyclodextrin and the first selective relaxant binding agent), forms very tight complexes in a 1: 1 ratio with steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents.
The pharmacokinetic models focused on incorporating covariate, especially age for pediatric-geriatric use, and altered physiological states. The pharmacodynamic models studied the effect of rate of anesthetic administration, age, experimental conditions, and delay within the monitor on estimation of drug concentration in the biophase. Models for the surrogate measure of the components of general anesthesia, hypnosis (bispectral index scale, entropy), immobility (limb tetanic stimulus-induced withdrawal reflex) and antinociception (surgical stress index, skin conductance algesimeter) were developed and validated. Response surface models were used to study drug interactions for important end-points during surgery and also to optimize dosing of anesthetic agents to maximize the desired/undesired effect ratio. The models for target-controlled infusions were improved by incorporating more covariates, and the closed-loop system was refined by using adaptive controllers that individualize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters to the particular patient by using Bayesian, Kalman filters, fuzzy logic or neural networks.
Gene association studies should ideally be conducted in highly phenotyped populations of homogenous ethnic admixture with identified associations adjusted for patient demographics, risk factors and medications. Patients' phenotype responses to opiates are the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental variables. Although most pharmacogenetic studies to date have assessed the association between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms that exist within selected single gene regions (e.g. opioid receptor mu-1, catechol-O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450 2D6) and opiate effects, more recent studies have begun to assess the potential influences of gene-gene interactions.
Anesthesia outside the operating room continues to be a challenging field. With the advances in surgical and anesthetic technology, there is an increasing need for research in the area of office-based anesthetic techniques and for improvement in terms of adherence to safety standards in aiming to decrease morbidity and mortality and increase patient satisfaction.
Several controlled studies now suggest that levosimendan is efficacious in improving hemodynamics in patients after cardiac surgery. Its use as an adjunct to catecholamines instead of phosphodiesterase inhibitors can be recommended in patients with postcardiotomy heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Prophylactic administration before cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with compromised ventricular function may also be rational because levosimendan facilitates weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass without inotropes with higher myocardial oxygen cost of inotropy. This mode of administration also seems to attenuate troponin release and spares treatment resources such as duration of postoperative ventilation and ICU stay. The reported experience in patients with noncardiac surgery is meager but previous results obtained from nonsurgical patients should be largely applicable. The use of levosimendan in treating septic myocardial depression or sepsis syndrome is a promising option but remains investigational for today.
Cardiovascular diseases are often combined with severe comorbidities such as renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonal hypertension and cerebrovascular damage. So anesthesia in this cohort requires experience, especially when during direct manipulation of the cardiac system such as in cardiologic procedures. Additionally, a new therapeutic option has been developed for valvular dysfunction recently, which involves the anesthesiologist in a new treatment of a high-risk population.
Compared with operating room claims, remote location claims involved older and sicker patients (P &lt; 0.01), with 50% of remote location claims involving monitored anesthesia care. The proportion of claims for death was increased in remote location claims [54 vs. 29% (operating room claims), P &lt; 0.001]. Respiratory damaging events were more common in remote location claims (44 vs. 20%, P &lt; 0.001), with inadequate oxygenation/ventilation the most common specific event (21 vs. 3% in operating room claims, P &lt; 0.001). Remote location claims were more often judged as being preventable by better monitoring (32 vs. 8% for operating room claims, P &lt; 0.001).
Propofol use by nonanesthesiologists remains a contraindication in the package insert of propofol in most countries. Sedation guidelines produced by the American Society of Gastroenterology partially contradict those produced by the American Society of Anesthesiologists for sedation by nonanesthesiologists, whereas the German guidelines were developed with anesthesiologists involved. The use of fospropofol, recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for sedation, is considered an alternative to propofol by some gastroenterologists. Methodological errors in earlier pharmacological studies have to be solved before widespread use of fospropofol is justified, however. Our simulations show that dosing protocols with small boluses administered at reasonable intervals induce less respiratory depression than large boluses. Interindividual variability of propofol-induced respiratory depression is illustrated by different pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameter sets used in the simulation. Two computer-assisted propofol infusion systems are currently being investigated. They not only incorporate the target effect but also the side effects, which may limit respiratory depression.
Patients with PDNV require a longer recovery time to resume normal activities. PDNV can delay discharge from postanesthesia care units and is one of the leading causes of unexpected hospital admission after planned outpatient surgery. New data indicate that the incidence of PDNV is higher than expected and therefore we need a model that allows us to identify patients at risk for PDNV. A PDNV prediction model will help clinicians to better identify patients at risk who might benefit from long-acting antiemetics such as transdermal scopolamine, aprepitant, and/or palonosetron.
Two large database studies have helped to define the frequency and nature of adverse events in pediatric sedation/anesthesia practice from a multispecialty perspective. A number of papers describing respiratory and hemodynamic aspects of dexmedetomidine sedation have also been published. Finally, a number of studies relating to training sedation providers, reporting of sedation adverse events, sedation for vulnerable populations, and (in particular) ketamine sedation adverse respiratory events have also come to light.
In a prospective study, the PON1 192QQ genotype and low PON1 activity were associated with increased systemic oxidative stress and increased risk for CVD. PON1 expression protected against Pseudomonas aeruginosa lethality in Drosophila, suggesting that PON1 can interfere with quorum sensing in vivo. PON2 attenuated macrophage triglyceride accumulation via inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1. Overexpression of PON2 protected against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis when the stress was induced by interference with protein modification but not when endoplasmic reticulum stress was induced by Ca2+ deregulation.
Data from a series of recent studies, including Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin, Measuring Effective Reductions in Cholesterol Using Rosuvastatin Therapy II, Treating to New Targets-Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering and Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study, demonstrating that apoB better identifies residual risk than non-HDL-C will be reviewed.
Eight different genetic loci, including 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferase 2, Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy 2, caveolin 1, lamin A/C, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, v-AKT murine thymoma oncogene homolog 2, zinc metalloprotease and lipase maturation factor 1 have been described linked to different lipodystrophy syndromes. Mutations in these genes may cause fat loss and dyslipidemia through multiple mechanisms, which remain fully elucidated; however, they may involve defects in development and differentiation of adipocytes, and premature death and apoptosis of adipocytes. Hypertriglyceridemia is a consequence of increased VLDL synthesis from the liver, which is also loaded by ectopic triglyceride deposition, reduced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or both. A recent study in mice with Agpat2 deficiency reports marked reduction in serum triglyceride upon feeding a fat-free diet, which suggests that low-fat diets are likely to be beneficial in lipodystrophic patients. Leptin replacement therapy is also a promising therapeutic option for lipodystrophic patients with hypoleptinemia.
Treatment strategies need to be different in those patients with lipoatrophy when compared with patients with central fat accumulation (lipohypertrophy). Most of the treatments studied have produced minimal or modest effects, which are not sustained when the therapy is discontinued. The treatment of associated metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia should have similar goals to that in the non-HIV population, but is complicated by the fact that response may be worse and there is a need to consider drug-drug interactions with the antiretrovirals.
Niacin treatment reduces cardiovascular events and the progression of atherosclerosis. Identification of G-protein-coupled receptor 109A as the receptor for nicotinic acid has provided insights into how treatment with this compound leads to a favourable alteration in HDL cholesterol. In addition, evidence of nonlipid-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of nicotinic acid such as direct enhancement of adiponectin secretion demonstrates a novel atheroprotective role.
The renal dyslipidemia is characterized by accumulation of intact and partially metabolized triglyceride-rich apoB-containing and apoC-containing lipoproteins. Increased concentrations of atherogenic apoC-III rich lipoproteins, the hallmark of renal dyslipidemia, may result from disturbances of insulin metabolism and action in chronic kidney disease. Novel findings strongly suggest that apoC-III triggers a cascade of pro-inflammatory events, which ultimately can result in endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage. Disappointingly, recently reported intervention trials with statins have failed to show any benefit on cardiovascular disease in patients with advanced renal failure.
Contrary to prevailing views, recent studies demonstrate that the long-term within-individual variability of triglyceride measurements is similar to that of other lipid fractions. Several prospective studies have reported on associations of circulating triglyceride levels with coronary heart disease risk, but it remains unclear whether observed associations are dependent on levels of conventional risk factors (especially other lipids) or are importantly modified under different circumstances (especially by fasting status). Ongoing large-scale studies should help clarify such outstanding uncertainties and assess whether measurement of triglyceride levels can better identify individuals at increased risk of coronary heart disease than measurement of conventional risk factors alone. Available interventions that lower levels of triglycerides are unable to judge causality as such interventions typically influence levels of several lipid fractions. Study of genetic variants that regulate triglyceride levels may provide an alternative approach to assess causality.
Genetic association studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the PPARD gene have only provided negative or conflicting evidence for gross phenotypes such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes. This does not exclude more subtle effects in skeletal muscle metabolic function, but studies of this type need replication. A couple of recent studies using the specific PPARdelta agonist GW501516 suggest potent hypolipidaemic actions, presumably caused by enhanced fat oxidation in skeletal muscle.
There is increasing evidence from both animal and human studies linking low PON1 activity to an increased likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Two prospective studies reported a significantly lower incidence of major cardiovascular events in participants with the highest systemic PON1 activity, compared with those with the lowest activity.
Studies of body fat distribution, insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and dyslipidaemia in Alström syndrome will be discussed as well as genotypic and phenotypic variation in the syndrome in the context of recent metabolic studies in insulin resistance. Potential therapies including low-carbohydrate diet, niaspan and incretins will be considered.
For a long time atherosclerosis was regarded as a lipid-driven disease, but now it is evident that it also involves the simultaneous and combined effect of inflammation and immunological pathways. The secreted PLA2s and the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) have been associated with atherogenesis and its complications. These two enzymes produce biologically active metabolites that are involved in several phases of the atherosclerosis process.
We describe the current classification of cerebellar ataxias and underline the recent discoveries in molecular pathogenesis. Cerebellar disorders can be divided into sporadic forms and inherited diseases. Inherited ataxias include autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias/spinocerebellar ataxia) and episodic ataxias, and X-linked ataxias. From a motor control point of view, the leading theories of ataxia are based on neural representations or 'internal models' to emulate fundamental natural processes such as body motion.
The range of clinical features in myoclonic dystonia has been extended and its underlying pathophysiology better defined. The diverse causes leading to jerky tremor and orthostatic myoclonus have been clarified and the need to consider drugs as potential causes highlighted. In patients with combined myoclonus and epilepsy, the major advance has been in our understanding of the natural history of these conditions, which can be more benign than hitherto thought. Finally, the new condition of primary progressive myoclonus of ageing has been identified, although it remains to be seen whether this is a pathological entity or not.
Several imaging-disorder correlations place the technique itself on a stronger footing by showing good agreement between in-vivo and histological measures of beta-amyloid deposition. Correlations between beta-amyloid and other measures of dementia - cognition, brain atrophy, and glucose metabolism - appear to support a view that beta-amyloid triggers a host of downstream alterations that are closely related to dementia severity and progression. However, associations between PET measures of beta-amyloid and cognition are generally fairly weak. The implications for clinical use are still uncertain. It seems likely that amyloid imaging will be useful for differentiating dementias associated with beta-amyloid from those that are not, but the utility of this approach will depend on the availability of effective beta-amyloid-directed treatments. Similarly, amyloid imaging offers the potential for predicting which nondemented individuals will eventually develop Alzheimer's disease, although here again the measurement of downstream beta-amyloid effects may be important.
The reported advantage of using a dopamine agonist as an initial treatment to prevent the development of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease appears to be less evident after a long-term follow-up. Other factors, related to the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease or to patients' endophenotypes, are beginning to be identified. Several brain changes have been found to be associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesias. PET studies have evidenced an increased level of synaptic dopamine in the striatum. Neurophysiological studies have suggested that dyskinesias might reflect abnormal skill memorization processes within the cortico-subcortical loops. A dysfunction of the mechanisms trying to compensate for dopamine deficiency and its brain consequences could be responsible for these changes induced by the dopaminergic treatment. Bilateral pallidal stimulation has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for severe tardive dyskinesias.
Over the past few years, ASL technology has improved considerably and the utility of ASL perfusion MRI as a diagnostic and research tool has been demonstrated. This review briefly covers ASL methodologies and clinical applications, while expanding on the use of ASL in human neuroscience research to elucidate patterns of resting brain function that correlate with genotype or phenotype (trait effects), or in response to exogenous manipulations of brain function with pharmacological agents or psychological tasks (state effects).
The subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's disease patients is characterized by oscillatory activity in the beta-frequency (approximately 15 Hz) range. However, Parkinson's disease tremor is not strictly correlated with the abnormal synchronous oscillations of the basal ganglia. On the other hand, akinesia and rigidity are better correlated with the basal ganglia beta oscillations.
Complex network properties have been identified with some consistency in all modalities of neuroimaging data and over a range of spatial and time scales. Conserved properties include small worldness, high efficiency of information transfer for low wiring cost, modularity, and the existence of network hubs. Structural and functional network metrics have been found to be heritable and to change with normal aging. Clinical studies, principally in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, have identified abnormalities of network configuration in patients. Future work will likely involve efforts to synthesize structural and functional networks in integrated models and to explore the interdependence of network configuration and cognitive performance.
The rise in availability of MRI for detecting disorders in the living brain has made it an attractive technology for assessing neural structure and function in a number of prominent diseases. Geographic factors underlying diseased populations coupled with complementary neuroimaging research programs have led to an increase in multicenter neuroimaging trials and consortia. Neuroimaging has become a major focus for multiinstitutional research in progressive changes in brain architecture, proxy biomarkers of treatment response, and the effects of disease on patterns of cognitive activation and connectivity. Notable consortia and research trial studies have focused on Alzheimer's disease, pediatric brain cancer, and fetal alcohol syndrome, in addition to multiinstitutional collaborative programs for mapping the normal brain. Such large-scale efforts necessitate close coordination of image data collection protocols, ontology development, computational requirements, concerted data archiving, and sharing.
From neurophysiological studies and animal models, converging arguments support the role of combined corticostriatal, cerebellar and dopaminergic dysfunctions in the pathophysiology of dystonia. A large study in epidemiology identified several risk factors associated with writer's cramp (time spent handwriting each day and the additional burden of an abrupt increase in the writing time in the year before onset). Important studies on the abnormal structure-function relationship in hereditary and sporadic dystonia explored the relationship between genotype, phenotype and endophenotype.
Mapping of a single receptor type can already reveal borders of functionally and cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical regions. The combined mapping of various receptors in each cortical area (receptor fingerprint) represents the balance between different neurotransmitter systems and often reveals hitherto unknown parcellations. Different brain regions are identified as parts of distinct functional systems.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated altered blood flow in conversion disorders that may reflect changes in synaptic activity. Electrophysiological testing shows limitations in distinguishing between psychogenic and organic propriospinal myoclonus and dystonia. Recent evidence cautions against the uncritical acceptance of all cases of posttraumatic myoclonus and 'jumpy stump' as being organic in nature. 'Essential palatal tremor' is recognized as a rather heterogeneous group of tremors that includes psychogenic tremor. Two recent studies evaluating the long-term prognosis of psychogenic tremor differ in the degree of unfavorable outcome. Different groups of PMDs might have distinctive gait characteristics with prognostic, diagnostic, or therapeutic value. Two recent reviews provide comprehensive information on the understudied area of PMDs in children.
A widespread dynamic network of cortical and subcortical oscillators taking part in tremor generation intermittently has been postulated. Essential tremor is accompanied by functional deficits but may also occur along with subtle cerebellar changes. According to recent epidemiological studies there may be a link of essential tremor with Parkinson's disease. Many of the epidemiologic studies suffer from small cohorts, small effects or the lack of a definite test for essential tremor leaving the diagnosis a pure clinical one. A very recent large genome-wide association study has revealed that the LINGO1 gene is associated with an increased risk for essential tremor. Topiramate is becoming the best-established second line treatment for essential tremor. Targets for deep brain stimulation in the grey matter below the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus seem to be most effective.
DTI provided new dimensions for the characterization of white matter anatomy. This characterization of the white matter can be roughly divided into two categories. First, the white matter can be parcellated into constituent white matter tracts, based on pixel-by-pixel orientation and anisotropy information. Second, the DTI information can be extrapolated to obtain three-dimensional connectivity information. Based on these capabilities of DTI, many new image analysis tools are being developed to investigate the status of the white matter.
For all injured teeth and all splints, there was a significant splint effect for the vertical and horizontal dimensions (P &lt; 0.05). For injured teeth, the composite splints produced the largest changes in vertical tooth mobility; wire-composite splints 1 and 2, using orthodontic wires, produced the smallest vertical splint effects. For uninjured teeth, the Schuchardt 1 splint and the bracket splint produced the largest splint effects; wire-composite splints 1 and 2 produced only a slight change in tooth mobility. Composite splints 2 and 3 produced the largest horizontal splint effects for injured teeth, and the 4 composite splints produced the largest horizontal splint effects for uninjured teeth. The most horizontally flexible splints were the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2.
According to the Gross Motor Function Classification, the SG presented 34.0% of individuals that walked with or without assistive mobility devices and 66.0% required a wheelchair for mobility. The TDI prevalence observed for CG was 32.0% (n = 32), with 20.0% (n = 20) for SG, showing no statistically significant difference (P = 0.053). For both groups, the teeth most affected were the maxillary central incisors. Crown fracture without pulp exposure was the most frequent type of injury (31.2%) in CG and enamel fracture (30.0%), in SG. The groups differed significantly regarding dental treatment received after TDI (P = 0.012), with CG presenting higher percentages of treated individuals
The results of the 479 returned questionnaires were analyzed. The difference between questionnaires before and after the lecture was statistically analyzed by the Wilcoxon test. There was statistically significant change in the performance of professional groups after information was provided (P &lt; 0.0001).
Images of any pathologic preparation could be captured and sent over the mobile phone with an MMS, without being limited by appropriate access to the internet for transmission (i.e. access to broad-band services). The quality of the image was not influenced by the brand or model of the mobile-phone used, but only by its digital resolution, with any resolution above 0.8 megapixel resulting in images sufficient for diagnosis.Access to MMS services is increasingly reaching remote disadvantaged areas. Current penetration of the service in Africa was mapped appearing already available in almost every country, with penetration index varying from 1.5% to 92.2%.
We generated 76 criteria in five domains; physical environment, learning environment, tutor characteristics, patient involvement and departmental responsibilities. Stakeholders' views differed concerning the merits of criteria and which should take greatest priority. None felt that developing such a list was inappropriate. They proposed no new criteria to add to those identified in the Delphi process.
The registrars who completed the extra year felt better prepared for independent practice than their counterparts who had completed the traditional shorter scheme, due mainly to an increased sense of professional confidence, a broader experience of different practice approaches, a greater knowledge of practice management and the additional career guidance received during their final year. Trainers and registrars described a different type of training relationship in the fourth year. The relationship could be described as more one of mentorship than a traditional trainer-trainee relationship. The customized design of the year provided an easier transition into independent practice than the sudden change experienced in the traditional programme but trainers felt that the flexibility offered could create unrealistic expectations of the reality of finding time for continued learning in general practice. Future research is suggested including followup studies of extended programmes to assess whether the apparent benefits detected in this study influence subsequent personal and practice development. It would also be valuable to explore the effects of the extended programme on the other stakeholders such as the programme directing team, the patients and other training practice team members.
Here, we use a methylation profiling strategy that is predominantly responsive to methylation differences outside of CpG islands. The method compares the yield from two samples of size-selected fragments generated by a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. We then profile nine different normal tissues from two human donors relative to spleen using a custom array of genomic clones covering the euchromatic portion of human chromosome 1 and representing 8% of the human genome. We observe gross regional differences in methylation states across chromosome 1 between tissues from the same individual, with the most striking differences detected in the comparison of cerebellum and spleen. Profiles of the same tissue from different donors are strikingly similar, as are the profiles of different lobes of the brain. Comparing our results with published gene expression levels, we find that clones exhibiting extreme ratios reflecting low relative methylation are statistically enriched for genes with high expression ratios, and vice versa, in most pairs of tissues examined.
The duration of signal disturbance by electric cautery was 12.6 +/- 4.2 min in the BIS and 3.9 +/- 1.8 min in the cerebral state monitor (P &lt; 0.05) for 9.5 +/- 4.3 min duration of electric cautery. The recovery time from disturbance by electric cautery was 37 +/- 12 s in the BIS and 4 +/- 2 s in the cerebral state monitor (P &lt; 0.05). The absolute values of the BIS and CSI were not significantly different. Both BIS and CSI decreased significantly when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration increased from 0.5 to 1.0%, but did not significantly change when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration increased from 1.0 to 1.5%. The BIS and CSI correlated well. The Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the BIS and CSI.
Patients with 0.1 or 0.2 mg morphine showed a significant reduction in opioid requests compared with placebo during 72 h after surgery (P = 0.0001). At 24 h after surgery, the rate of patients who required additional opioid analgesia was 71% in the placebo group, 51% in the 0.1 mg morphine group and 31% of the patients in the 0.2 mg morphine group. After 0.2 mg morphine, systemic opioid requirements at 24 h were significantly lower than those in patients with 0.1 mg morphine (P &lt; 0.05). Intrathecal morphine was not associated with an increased frequency of respiratory depression. Forty per cent of patients with intrathecal morphine did not ask for systemic opioids.
Both S(+)-ketamine and racemic(+/-)-ketamine, with similar potencies and efficacies and in a concentration-dependent manner, relaxed the precontracted arterial rings. However, AP-5 neither relaxed the arteries nor affected the vasodilatory actions of ketamine. N-methyl-D-aspartate and glutamate (0.01-1 mmol l) had negligible effects on isometric tension under the resting or precontracted condition.
Although haemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation did not differ between the groups, the duration of intubation was significantly shortened in the Endoflex groups in both studies.
There were no significant differences in the time course of blood glucose levels during operation and postoperative period between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). There was no hypoglycaemic episode in the perioperative period and no significant differences in potassium levels between the two groups.
We found a positive correlation in changes of 'physical independence' and 'extroversion' (r = 0.20; P = 0.010) and 'intellect' (r = 0.18; P = 0.021) on postoperative days 1 and 7. These correlations were not observed on postoperative day 14. With regard to the change between days 7 and 14, correlations were found between 'physical interdependence' and 'agreeableness' and between 'physical interdependence' and 'conscientiousness' (r = -0.17; P = 0.028-0.030 for both).
The response rate was 73% (451/621). Preoperative evaluation included a recent platelet count in 97% of responding units, and information was given to patients in 84% of cases. Antibiotic prophylaxis in accordance with French guidelines was used in 78% of units. Anaesthetic techniques were single-shot spinal, epidural, combined spinal epidural and general anaesthesia in decreasing order (92.5, 4.5, 2 and 1%, respectively). Effervescent cimetidine was the first choice in 62% of units. Cricoid pressure and succinylcholine were routinely used in 66 and 77% of units, respectively. Oxytocin was used appropriately in 65% of units. In addition to spinal or epidural opioids, paracetamol, NSAIDs and nefopam were added postoperatively in 98, 68 and 19% of units, respectively. Poorer practices were found in units having a lower annual delivery rate.
No significant difference in total morphine consumption between groups was detectable. The proportion of patients who did not receive any morphine in the postoperative period was significantly higher in group para (42%) than in group plac (4%). Ambulation was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) earlier in group para (4.0 +/- 0.2 h) than in groups meta (4.6 +/- 0.2 h) and plac (5.5 +/- 1.0 h). No differences were observed between groups meta and plac. There were no differences between groups with regard to incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting or changes in vigilance.
Shunting was necessary in eight patients, following clinical signs of a neurological deficit during clamping. In these patients, a significant reduction in TCD values and regional cerebral saturation values from baseline was recorded. We observed a drastic reduction in TCD values in four patients during clamping (6 +/- 5 versus 41 +/- 4 cm s) that was not associated with any neurological deficit or reduction in regional cerebral saturation values (51 +/- 4 versus 54 +/- 7%). Instrumental detection of a neurological deficit anticipated the clinical observation of about 5-10 s.
Our success rate was 62% (52/84 blocks) when using ultrasound to guide needle placement. The average distance from skin to target point at the transverse process was 76 mm (SD, 15 mm). Skin-target depth was significantly different between L4 and L5 on both sides (P = 0.01). The needle advancement could not be tracked to the target. The verbal rating scale scores before, immediately after, and 24 hrs after the procedure were 7.1 (SD, 2.4), 4.3 (SD, 3.1), and 3.8 (SD, 2.7), respectively. The average radiation dose was 0.226 mGy/m2 (SD, 0.196 mGy/m2).
Four hundred and ninety-seven CVCs were inserted by emergency medical services physicians during the study period in patients with various underlying diseases [cardiac arrest (35.4%), other cardiac emergencies (16.3%), trauma (30.0%), coma (7.7%)]. Subclavian and internal jugular veins were accessed in 55.3 and 44.15% of patients, respectively. The mean number of attempts was 1.3 and the mean time spent for insertion was 2.0+/-0.5 min. Eleven (2.2%) hematomas at the insertion site of minor clinical importance and five (1.0%) uncomplicated arterial punctures were found. All of the 378 patients referred alive for admission in hospitals after prehospital resuscitation had radiological detection of their CVCs. Catheter malposition occurred in 11 (2.9%) cases. Three pneumothoraces were also detected (0.8%), but only one required chest tube placement.
One hundred sixty-five patients were included, 146 patients (88.5%) responded to the telephone follow-up. We found high levels of satisfaction in the ED (89.7%). Highest satisfaction rate (92.5%) was for reception. Lower satisfaction rates were reported for waiting times (72.6%) and medical information provided by physicians (71.9%). The mean total time spent was 149.9 min (median=133.5). In multivariate analysis, waiting time was the unique independent determinant of patient dissatisfaction: second quartile odds ratio (OR)=0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI)=(0.06-2.66), third quartile OR=1.45; 95% CI=(0.32-6.47), last quartile OR=2.69; 95% CI=(0.65-11.08); ptrend=0.04.
In 64% of the cases, initial assessment by admission staff corresponded with the final assessment by the ED physician. Concordance was, however, poor (kappa=0.23). Underestimation of the severity occurred in 7.5% of cases without severe or lethal consequences. Ninety-four percent of patients were treated in the unit to which they were originally triaged by the admission staff.
A total of 420 family members were surveyed. Most participants (66.4%) stated that they would like to be present during resuscitation. The most common reason for wanting to be present during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was: 'providing support for the patient' and 'witnessing the intervention'. Male family members and family members of patients without health insurance were more likely to want to witness resuscitation. Although prior willingness to witness CPR did not affect the likelihood of wanting to witness CPR, those family members who had previously witnessed CPR ending in death had decreased likelihood of wanting to witness it again. The participants' age, level of education, marital status, presence of chronic illness, and the patients' presenting diagnosis did not significantly affect the rate of willingness to witness CPR.
Since the creation of SAGEC 67, more than 300 physicians have found the use of its baseline helpful, especially to avoid problems linked to the fact that emergency departments are overloaded most of the time.
Of the 572 patients (846 eyes) recruited during the study, approximately 50% of the eyes had at least one CL-related complication. Rigid gas permeable (GP) CLs had a statistically lower (P&lt;0.01) average number of complications (0.54 +/- 0.68) than soft contact lenses (SCLs) (0.85 +/- 0.82). Papillae and giant papillary conjunctivitis were the most prevalent complications in both GP and SCL wearers. Silicone SCLs (0.79 +/- 0.76) had a slightly lower, although not statistically different (P=0.23), rate of complication than nonsilicone SCLs (0.90 +/- 0.87). Although not statistically significant (P=0.29), extended wear CL use had a higher complication rate (0.93 +/- 0.84) compared with daily wear (0.73 +/- 0.79). Use of "other" solution, including generic and private label solutions, had the highest rate of complications for both SCLs (1.11 +/- 1.27) and GPs (0.96 +/- 0.93) compared with name brand solutions.
No statistically significant differences were found between countries for pairwise comparisons (P&lt;0.02, McNemar test, adjusted for multiple comparisons). No statistically significant differences were found within each country between observed and expected values for grades from Germany and Australia (P&gt;0.05, chi test); however, a statistically significant difference was found for the United States (P&lt;0.05, chi test).
ProKera was most commonly used in patients with corneal neovascularization with or without limbal stem-cell deficiency (10 eyes). Other indications included recurrent pterygium or pseudopterygium (three eyes), anophthalmic orbit contraction (two eyes), persistent epithelial defects (two eyes), severe thinning in a corneal ulcer (one eye), benign hereditary intraepithelial dyskeratosis (one eye), and band keratopathy (one eye). The mean duration of ProKera retention was 25.3 days (range, 0-125) visual acuity improved in 12 eyes (60%). Immediate adverse events included residual epithelial defects after removal (five eyes) and spontaneous extrusion of the implant (four eyes). Six patients (30%) reported eye pain or headache and four eyes (20%) had recurrence of the primary pathology.
Preoperative best corrected visual acuity was 20/80 in the right and 20/120 in the left eye. Patient gained a best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 in both the eyes, with a bilateral stable PCIOL and clear cornea.
Six months after DSAEK, none of the eyes had clinically significant interface haze (i.e., haze affecting quantity or quality of vision) at slit lamp. The mean best spectacle corrected visual acuity was 0.18 +/- 0.12 (range 0-0.4) logMAR (Snellen 20/30). The CM revealed highly reflective particles in interface in six eyes, particles with mild surrounding increased reflectivity in four eyes, and no discernible interface in three eyes. The mean particles density at interface was 28.6 +/- 23.4 particles/mm. No significant keratocyte activation was seen in any case at the interface. The mean anterior stromal reflectivity was 431.2 +/- 269.1 confocal back scatter units (CBU) and the mean interface reflectivity was 65.9 +/- 46.9 CBU. The mean anterior stromal reflectivity was significantly greater than the mean interface reflectivity (P&lt;0.01). Significant keratocyte activation with high reflectivity was seen in superficial anterior stroma in 8 of 13 eyes.
One hundred seventeen patients were included in this study: 21 contact lens wearers and 96 non-contact lens wearers. Contact lens wearers were found to have a higher median recurrence rate (0.4 episodes/year) compared with non-contact lens wearers (0.2 episodes/year) (P=0.02). A multivariate regression evaluating factors predictive of the number of recurrences found that contact lens use remained a significant predictive variable (P=0.02) when accounting for patient demographic and disease factors and variable follow-up time.
Sixty-six percent of patients were women and their mean age was 34 +/- 12 years. Eighty-eight percent of lenses were worn for daily wear, 12.8 +/- 3.2 hours a day, 6.2 +/- 1.5 days a week. Lens type distribution was 16% DD, 45% 2 week (2W) SH, and 39% 1 month (1M) SH. ECP recommendations for RF varied according to the lens type; 1% of 1M (95% CI 0.2-1.7), 4% of DD (95% CI 2.1-7.2), and 18% of 2W (95% CI 15.1-20.7) patients were given instructions that did not conform to the manufacturers' recommended RF (MRRF). When considering only those patients who were given the correct instructions for RF, 38% were not compliant with the MRRF; noncompliance rates varied according to the lens type and were 12% for DD (95% CI 8.6-17.2), 28% for 1M (95% CI 24.9-32.1), and 52% for 2W (95% CI 47.8-55.8). The most frequent reasons for over wearing lenses were "forgetting which day to replace lenses" (51%) and "to save money" (26%). Fifty-three percent believed that a reminder system would aid compliance; the most popular methods being a cell phone reminder or text message (29%) and a nominated day each week or month (26%). Discussions between the ECPs and the patients were more extensive for patients who were compliant with the MRRF.
The contact lenses, contact lens case, and solution cultures revealed heavy growth of A. xylosoxidans. These findings were confirmed by PCR. The organism was found to be resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. The patient was started on polymyxin B or trimethoprim. After 21 days of treatment, the infection completely resolved with a final spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 20/25.
Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 53 (90%) completed the study successfully. Six subjects were discontinued because of lens handling difficulties (four), unacceptable lens fit (one), and an adverse event (one). Adverse events were reported in three subjects, including the discontinuation, and in each case were due to a chalazion. Overall vision quality, overall comfort, and end-of-day comfort were graded significantly better at each of the follow-up visits compared with baseline with spectacles (P&lt; or =0.0001). Both handling and reported symptoms improved during the course of the study. The questionnaire results indicated that most of both parents and subjects preferred CLs to spectacles across a wide variety of aspects including vision, comfort, handling, and appearance. Significantly, more limbal and bulbar hyperemia was noted at follow-up visits than at baseline (P=0.0001); however, no instances of hyperemia greater than grade 2 were noted at any visit. Significantly, more corneal staining was also noted at the 1- and 3-month follow-up visits than at baseline (21% at 3 months).
Tear evaporation rate was significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) in blepharitics (46.3 +/- 22.9 g/m/hr) than that in normals (18.0 +/- 10.7 g/m/hr). The lipid pattern was found to be significantly less stable (P=0.001) in the blepharitic group compared with that in the normal group. By meibography, meibomian gland dropout was scored and found to be significantly greater (P=0.001) in blepharitics in both the upper eyelids (blepharitis 1.0 +/- 0.8; normal 0.1 +/- 0.3) and lower eyelids (blepharitis 2.1 +/- 8.3; normal 1.0 +/- 0.8). The dropout score was the same or greater for the lower lids than for the upper lids, in all cases. A significant difference (P=0.000) in meibomian gland expression was found between blepharitics and normals; meibum was significantly thicker and more opaque in blepharitics in both the upper (blepharitis 2.2 +/- 0.7; normal 1.0 +/- 0.2) and lower (blepharitis 2.6 +/- 0.7; normal 1.3 +/- 0.4) eyelids.
Despite initial clearing of the donor lenticules, both eyes later experienced nonimmunologic graft failure, probably related to continued amantadine corneal toxicity. After discontinuation of the amantadine, one graft demonstrated partial clearing. Histopathology demonstrated endothelial cell loss. Specular microscopy demonstrated pleomorphism and disruption of the orderly hexagonal array.
Both homB and homA genes were heterogeneously distributed worldwide, with a marked difference between East Asian and Western strains. In Western strains (n = 234, 124 PUD and 110 non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), homB, cagA and vacA s1 were all significantly associated with PUD (p = 0.025, p = 0.014, p = 0.039, respectively), and homA was closely correlated with NUD (p = 0.072). In East Asian strains (n = 138, 73 PUD and 65 NUD), homB was found more frequently than homA, and none of these genes was associated with the clinical outcome. Overall, homB was associated with the presence of cagA (p = 0.043) and vacA s1 (p &lt; 0.001), whereas homA was found more frequently in cagA-negative (p = 0.062) and vacA s2 (p &lt; 0.001) strains. Polymorphisms in homB and homA copy number were observed, with a clear geographical specificity, suggesting an involvement of these genes in host adaptation. A correlation between the homB two-copy genotype and PUD was also observed, emphasizing the role of homB in the virulence of the strain.
The most rejected possible side effects were weight gain, memory loss, and depression. Weight loss was better accepted by patients with a higher body mass. In general, there was a higher acceptance of side effects for patients taking more than 10 symptomatic medications a month, especially for loss of energy and somnolence. Older patients lacked an acceptance of tremor.
Sumatriptan treatment during the aura preempted the development of headache in 34/38 (89%) attacks. The same patients were rendered pain-free in 30/38 (79%) of attacks treated within 1 hour of pain onset, and in 4/19 (21%) of attacks treated 4 hours after the onset of pain. The incidence of allodynia at the time of treatment was 2/38 (5%) in attacks treated during aura, 8/38 (21%) in attacks treated early, and 14/19 (74%) in attacks treated late.
The technique was utilized in a patient who suffered with intractable positional headaches because of a spinal CSF leak for 6 years in spite of numerous surgical and nonsurgical therapies. Significant improvement of symptoms was sustained during a 1-year period of follow-up.
A significant reduction in migraine days (P &lt; .001), tension-type headache days (P &lt; .001), frequency of migraine attacks (P = .004), and depression score (P &lt; .001) was seen at the follow-up after 22 (+/-2) weeks. Comparing the intensive multidisciplinary program with primary care, repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant time x group interactions for migraine days (P = .020), tension-type headache days (P = .016), and frequency of migraine attacks (P = .016). In comparison with the 20-hour multidisciplinary program, the 96-hour program showed significantly better effects only in the reduction of migraine days (P = .037) and depression score (P = .003). The responder-rates (&gt; or =50% improvement) in the 96-hour program were significantly higher than in the 20-hour program (migraine days, P = .008; tension-type headache days, P = .044) and primary care (migraine days, P = .007; tension-type headache days, P = .003; tension-type headache intensity, P = .037). The effect sizes were small to medium in the 96-hour program. Particularly with the reduction of migraine symptomatology, the 96-hour program performed better than the 20-hour program, which produced only negligible or small effects.
In 11 evaluations, 2 patients were pain-free within 3 minutes of stimulation. Three had pain reduction; 5 had no response; 1 was not stimulated. Five patients had no pain relief. Stimulation settings: mean amplitude of 1.2V, mean pulse rate of 67 Hz, mean pulse width of 462 micros. Lack of headache relief appeared linked to suboptimal lead placement, poor physiologic sensory response to localization stimulation, and diagnosis of medication overuse headache.
Patients (n = 144 study 1; n = 139 study 2) had discontinued an average of 3.3 triptans before study entry. Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium was superior (P &lt; .001) to placebo for 2- through 24-hour sustained pain-free response (primary end point) (study 1, 26% vs 8%; study 2, 31% vs 8%) and pain-free response 2 hours post dose (key secondary end point) (study 1, 40% vs 17%; study 2, 44% vs 14%). A similar pattern of results was observed for other end points that evaluated acute (2- or 4-hour), intermediate (8-hour), or 2- through 24-hour sustained response for migraine (ie, pain and associated symptoms), photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea (with the exception of nausea 2 and 4 hours post dose). The percentage of patients with at least 1 adverse event (regardless of causality) was 11% with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium compared with 4% with placebo in study 1 and 9% with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium compared with 5% with placebo in study 2. Only 1 adverse event in 1 study was reported in &gt; or =2% of patients after treatment with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium and reported more frequently with sumatriptan/naproxen than placebo: chest discomfort was reported in 2% of subjects in study 1, and no events met this threshold in study 2. No serious adverse events attributed to study medication were reported in either study.
Some 74% of the 3326 participating pharmacies with a self-considered migraine subject among their staff actually returned the survey questionnaire. Using the ICHD-II criteria, migraine was confirmed in 85% of participating subjects, of whom 38% were under medical supervision and had asked for a prescription, and 27% used recommended medications. The treatment used was truly effective for only 31% of migraineurs. Medication overuse was observed in 21% of all participating subjects, mostly migraineurs. Most migraineurs with medication overuse (81%) used nonrecommended treatments.
In the subgroup of patients with MOH, psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety and mood disorders) was prevalent compared with CM, EM, and controls (P &lt; .0001). Subclinical OCD was significantly prevalent in MOH patients with respect to other groups (P &lt; .0002). Higher scores in Y-BOCS, as a measure of severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, were found in both MOH and CM compared with controls and EM.
Studies 1056 and 1077 included 748 and 745 patients, respectively. Most patients were female (study 1056: 94.4%; study 1077: 94.5%) and white (study 1056: 90.2%; study 1077: 91.0%). Mean ages were 48.8 years (study 1056) and 50.1 years (study 1077). Test re-test reliability coefficients of the Sleep Quality Scale were 0.91 and 0.90 in the 1056 and 1077 studies, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients between baseline Sleep Quality scores and baseline pain diary scores were 0.64 (p &lt; 0.001) and 0.58 (p &lt; 0.001) in the 1056 and 1077 studies, respectively. Correlations between the Sleep Quality Scale and the MOS Sleep subscales were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01), except for the MOS Snoring subscale. Across both studies, standardized effect sizes were generally moderate (0.46 to 0.52) for the 300 mg group and moderate (0.59) or moderate-to-large (0.70) for the 450 mg group. In study 1056, the effect size for the 600 mg group was moderate-to-large (0.73). In study 1077, the effect size for the 600 mg group was large (0.82).
Rasch analysis showed overall support for the psychometric properties of the two MSIS-29 subscales, however it was necessary to reduce the response format of the MSIS-29-PHYS to a 3-point response scale. Both subscales were unidimensional, had good internal consistency, and were free from item bias for sex and age. Dimensionality testing indicated it was not appropriate to combine the two subscales to form a total MSIS score.
During the workshops, nurses demonstrated awareness of poor relationships between themselves and mothers. To tackle this, they proposed measures including weekly meetings to solve problems, maintain respect and increase cooperation, and representation to administrative forces to request better working conditions such as equipment, salaries and staff numbers. The results of the parent satisfaction questionnaire showed some improvement in responsiveness of nurses to client needs, but overall the mean percentage of parents reporting each of 20 problems was not statistically significantly different after the intervention, compared to before it (38.9% versus 41.2%). Post-workshop focus-group discussions with nursing staff suggested that nurses felt more empathic towards mothers and perceived an improvement in the relationship, but that this was hindered by persisting problems in their working environment, including poor relationships with other staff and a lack of response from hospital administration to their needs.
An original set of 33 factors were identified from the literature. The panel reduced the list to 12 in the first round survey. In the second survey, experts scored each factor according to the four domains; summary scores and consensus discussion resulted in the final selection and measurement of four hospital-level factors to be used in the minimization algorithm: improved patient flow as a hospital's leadership priority; physicians' receptiveness to organizational change; efficiency of bed management; and physician incentives supporting the change goal.
Out of a total of 50 patients diagnosed clinically as cutaneous vasculitis, 41 were classified as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, 2 as Heinoch-Schonlein purpura, 2 as urticarial vasculitis and one each as nodular vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa and pityriasis lichenoid et varioliforme acuta. Approximately 50% of the patients had a significant drug history, 10% were attributed to infection and 10% had positive collagen workup without any overt manifestations, while 2% each had Wegener granulomatosis and cryoglobulinemia. No cause was found in 26% cases. Histopathology showed features of vasculitis in 42 patients. Only 23 patients could undergo direct immunofluorescence (DIF), out of which 17 (73.9%) were positive for vasculitis.
Only three MF patients had HTLV-1 infection, whereas two cases of normal subjects had the infection (P &gt; 0.05). The only three seropositive MF patients were male and from North-Eastern Iran.
One hundred and thirty one patients were involved in this study. They comprised of 61 males and 70 females. Most (96.8%) of them had the keloid lesion for more than one year. Sixteen (12.2%) of the patients felt that keloids negatively affect their works, 64 (48.9%) of the patients felt stigmatized by keloids, 28 (56.0%) of them who had lesions in conspicuous parts while 24 (46.2%) had lesions in non-conspicuous parts. Females (59.1%) felt stigmatized than males. Only 47 (35.8%) of the patients believed that keloid swelling limit their social interaction.
A total of 65 pemphigus patients were enrolled. Male to female ratio was 1 : 1.82. Mean age of patients was 44.65 +/- 11.85 years with a range of 14 to 73 years. Thirty two patients completed phase I, of which 28 (9 in phase II, 7 in phase III and 12 in phase III) were maintaining remission and four patients relapsed. Relapse was observed only in patients who discontinued or took irregular treatment. Six patients were declared cured of disease. Five patients died during phase I. Dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse therapy is not absolutely free from adverse effects. Most of the immediate side effects were expected, tolerable and did not pose any problem in continuing treatment. There was a slight increased incidence of weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cataract and Cushingoid habitus, since most of our patients also received additional daily oral steroids. Also, there was a high incidence of secondary pyogenic infections of skin lesions and oral candidiasis during phase I. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest bacteria isolated from the pus of skin lesions. Most of the alterations in laboratory parameters were transitory or correctable, and did not pose a problem in continuing therapy.
Mean age of infected population was 31.62 +/- 8.67 years while peak incidence of PV was in 28-32 years age group. The most common color change was hypopigmentation. No case of PV hyperpigmentation was seen. We could not also observe any association between skin color and duration of being imprisoned with the frequency of infection.
The model is made freely available online (http://www.gulfdoctor.net/model/lhr.htm). Limited number of simulations performed indicated that an eight-week gap between laser sessions may be more effective than a four-week gap.
Among the 68 HIV-1 infected individuals, 49 (72%) were positive for EBV, 5 (7%) samples were positive for CMV. All the five CMV positive individuals had CD4+ T cell count of less than or equal to 200 cells/microL. The mean EBV load among the individuals with a CD4+ T cells of less than or equal to 200 cells/microL was 3.88 log(10) while among those with greater than 200 CD4+ T cells it was 3.75 log(10) . The mean CMV load was 6.98 log(10). Three samples were positive for both CMV &amp; EBV. None of the samples was positive for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, Adenovirus, JC and BK viruses.
Twenty Seven serum samples (21.6%) of infants, of the 125 tested, were positive for CMV-IgM antibodies. Twenty five samples (20%) showed amplification of CMV-DNA. All 25 samples positive for PCR were positive for CMV IgM antibodies. Sera of 73 mothers, out of 75 tested (97.3%), were positive for CMV IgG antibodies. However, none of them was positive for CMV IgM antibodies. Mothers of all 27 positive babies were positive for CMV-IgG antibodies. Serum and urine samples from 20 normal babies were negative for ELISA and PCR.
Rifampicin resistance was detected successfully by PCR-SSCP in 20/22(90.90%) of rifampicin-resistant strains showing a total of nine different mutations in seven codon positions: codon 513 (CAA--&gt;CCA), 516 (GAC--&gt;GTC), 507 (GGC--&gt;GAC), 526 (CAC--&gt;GAC, TAC), 531 (TCG--&gt;TTG, TGG), 522 (TCG--&gt;TGG) and 533 (GTG--&gt;CCG). Two rifampicin-resistant strains showed an identical PCR-SSCP pattern with the wild type H37Rv; 77.27% rifampicin-resistant strains showed a single point mutation and 9.09% had no mutation. Three rifampicin-resistant strains showed characteristic double mutations at codon positions 526 and 531. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 90.90% and 100%.
Among the 20 strains, 19 showed resistance to both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), one strain to NNRTIs and five strains showed protease inhibitors (PI) resistance and 3-class resistance. The most common mutation conferring NRTI resistance was M184V (90%) while K103N (45%) was the most common mutation conferring NNRTI resistance. The M46I mutation was seen in 20% of the Pr sequences.
Bacteria were isolated by culture in 37.9% of MEF specimens, 14.7% of which belonged to the group H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. PCR was positive in 30.5% specimens targeting the same pathogens. There was a two-fold increase in carriage rate of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in patients than controls for each pathogen.
In 2005, 321 AEs were reported, and in 2006 there were 673. Of them, those in the elderly constituted 60 (18.9%) and 44 (11.8%) AEs in the 2 years, respectively. About 7 (11.6%) of the AEs in elderly in 2005 were due to medications not fulfilling Beers criteria but none in 2006. Two thirds of the AEs in both years were found to be due to antidiabetics, oral anticoagulants and antiplatelets and drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Warfarin, digoxin and insulin accounted for a quarter of the AEs.
There were no significant differences in the weight, gender, modes of delivery and age of neonates between the two groups. Similarly the mean total serum bilirubin (TSB) level at the time of admission was not significantly different between the two groups [mean+/- SD: 19.72 +/- 1.79 (95% confidence interval: 19.12-20.54 mg/dL) vs. 20.05 +/- 2.82 (95% confidence interval, 19.54-22.04 mg/dL), P= 0.57]. The mean TSB 48 hours after phototherapy [mean+/- SD: 8.06+/- 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 7.94-10.18 mg/dL) vs.10.94 +/- 2.87 (95% confidence interval: 9.92-12.16 mg/dL), P= 0.02] and the mean duration of phototherapy [mean+/- SD: 64.32 +/- 12.48 (95% confidence interval: 60-81.6 hours) vs. 87.84 +/- 29.76 (95% confidence interval: 79.2-108 hours), P&lt; 0.001] were significantly lower in the clofibrate-treated group.
A total of 716 patients were registered at the TU. The survival rates by the end of the intensive phase were 96%, 93% and 99% in categories I, II and III of DOTS, respectively. The cumulative survival rates were 93%, 88% and 96% in the three DOTS categories, respectively. There was a significant difference in the survival curves amongst the three DOTS categories (log rank statistic= 7.26, d.f..= 2, P=0 0.02) and amongst the different age groups [log rank statistic= 8.78, d.f.= 3, P= 0.012). There was no difference in the survival curves of male and female patients (log rank statistic= 0.05, d.f.= 1, P= 0.80) and according to type of disease (log rank statistic= 5.63, d.f.= 2, P= 0.05). On Cox proportional hazard analysis, age groups of 40 to 60 years [adjusted hazard ratio= 7.81 (1.002-60.87)] and above 60 years [adjusted hazard ratio= 21.54 (2.57-180.32)] were identified as significant risk factors for death.
The genotype distribution, allele and haplotype frequencies of VDR polymorphism did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Mean age and waist-hip ratio of patients were found to be associated with VDR polymorphism. Combination studies showed FFBbtt increased the risk of T2DM in north Indians.
More than 1000 titles were reviewed by the authors, and the most important concepts were selected from 143 full-text articles.
Among the 319 women enrolled, the overall prevalence of trichomonal infection was 9.1% (95% CI, 5.9%-12.3%). The mean age was 26.3 years, and 35.5% reported having had unprotected intercourse with nonprimary partners and 19.8% reported two or more sex partners in the last three months. Trichomonal infection was associated with increased number of sex partners (PR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6) and unprotected sex with nonprimary partner in the last three months (PR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9).
S. platensis at 400 mg kg(-1) per oral significantly elevates serum albumin and decreases the serum cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase activities, lipid peroxidation, paw thickness as well as normalize the joint histopathology of CIA rats.
Ten of the 52 identified studies met the preset criteria and were included in the analysis. The exercise-alone interventions were about 5 times more effective compared to multifactorial ones. Short-term interventions, smaller samples, and younger age related to better outcomes.
The prevalence of CVD increases with age, obesity, and risky medical checkups. Female risky sleepers are more likely to receive a CVD diagnosis than men who report risky sleep patterns (p &lt; .05).
Ninety percent of the Black-White difference in disability rates for men and 75% of the difference for women aged 55 to 64 were explained by income and education.
Of 142 inpatients (mean age 73 years), 84 were eligible to vote, and 22 actually voted (turnout 25.2%). Among the voters, 23% had an MMSE score of less than 12; 58% of abstentions were procedure-related.
Cystocele size was sensitive to abdominal pressure and impairment of connective tissue and muscle. Larger cystocele formed in the presence of impairments in muscular and apical connective tissue support compared to either support element alone. Apical impairment resulted in a larger cystocele than paravaginal impairment. Levator ani muscle impairment caused a larger urogenital hiatus size, longer length of the distal vagina exposed to a pressure differential, larger apical descent, and resulted in a larger cystocele size.
There was a significantly improved preservation of platelet count following CPB in the PC group (p = 0.028), which was sustained over a period of 72 hours. The use of PC-coated circuits further resulted in a significant attenuation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01); however, we were unable to detect any differences in clinical outcomes.
There were no deaths. Fifteen patients (83.3%) responded to conservative therapy. Lymph leak ranged from 2.5 to 14.7 mL/kg per day for 8 to 42 days. Three patients with persistent drainage required thoracotomy with pleurodesis to achieve resolution, in two of which previously attempted chemical pleurodesis with doxycycline proved ineffective. Duration of lymph leak in this subgroup ranged from 15 to 47 days with 5.1 to 7.4 mL/kg per day output.
Serum cytokine and NSE levels were significantly increased after CPB above their normal range in both groups. In the study group, IL-6 and NSE levels were significantly reduced while IL-10 levels were much higher after CPB. High NSE levels significantly correlated with IL-6 levels in the control group.
There were no differences in consumption of packed cell units, blood loss, re-exploration for bleeding, and early clinical outcome between the groups. Patients in the TEG group had significantly lower median units of fresh frozen plasma and platelets compared with the other group (p = 0.001). The median number of total allogeneic units transfused (packed cells and blood products) was significantly reduced in the TEG group compared with the other group (median 2, range 1-3 units vs. median 3, range 2-4 units, respectively, p = 0.001). The need for tranexamic acid was significantly diminished in the TEG group compared with the other group (10.3% vs. 19%, respectively, p = 0.007).
Early extubation rates were significantly increased with QIP (QIP 53% vs. Non-QIP 38%, p = 0.01). Early extubation was associated with a lower rate of (1) pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]= 0.35, 95% confidence intervals [CI]= 0.22-0.55, p &lt;0.001), (2) sepsis (OR = 0.38, CI = 0.20-0.74, p &lt;0.004), (3) prolonged ICU length of stay (OR = 0.42, CI = 0.35-0.50, p &lt;0.001), (4) hospital length of stay (OR = 0.37, CI = 0.29-0.47, p &lt;0.001), (5) ICU readmission (OR = 0.55, CI = 0.39-0.78, p &lt;0.001), and (6) reintubation (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.34-0.81, p &lt;0.003) both in multivariable logistic regression analysis and propensity score adjustment.
Comparison of all tested pacing locations revealed that RVOT stimulation provided the highest bypass grafts flows (59.9 +/- 6.1 mL/min) and PI (2.2 +/- 0.1) when compared with RVPS (51.3 +/- 4.7 mL/min, PI = 2.6 +/- 0.2), RVIW (54.0 +/- 5.1 mL/m; PI = 2.4 +/- 0.2), and LVPS (53.1 +/- 4.5 mL/min; PI = 2.3 +/- 0.1), respectively (p &lt; 0.05). When analyzing patients according to their preoperative LV function (group I = EF &gt; 50%; group II = EF &lt; 50%), higher bypass graft flows were observed with RVOT pacing in patients with lower EF (p = n.s.).
Two patients were younger than one year (Group A), and six patients were older than one year (group B). The mean intensive care unit stay was 2.5 +/- 0.7 days for Group A and 2.8 +/- 1.9 for Group B. The mean hospital stay was 4 +/- 1.4 days for Group A and 4.3 +/- 2.4 days for Group B. There was no mortality and no complications. The mean follow-up period is 14 +/- 15.7 months with a range of one to 39 months. At the time of the last follow-up, all patients were asymptomatic in New York Heart Association class I and follow-up echocardiography on six of eight patients showed wide open coronary ostium.
Most cases of retained catheters are associated with difficulty inserting or advancing the catheter. Among those cases treated conservatively, approximately one third of patients developed symptoms. Factors that must be considered when weighing the decision to surgically remove the retained catheter include patient comorbidities and desires, size and location of the fragment, infectious risk, the presence of neurologic symptoms, and scheduled surgical procedure.
FEV1 (%) and FEV1/FVC levels at the postoperative fifth day were significantly lower in group II (I = 71.5 +/- 4.9 vs. II = 63.5 +/- 8.3 and I = 24.1 vs. II = 22.1), respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of postoperative pleural effusions and atelectasis at the postoperative fifth day were significantly higher in group II (I = 35%, 15% vs. II = 48%, 35%), respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The pain score was higher in group II at postoperative fifth day.
Both groups were comparable in their baseline demographic and surgical characteristics. During the first 24 hours post-operatively, cumulative blood loss was significantly less in TA group (median of 626 ml) compared to Placebo group (median of 1040 ml) (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the post-op Packed RBCs transfusion between both groups (median of one unit in each) (P = 0.82). Significant less platelets transfusion required in TA group (median zero unit) than in placebo group (median 2 units) (P = 0.03). Apart from re-exploration for excessive surgical bleeding in one patient in TA group, no difference was found in morbidity or mortality between both groups.
Postinfarction patients are enrolled from September 2008 through December 2009. Results will be available in mid-2010.
Sixty and 180 min of breathing hyperoxic gas induced significant protection against severe ischemia and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. Total number of premature ventricular beats was markedly attenuated by hyperoxia pre-exposure, especially in H60 and H180 groups. Duration of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was also affected by hyperoxia. Hyperoxia reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes in ischemia and reperfusion phase. Accordingly, severity of arrhythmias (arrhythmia score) and infarct size were lower in hyperoxia-treated groups. The effects were more pronounced using hyperoxia immediately before harvesting the heart.
Elevated admission cTnT was associated with a higher corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count (P = 0.04) and with a trend toward worse myocardial blush grade at the end of the procedure (P = 0.069), indicating a higher degree of microvascular obstruction. This was confirmed by its correlation with the size of perfusion defect seen at first-pass cardiovascular magnetic resonance (rho = 0.42, P = 0.028). In contrast, admission cTnT did not correlate with the amount of muscle necrosis as seen by delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (rho = 0.12, P = 0.55).
Analysis of the choices of the 5102 students who passed the NRE showed that medical (p&lt;0.001) and anesthesia-resuscitation (p=0.04) specialties were more highly sought than surgical specialties. Surgery was chosen by 14 to 19% of the students among the first 100, 500, and 2500 students. The mean NRE ranking for future gastrointestinal surgeons was 1390, placing this specialty sixth. In all, 929 students (638 women, 69%) completed the questionnaire: 353 (38%) wanted to specialize in a medical field and 191 (21%) in a surgical field. This distribution was influenced by sex: 41.3% of the men and 22.9% of women planned to become surgeons (p&lt;0.0001). Of the students planning to enter surgical fields, 54 wanted to become gastrointestinal surgeons (5.8% overall). The principal reasons for not choosing surgery were lack of interest (n=331, 73%) and too much work (n=109, 24%).
Morbidity was 37% in the hand-sewn group and 38% in the stapled group (ns). Mean duration of surgery in the hand-sewn group was 288 minutes and in the stapled group, 246 minutes (p&lt;0.001). At 1 year, the rate of perfect continence was 71% for the hand-sewn group and 76% for the stapled group (ns). Significantly, more patient from the hand-sewn groups used enemas (16% versus 3%, p&lt;0.005). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the two groups for wearing protection, urgency, number of stools a day or gas/stool discrimination.
Mean age of patients was 50 +/- 13 yr, and 70% were women. Thirty-one patients had microprolactinomas, 11 had macroprolactinomas, and four had nontumoral hyperprolactinemia. The overall recurrence was 54%, and the estimated risk of recurrence by 18 months was 63%. The median time to recurrence was 3 months (range, 1-18 months), with 91% of recurrences occurring within 1 yr after discontinuation. Size of tumor remnant prior to withdrawal predicted recurrence [18% increase in risk for each millimeter (95% confidence interval, 3-35; P = 0.017)]. None of the tumors enlarged in the patients experiencing recurrence, and 28% had symptoms of hypogonadism.
We found that the expression of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 was up-regulated in thyroid glands from AITD patients. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the synthesis and release of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 by thyroid follicular cells (TFC) from AITD patients. In addition, these patients showed increased levels of Tie-2(+) monocytes in the peripheral blood, which exhibited an enhanced chemotactic response to Ang-2 or autologous TFC.
The amount of phosphorylated forms of the kinases provided evidence for an activated stress-sensing pathway consisting of the MAP3K Ask1 (but not MLK3 or Tak1), and the MAP2Ks MKK4, 3/6, (but not MKK7), specifically in OM. OM Ask1-mRNA was more highly expressed in predominantly intraabdominally obese persons and most strongly correlated with estimated visceral fat. Diabetes was associated with higher OM Ask1-mRNA only in the lean group. In OM, macrophage infiltration strongly correlated with Ask1-mRNA, but the obesity-associated increase in Ask1-mRNA could largely be attributed to the adipocyte cell fraction. Finally, multivariate regression analyses revealed OM-Ask1 as an independent predictor of whole-body glucose uptake in euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps.
Calcium and PTH levels were normalized after surgery, and biochemical markers of bone turnover decreased by 35%, followed by a significant increase in BMD in the spine (2.7%; P &lt; 0.01) and femoral neck (1.1%; P &lt; 0.02) compared with the observation group. No significant differences were observed between the groups for blood pressure, markers of insulin resistance, detailed cholesterol metabolism, adipokines, or parameters of inflammation and CV surrogate markers.
Decidualized ectopic and eutopic endometrial stromal cells in the three-dimensional collagen gel culture mimicked the morphology of decidual tissue in vivo. In vitro decidualization inhibited the contractility of these eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells. Down-regulation of integrin alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 expression, suppression of Ras homology A (Rho A), Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK)-I and ROCK-II expression, inhibition of the differentiation into the myofibroblastic phenotype, and induction of differentiation into epithelioid decidual phenotype were observed in these cells during decidualization.
The Kir6.2-28Delta32 mutation produced a significant decrease in ATP inhibition and an increase in whole-cell K(ATP) currents, explaining the diabetes of the patient. Tolbutamide block was only slightly reduced in the simulated heterozygous state, suggesting that the patient should respond to sulfonylurea therapy. The mutation decreased ATP inhibition indirectly, by increasing the intrinsic (unliganded) channel open probability. Neither effect was observed when Kir6.2 was expressed in the absence of SUR1, suggesting that the mutation impairs coupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2. Coimmunoprecipitation studies further revealed that the mutation disrupted a physical interaction between Kir6.2 and residues 1-288 (but not residues 1-196) of SUR1.
Plasma levels of PCSK9 varied over approximately 100-fold range (33-2988 ng/ml; median, 487 ng/ml). Levels were significantly higher in women (517 ng/ml) than in men (450 ng/ml), and in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women (P &lt; 0.0001), irrespective of estrogen status. Plasma levels of PCSK9 correlated with plasma levels of LDL-C (r = 0.24) but explained less than 8% of the variation in LDL-C levels (r(2) = 0.073). Other factors that correlated with PCSK9 levels included plasma levels of triglycerides, insulin, and glucose. Individuals with loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 and reduced plasma levels of LDL-C also had significantly lower plasma levels of PCSK9 after adjusting for age, gender, and LDL-C levels (P &lt; 0.0001).
Serum ZAG levels were higher in men (P &lt; 0.001 vs. women). Serum ZAG correlated positively with age, parameters of adiposity (waist circumference and BMI), fasting insulin, insulin resistance indices, serum triglycerides, adipocyte-fatty acid-binding protein, and C-reactive protein, and diastolic blood pressure (all P &lt; 0.005, age- and sex-adjusted), and inversely with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (P = 0.008, age- and sex-adjusted). It was also elevated progressively with an increasing number of components of the metabolic syndrome (P for trend &lt; 0.001). On multivariate analysis, serum ZAG was independently associated with male sex, the metabolic syndrome (or type 2 diabetes and serum triglycerides), and C-reactive protein (all P &lt;or= 0.002).
The experimental leuprolide/T clamp yielded statistically age-comparable total, bioavailable, and free T and estradiol (E(2)) concentrations. In this controlled milieu, sequential l-arginine/GHRH infusion stimulated 1.4-fold more (P = 0.021) and l-arginine/GHRP-2 1.3-fold more (P = 0.045) GH release in young than older men. Abdominal visceral fat (AVF) correlated negatively with both GHRH (P = 0.0006; R(2) = 0.39) and GHRP-2 (R(2) = 0.29) efficacy, whereas IGF-I positively predicted the same endpoints (R(2) = 0.25 to 0.30). In multivariate analysis, AVF emerged as a dominant negative determinant of GHRH efficacy (P = 0.002; R(2) = 0.41) and IGF-I as a primary positive determinant of GHRP-2 efficacy (P = 0.007; R(2) = 0.31).
Overall, Tanner 3-5 HA subjects were less sensitive to P-mediated slowing than Tanner 3-5 NC (slope, 4.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 10.3 +/- 7.7; P = 0.006). However, there was variability in the responses of HA subjects; 15 had P sensitivities within the range seen in NC, whereas nine were relatively P insensitive. The two groups had similar testosterone levels. Fasting insulin levels were higher in P-insensitive HA girls (39.6 +/- 30.6 vs. 22.2 +/- 13.9 microIU/ml; P = 0.02), and there was an inverse relationship between fasting insulin and P sensitivity in HA girls (P = 0.02). Tanner 1-2 NC had lower testosterone levels and were more P sensitive than Tanner 3-5 NC (slope, 19.3 +/- 5.8; P = 0.04).
A first stroke or TIA occurred in 119 men (3.5%). Total and free testosterone concentrations in the lowest quartiles (&lt;11.7 nmol/liter and &lt;222 pmol/liter) were associated with reduced event-free survival (P = 0.014 and P = 0.01, respectively). After adjustment including age, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and medical comorbidity, lower total testosterone predicted increased incidence of stroke or TIA (hazard ratio = 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-2.99). Lower free testosterone was also associated (hazard ratio = 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.48), whereas SHBG and LH were not independently associated with incident stroke or TIA.
Compared to placebo, arzoxifene significantly increased lumbar spine (+2.9%) and total hip (+2.2%) BMD. Arzoxifene decreased biochemical markers of bone metabolism compared to placebo. Changes in breast density were neutral or slightly decreased in the arzoxifene vs. placebo group. There was no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma in the arzoxifene group as assessed by central review of baseline and follow-up endometrial biopsies. There was no significant change between the groups in endometrial thickness assessed by transvaginal ultrasound. The incidence of uterine polyps and vaginal bleeding was not significantly different between the groups. Vulvovaginal mycotic infection was the only adverse event significantly increased in the arzoxifene vs. placebo group. Hot flushes were not significantly different between the groups.
Although we did not detect evidence for association between the previously described TCF7L2 T2D locus, the proinsulin:insulin molar ratio, a marker of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, was strongly associated with this locus (P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). We also observed evidence for association between PCOS and two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs11196236 (P = 9.0 x 10(-4)) and rs11196229 (P = 0.0027) mapping more than 100 kb centromeric to the previously published T2D susceptibility loci.
Pretreatment with rhLH significantly decreased the mean threshold (daily effective) FSH dose and tended to lower the total amount of FSH required to induce follicular maturation in association with appropriate serum estradiol levels and endometrial thickness. Unexpectedly, in HH women retaining functional pituitary tissue, pretreatment with rhLH evoked a consistent elevation of serum LH levels during FSH administration, an effect that was also induced, even at higher magnitude, by pretreatment with rhCG.
We identified a KLF15 binding site in the HSD17B5 promoter by using luciferase promoter constructs, EMSA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Overexpression of KLF15 increased HSD17B5 promoter activity and testosterone formation at least 3-fold in cultured H295R cells. Insulin increased KLF15 mRNA expression according to real-time RT-PCR and increased HSD17B5 promoter activity according to luciferase assays. KLF15 overexpression in combination with insulin, glucocorticoid, and cAMP stimulated adipogenesis in H295R cells. In silico and RT-PCR analyses showed that the KLF15 gene promoter undergoes alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner. Comparison of the HSD17B5 promoter in seven different species revealed that the KLF15 binding site has no human homolog in species other than orangutans.
In the region with moderate iodine deficiency, the number of incident users of antithyroid medication increased 46% in the first 4 yr of iodine fortification. The use increased the most among the youngest age group (younger than 40 yr) and the oldest age group (older than 75 yr). In the mildly iodine-deficient region, the number of incident users increased only 18%, and only in the youngest age groups (below 40 and 40-59 yr). After 4 yr of fortification, the incidence rates started to fall and reached baseline, for most groups, 6 yr after onset of fortification.
In vitro, baseline and maximal ANP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis was markedly reduced in PCOS women. Baseline (P &lt; 0.001) and ANP-(P &lt; 0.01) and isoproterenol-(P &lt; 0.001) mediated lipolysis, however, was remarkably increased after training, independent of changes in body weight and sex hormones. These functional improvements were supported by an increased 1) lipolytic sensitivity for ANP (1.3-fold; P &lt; 0.05); 2) lipolytic responsiveness for isoproterenol (1.7-fold; P &lt; 0.01); and 3) postreceptor-acting agent dibutyryl-cAMP (activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase) (2.1-fold; P &lt; 0.05). In vivo, the lipolytic responsiveness to isoproterenol was also reduced in PCOS and tended to increase after exercise training. The insulin suppression of lipolysis during the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was also reduced in PCOS.
Simvastatin induced a dose-dependent decrease of the number and size of endometrial implants in mice. At the highest dose of simvastatin, the number of endometrial implants decreased by 87%, and the volume by 98%. Simvastatin also induced a concentration-dependent decrease in MMP-3 in the absence and presence of inflammatory challenge (using IL-1alpha).
Mean scores on all subscales of all questionnaires, except for the anger/hostility and anxiety subscales of the Symptom Questionnaire, showed significantly impaired quality of life in the GH-deficient group compared with the GH-sufficient group. Peak GH levels after GHRH-arginine stimulation levels were inversely associated with QoL-AGHDA scale scores (R = -0.53; P = 0.0005) and the Symptom Questionnaire Depression subscale scores (R = -0.35; P = 0.031) and positively associated with most SF-36 subscale scores.
A total of 119 subjects were compliant with gel applications with few study-related adverse events. NES alone reduced gonadotropins significantly but less than T gel alone. Combined T gel 10g plus NES gel 6 or 8 mg suppressed both serum gonadotropins to 0.5 IU/liter or less in significantly more men than either gel alone.
On admission, cholestasis was present in 17% of patients (n = 649), increasing to 20% on d 10 (n = 347), whereas ischemic hepatitis decreased from 3.4% (n = 588) to less than 1% (n = 328). IIT significantly decreased biliary sludge on d 5 (50.4 vs. 66.4%, P = 0.01; n = 250). The difference did not remain significant on d 10 (57.4 vs. 66.2%, P = 0.29; n = 136). IIT also lowered the cumulative risk of cholestasis (P = 0.03).
Plasma phosphate fell from 3.4 +/- 0.6 mg/dl at baseline to 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl at wk 1 (P &lt; 0.0001) associated with a fall in percentage tubular reabsorption of phosphate (90 +/- 4.8 to 68 +/- 13; P &lt; 0.001) and 1,25(OH)(2)D (54 +/- 25 to 9 +/- 8 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.001). These indices remained significantly suppressed at wk 2 and 3. 25(OH)D levels were unchanged. FGF23 increased significantly from 43.5 pg/ml at baseline to 177 pg/ml at wk 1 (P &lt; 0.001) with levels correlating with both serum phosphate (R = -0.74; P &lt;0.05) and 1,25(OH)(2)D (R = -0.71; P &lt; 0.05).
Patients with pretreatment IGF-I sd scores in the highest tertile had an almost 4-fold increased risk for radiological osteoarthritis of the hip when compared with patients in the lowest tertile. After adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and disease duration, pretreatment IGF-I sd scores predicted radiographic osteoarthritis in all joint sites. Osteoarthritis was not predicted by other factors, including pretreatment GH levels, type of treatment, and duration of follow-up.
The prevalence of MetSyn was 50% in AA and 49% in NHW. In each group, after adjustment for age and sex, plasma copeptin levels significantly correlated with body mass index, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, and (inversely) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P &lt; 0.05 for each variable). In multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for age, sex, smoking, statin use, serum creatinine, education, physical activity, and diuretic use, plasma copeptin levels in the highest quartile were associated with an increased odds ratio of having MetSyn compared with bottom quartile: odds ratio (95% confidence interval) in AA, 2.07 (1.45-2.95); in NHW, 1.74 (1.21-2.5).
Pretreatment CgA level was significantly higher in patients compared with controls. CgA levels dropped significantly to levels similar to those of controls after antithyroid therapy. Although baseline and follow-up fasting glucose, insulin, and intact proinsulin demonstrated similar pattern of CgA changes before and after medical treatment, CgA did not correlate with any of them. However, CgA levels demonstrated a significant positive correlation with free T(3) and free T(4) only.
Mean IGF-I was significantly reduced after pegvisomant treatment (mean, 539 +/- 176 vs. 198 +/- 168 microg/ml; P = 0.001). The insulin sensitivity of endogenous glucose production was significantly increased after pegvisomant [mean glucose Ra *insulin, 118.5 +/- 28 vs. 69.2 +/- 22 micromol/kg x min *(mU/liter); P = 0.04]. No differences in glucose Rd were seen after pegvisomant. All patients showed a reduction in glycerol Ra adjusted for insulin [mean, 18.12 +/- 1.75 vs. 14.4 +/- 4.75 micromol/kg x min *(mU/liter); P = 0.08] and overnight FFA concentrations (mean area under the curve, 278 +/- 84 vs. 203 +/- 71; P &lt; 0.05) after pegvisomant.
We identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP), a cochaperone recently found mutated in pituitary adenoma patients, as a novel interactor of RET. We showed that RET interacts specifically with AIP both in mammalian cell lines and in vivo in the pituitary gland, regardless of the presence of pituitary adenoma-specific mutations. AIP and RET genes were sequenced in 28 pituitary adenoma, but no relevant mutations were found. In addition, we identified the proapoptotic domain of RET as responsible for the interaction with AIP. Finally, we demonstrated that the AIP-RET interaction does not require RET kinase activity or kinase-dependent signal transduction and that it prevents the formation of the AIP-survivin complex.
There were no differences in age, education, marital status, and identified gender between subjects and controls. No significant differences of general health, psychosocial, and psychosexual functionings of the subjects with anorchia and healthy young adults were demonstrated.
There was an association between rs2016520 and height in both patients with type 2 diabetes and controls without diabetes (combined P = 5 x 10(-5)). In a metaanalysis using published data from Caucasian cohorts totaling more than 38,000 participants, compelling evidence was found for this locus and its association with height (P = 10(-8)) with an overall effect size of about 0.5 cm per allele. A similar analysis in a group of 2700 prepubescent children also displayed a similar effect size to that seen in the adults.
IGF-II protein expression was increased in metastatic tumor vs. uninvolved liver and original tumor. In the metastatic tumor, IGF-II mRNA was increased 60-fold, but H19 mRNA was comparable to uninvolved liver; loss of imprinting of IGF2, but not H19, was identified; no major change in methylation of the IGF2/H19 imprinting control regions was observed; and transcripts from four different IGF2 promoters were detected, compared to two in uninvolved liver.
Dexamethasone stimulated in vitro cortisol secretion from PPNAD tissues in six patients. The stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on cortisol release was not reduced by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 or potentiated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IMBX and the cAMP analog 8Br-cAMP. Conversely, the PKA inhibitor H89 and RU486 inhibited the cortisol response to dexamethasone. Dexamethasone had no effect on cortisol production from normal human adrenocortical cells but stimulated corticosteroidogenesis in the presence of RU486. Similarly, dexamethasone failed to influence corticosterone release by adrenocortical cells removed from Tg(tTA/X2AS) mice but stimulated corticosteroidogenesis in the presence of RU 486.
Median (interquartile range) age was 8.4 yr (6.5-10.2). After metyrapone administration, median (interquartile range) central apnea index (number/hour) increased significantly from 2.2 (0.4-4.7) to 5.2 (1.5-7.9) (P = 0.007). The increase tended to be higher in children with CAI [2.8 (2.0-3.9) vs. 1.0 (-0.2 to 2.6); P = 0.09]. During polysomnography before the metyrapone test, sleep-related breathing was worse in children with CAI, who had a significantly higher central apnea index and tended to have a lower minimum oxygen saturation compared to those without CAI (P = 0.03 and P = 0.07).
Data assessing CGM accuracy, short-term outcomes (12 wk), and longer term outcomes (6 months) are reported. Potential strategies for successful and efficient use in an office or clinic setting are also discussed. Practical aspects of CGM use (alarm settings, using glycemic trending information) are also reviewed.
Serum 25-OHD ranged from 28 to 197 nmol/liter (mean 85 +/- 2 nmol/liter) (sem). Total Ca-abs (intake times fractional absorption) were significantly correlated to 25-OHD in the whole population (r = 0.16, P = 0.001). This relationship was closer in the 197 studies in early puberty (Tanner 2 or 3, r = 0.35, P &lt; 0.001) and not significant in pre- or late pubertal subjects. For the whole population, fractional Ca-abs adjusted for calcium intake were slightly but significantly higher at 25-OHD of 28-50 nmol/liter (0.344 +/- 0.019) compared with 25-OHD of 50-80 nmol/liter (0.280 +/- 0.014) or 25-OHD greater than 80 nmol/liter (0.297 +/- 0.015, P &lt; 0.01 for each), suggesting adaptation to moderately low 25-OHD values.
Despite higher bone mineral density, clinical fracture incidence (14.8 vs. 12.6%) and vertebral fracture prevalence (2.3 vs. 2.9%) were not lower in those with diabetes (P &gt; 0.05). In multivariable models, pentosidine was associated with increased clinical fracture incidence in those with diabetes [relative hazard, 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10, 1.83, for 1 sd increase in log pentosidine] but not in those without diabetes (relative hazard, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.79, 1.49; P value for interaction = 0.030). In those with diabetes, pentosidine was associated with increased vertebral fracture prevalence (adjusted odds ratio, 5.93; 95% CI, 2.08, 16.94, for 1 sd increase in log pentosidine) but not in those without diabetes (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.30, 1.83; P value for interaction = 0.005).
Iodide metabolism, H(2)O(2), cAMP, and inositol phosphate generation in FNAH slices stimulated or not with TSH were normal. The mitogenic response of cultured FNAH thyrocytes to TSH was normal but more sensitive to the hormone. Gene expression profiles of FNAH and AAs showed that among 474 genes significantly regulated in FNAH, 93% were similarly regulated in AAs. Besides, 783 genes were regulated only in AAs. Bioinformatic analysis pointed out common down-regulations of genes involved in immune response, cell/cell and cell/matrix adhesions, and apoptosis. Pathways up-regulated only in AAs mainly involve diverse biosyntheses. These results are consonant with the larger growth of AAs than FNAH tissues.
Human placental explants and TTR expressing JEG-3 cells secrete TTR. JEG-3 cells grown in bicameral chambers secrete TTR, predominantly from the apical surface. Human placental explants and JEG-3 cells internalize Alexa Fluor488-labeled TTR and (125)I-TTR. Furthermore, binding to thyroid hormones (T(4), T(3)) increases (125)I-TTR uptake by enhancing tetramer formation. Cross-linking experiments confirm internalization of the TTR-(125)I-T(4) complex.
In men, positive linear associations between IGF-I and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio with forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) as well as with forced vital capacity (FVC) were detected across all ages, whereas in women this positive association was only detectable above 50 yr. Furthermore, the analyses indicated positive linear relations of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio with FEV1 and FVC, respectively. No significant relations between IGF-I or IGFBP-3 and maximal inspiratory pressure was detectable in both sexes.
A rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR approach on samples from a human pituitary tumor and a cell line enabled identification of two novel alternatively spliced sst5 receptor variants. The sequences obtained encode putative proteins that correspond to truncated isoforms of five and four transmembrane domains (TMDs), accordingly named sst5TMD5 and sst5TMD4, respectively. Both novel receptors show a differential expression pattern in normal tissues and are also present in pituitary tumors of diverse etiology including nonfunctioning adenomas, corticotropinomas, somatotropinomas, and a prolactinoma. In contrast to the predominant plasma membrane localization of full-length sst5, both sst5TMD5 and sst5TMD4 show a preferentially intracellular localization. Despite their truncated nature, both receptors are functional, as shown by their ability to mediate selective, ligand-induced rises in free cytosolic calcium concentration. Specifically, whereas sst5TMD5 is selectivity activated by somatostatin compared with cortistatin, cells transfected with sst5TMD4 almost exclusively respond to cortistatin and not to somatostatin.
The accuracy of the automated bone age determination was 0.71-0.72 yr, and the precision was 0.17-0.18 yr. More than 98.6% of the images could be analyzed. The system was validated on children with various diagnoses of short stature in the bone age range 2.5-17 yr for boys and 2-15 yr for girls.
Baseline characteristics and growth responses in NS patients with reported near-adult height (NAH) (n = 65) were compared to patients with idiopathic GH deficiency (n = 3007) and Turner syndrome (TS; n = 1378) with reported NAH to identify factors contributing to NAH optimization in NS.
NS patients (mean enrollment age, 11.6 yr) received rhGH (mean, 0.33 mg/kg . wk) for a mean of 5.6 yr. No significant difference was observed in Delta height sd score (SDS) between NS (+1.4 +/- 0.7) and TS (+1.2 +/- 0.9). However, Delta height SDS for NS and TS differed significantly from idiopathic GH deficiency (+1.7 +/- 1.0) (P &lt; 0.0001). Mean gain in NAH above projected was 10.9 +/- 4.9 cm (males) and 9.2 +/- 4.0 cm (females). Duration of prepubertal rhGH was an important contributor to prepubertal change in height SDS (r(2) = 0.97). Height SDS at pubertal onset highly correlated with NAH SDS (rho = 0.783; P &lt; 0.0001). Duration of puberty highly correlated with pubertal height gain in centimeters for males (rho = 0.941) and females (rho = 0.882) (P &lt; 0.01). No new adverse events were observed.
Men with KS were on average taller and heavier and tended to have a higher body mass index than the men in the control group. Serum free T(4) (fT4) was lower in men with KS than controls [mean (sd): 16.3 (2.35) vs. 17.6 (1.75) pmol/liter; P &lt; 0.001], with clustering in or just below the lower part of the reference range for the assay. The ratio fT4 to free T(3) was low in KS (P &lt; 0.001), whereas no differences between groups were observed in TSH, free T(3), TSH to fT4 ratio, thyroid volume, or the prevalence of thyroid antibodies. No difference in any of the variables were observed between testosterone-treated and untreated KS men. Adjustment for differences in height, weight, and concomitant disease in multivariate models did not alter the results.
Posterior-anterior and lateral spine BMD increased 12.5 +/- 1.5 and 16.9 +/- 1.7%, respectively, during the first 12 months of teriparatide administration and 5.2 +/- 0.8 and 6.2 +/- 1.8%, respectively, during teriparatide retreatment (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001). Increases in osteocalcin (P &lt; 0.001), N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P &lt; 0.001), and N-telopeptide (P &lt; 0.001) were greater during the first period of teriparatide administration.
Hypertension was cured in 15% of patients and improved in 20%, usually within 1 yr of unilateral adrenalectomy. The proportion with controlled hypertension was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher after adrenalectomy (65%) than before (25%). Mean systolic (P &lt; 0.001) and diastolic (P &lt; 0.001) blood pressure, left ventricular mass index (P &lt; 0.05), plasma upright aldosterone (P &lt; 0.05), and aldosterone/renin ratio (P &lt; 0.001) fell. Serum creatinine independently predicted hypertension cure.
All had a history of undescended testes; age at orchiopexy ranged from 2 months to 6 yr. Pubertal signs were variable, but none achieved full genital development. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in PWS boys were near the lower limits of normal, decreasing from 44.4 +/- 17.8 ng/ml (mean +/- sd) in young children to 5.9 +/- 4.7 ng/ml in adolescents, similar to normal males. In contrast, inhibin B was consistently low (27.1 +/- 36.1 pg/ml) or undetectable in all age groups. In adult males, FSH levels were high (20.3 +/- 18.3 IU/liter), LH levels were normal (4.2 +/- 4.3 IU/liter), and testosterone levels were low (1.87 +/- 1.17 ng/ml). Only two adults had severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with undetectable levels of LH and FSH and high AMH levels (34.9 and 36.7 ng/ml), unlike the other nine adults with AMH levels 2.6 +/- 2.1 ng/ml. Androstenedione (1.06 +/- 0.30 ng/ml) and DHEAS (281.1 +/- 143.6 microg/dl) in adult PWS were normal.
After correction for multiple testing, none of the variants showed significant evidence for association with PCOS, the metabolic syndrome, or any of the quantitative traits tested.
SI was found to be negatively correlated with age, whereas IGI(30) increased until young adulthood. The increase IGI(30) was apparently insufficient to compensate for the insulin resistance because DI decreased linearly at the rate of 0.035 (10(-2) min(-1) mmol(-1) liter per year) after young adulthood. Both IGI(30) and DI were significantly lower in those with vs. without autoantibodies, whereas there was no difference between these groups with respect to SI.
During a mean follow-up period of 4.5 yr, 383 deaths occurred. In multivariate hazards regression models, low levels (within quartile 1 vs. quartiles 2-4) of both testosterone [hazard ratio (HR), 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-2.12] and estradiol (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.22-1.95) associated with mortality. A model including both hormones showed that both low testosterone (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.11-1.92) and estradiol (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.73) predicted mortality. Risk of death nearly doubled (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.62) in subjects with low levels of both testosterone and estradiol compared with subjects within quartiles 2-4 of both hormones.
Total and regional fat mass were found to be inversely associated with areal bone mass and bone size, independent from lean mass (radius periosteal circumference beta: -0.29 +/- 0.04; P &lt; 0.001). Lean mass was positively associated with bone size but inversely with cortical density at both tibia and radius (P &lt; 0.01). The negative association between total fat mass and bone size was independent from sex steroid concentrations. Leptin but not adiponectin was inversely associated with bone size, but this was no longer significant after adjustment for body fat.
Appetite was influenced by the size and energy content of the meals, but not by variation in energy availability which also did not trigger consummatory compensation. Exercise reduced hunger and increased fullness. Ghrelin, leptin, and insulin responded to changes in energy availability but not to meal size. Appetite was unaffected by physiological changes in ghrelin, leptin, or insulin.
Spontaneous osteoclastogenesis, without adding macrophage-colony stimulating factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), and significantly higher osteoclasts resorption activity occurred in 21-OHD patients. Conversely, macrophage-colony stimulating factor and RANKL were essential to trigger and sustain osteoclastogenesis in controls. Furthermore, in 21-OHD patients, we identified a significant percentage of CD11b-CD51/CD61 and CD51/61-RANK-positive cells, which are OCPs strongly committed. Additionally, we demonstrated a T cell-dependent osteoclastogenesis from 21-OHD patients' PBMCs. T cells from patients expressed high levels of RANKL and low levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) with respect to controls. Moreover, 21-OHD patients had higher soluble RANKL and lower OPG serum levels compared with controls; thus, soluble RANKL to OPG ratio was significantly higher in patients than controls.
The net protein balance was not affected by rhIGF-I alone, whereas serum insulin and IGFBP-3 decreased (P &lt; 0.05) and IGFBP-1 increased (P &lt; 0.01). With the combination rhGH + rhIGF-I, an increase of IGFBP-3 (P &lt; 0.01) and insulin (P &lt; 0.01) as well as a decrease of IGFBP-1 (P &lt; 0.01) occurred. Plasma essential AAs (P = 0.01) as well as the essential to nonessential AA ratio (P &lt; 0.001) decreased. Whole-body protein net balance increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with a 22% decrease in leucine oxidation and a 15% increase in nonoxidative leucine disposal.
VFs were detected in 37 of 150 (24.6%) patients and 12 of 300 (4.0%) controls (P &lt; 0.0001). The majority of VFs were mild. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that in PHPT patients lumbar spine bone mineral density was the only variable independently associated with the prevalence of VFs (P = 0.003). The rate of fracture was higher in symptomatic (34.1%) than asymptomatic (21.1%) patients, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). Among asymptomatic patients, fracture rate was significantly higher in those who met the criteria for parathyroidectomy (28.1%) than in those who did not (11.1%) (P = 0.03). Compared to controls, the fracture rate was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic PHPT who met the criteria for surgery (P &lt; 0.0001), but not in those who did not meet the criteria (P = 0.06).
Patients on average had 2-3% lower BMD at L1-L4, femoral neck, and total hip (P &lt; 0.01 at all sites). The modifiable risk factors for BMD below the expected range for age (Z-score &lt;-2) were: more than 1-yr delay in diagnosis of estrogen deficiency (P = 0.018), low (&lt;32 ng/ml) vitamin D levels (P = 0.002), estrogen replacement nonadherence (P = 0.002), low calcium intake (P = 0.005), and lack of exercise (P = 0.005). As compared to Caucasians, African-American and Asian women with POI were 3.18 and 4.34 times more likely, respectively, to have Z-scores below -2 (P = &lt; 0.0001 for both). Race was an overall risk factor, but on regression modeling, not an independent predictor of low bone density.
GL and GL5 cells expressed several P4 binding proteins including the nuclear progesterone receptor (PGR), progestin/adipoQ receptors (PAQR 7, 8, and 5) and PGRMC1. Ligand binding studies revealed that both P4 and the progestin, R5020, bound PGRMC1 with an EC(50) of approximately 10 nm. Interestingly, P4 inhibited apoptosis at concentrations in the 10 nm range, whereas R5020 stimulated P4 secretion at concentrations of at lease 16 mum. Depleting PGRMC1 attenuated P4's antiapoptotic action but failed to influence R5020-induced P4 secretion.
The protein expressions of BOLL and CDC25A are significantly decreased in patients with spermatogenic failure, with the lowest levels detected in patients with meiotic arrest. Both protein expressions are significantly correlated with spermatocyte numbers. Expressional profiling analysis among BOLL protein, CDC25A mRNA, and CDC25A protein suggests a causal relationship between BOLL and CDC25A. BOLL specifically binds to a 21-nucleotide region of the CDC25A 3'UTR, and this region is evolutionarily conserved. A U-rich region within this 21-nucleotide sequence is crucial for binding. BOLL stimulates CDC25A translation, and this effect does not involve alteration of mRNA stability.
BW was nongenetically, positively associated with height, weight, and total and regional (trunk, arm, and leg) fat mass and percentages in the young twins. In the elderly twins, BW was persistently nongenetically related to height as well as leg fat mass and percentage. Insulin sensitivity was nongenetically influenced by total fat percentage as well as arm and trunk fat percentages, all leading to a decrease in insulin sensitivity by 20% per sd increase in the elderly twins. Conversely, a sd increase in BW led to an increase of 16% in insulin sensitivity. Total body fat and regional fat was similarly associated with insulin sensitivity in the younger twins, whereas no influence of BW was seen.
In one family, an affected member was homozygous for a M(3) change in codon 65 that replaces valine with isoleucine (V65I). The V65I receptor was expressed in CHO cells where it had normal ability to transmit methacholine signaling.
Investigations confirmed HH (blood glucose level of 1.8 mmol/liter with simultaneous serum insulin level of 58 mU/liter) with normal acylcarnitines and urine organic acids. Sequencing of the HADH gene identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.562A&gt;G; p.Met188Val). Hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity was significantly decreased compared with controls (index patient, mean +/- sem, 26.8 +/- 4.8 mU/mg protein; controls, 48.0 +/- 8.1 mU/mg protein; P = 0.029) in skin fibroblasts. This patient was severely protein sensitive. Two other children with HH due to HADH gene mutations also demonstrated marked protein sensitivity.
The prevalence of overweight/obesity, positive family history of thyroid diseases, and thyroid hypoechogenicity was 28.4, 45.5, and 22.7%, respectively. Median TSH was higher in overweight/obese patients than in normal-weight ones (7.4 vs. 5.7 muIU/ml; P = 0.04) and in overweight/obese patients with hypoechogenicity than in those with normal ultrasound pattern (8.5 vs. 6.8 muIU/ml; P = 0.04). Adjusted daily UIE was lower in subjects without than in those with a positive family history of thyroid diseases (81 vs. 120 mug/d; P = 0.001). The prevalence of a positive family history of thyroid diseases was 1.9-fold higher in patients with nonsynonymous mutations in the TSH-R gene than in patients without any mutation (80 vs. 42%; P = 0.03). A novel mutation at position 1559 in exon 10 (W520X) was detected in one child.
The risk of overweight was doubled in offspring of women with diet-treated GDM or type 1 diabetes compared with offspring from the background population, whereas the risk of the metabolic syndrome was 4- and 2.5-fold increased, respectively. Offspring risk of the metabolic syndrome increased significantly with increasing maternal fasting blood glucose as well as 2-h blood glucose (during oral glucose tolerance test).
Overall, five patients had a heterozygous HNF1B deletion, presenting renal disease, elevated liver enzymes, and diabetes. Diabetes was characterized by insulin resistance and adolescent onset of hyperglycemia. Additionally, clinical features in some patients were pancreas dysplasia and exocrine insufficiency (two of five patients), genital defects (three of five), mental retardation (two of five), and eye abnormalities (coloboma, cataract in two of five). One case also had severe growth deficit combined with congenital cholestasis, and another case had common variable immune deficiency. All patients reported here had monoallelic loss of the entire HNF1B gene. Whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed a precurrent genomic deletion of approximately 1.3-1.7 Mb in size.
'Getting back a good night's sleep' was the core theme for describing and guiding the process of the women's sleep disturbance experiences. During the process, 'disturbed sleep' was identified as the antecedent condition that included subcategories: easy awakening, difficulty falling asleep, inner worries, physical discomfort and genetic and bodily constitution. Analyses showed five categories (some with subcategories) of the sleep disturbed women: (i) worsening health status - physical exhaustion, impaired social interactions, emotional swings and decreased work performance; (ii) living with lonely nights - self-help and endurance; (iii) a search for resources to relieve sleep difficulties - doctor shopping, trying alternative therapies, exercising and seeking support; (iv) vicious cycle and (v) acceptance of insomnia.
The experimental group was significantly more likely than the control group to demonstrate higher levels of self-efficacy for childbirth (p &lt; 0.0001), lower perceived anxiety (p &lt; 0.001, early stage and p = 0.02, middle stage) and pain (p &lt; 0.01, early stage and p = 0.01, middle stage) and greater performance of coping behaviour during labour (p &lt; 0.01).
There were significant differences in functions of affected upper extremities, activity of daily living and depression between experimental and control group.
In the music group, levels of oxytocin increased significantly in contrast to the control group for which the trend over time was negative i.e., decreasing values. Subjective relaxation levels increased significantly more and there were also a significant higher levels of PaO2 in the music group compared to the control group. There was no difference in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and SaO2 between the groups.
Sixty per cent of the participants used some form of folk remedies in the care of their hospitalised children. The most frequently used remedies were: spirit-calling (63%); carrying a cross or incense bag (47%), praying a Buddhist mantra (36%). There was a positive relationship between a positive attitude towards folk remedies and current use with children (p &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that parents' previous experience of using folk remedies (odds ratio = 0.272, p = 0.037), and parents' knowledge of the care of disease (odds ratio = 18.044, p = 0.015) were the strongest predictors of use of folk remedies. Almost three-fourths (73%) of all participants expected that health care providers would respect and not interfere with their use of folk remedies; 72% of parents stated that they would not tell healthcare providers about the use of folk remedies.
Student t-test showed that there was no significant difference between two groups in mean scores of health-related quality of life before the study but this test showed a significant difference between two groups, one and two months after intervention (p &lt; 0.05). anova test with repeated measurements showed that there is a significant difference in mean score of whole and dimensions of health-related quality of life between two groups in three times (p &lt; 0.05).
Pain levels of the children according to both scales in intervention group were lower than those of control group. But, it was detected that the distinction between score averages of intervention and control group of Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, not Visual Analogue Scale, was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001).
The degree of anxiety improvement was significantly higher in the progressive muscle relaxation training group than in the control group after progressive muscle relaxation training intervention (p &lt; 0.0001) and at follow-up (p = 0.0446; the mean BAI score fell from 16.4 pretest to -5.8 post-test. After adjusting for the change in patient finger temperature, the mean change in temperature was significantly different between the two patient groups. The average body temperature increased significantly after applying the progressive muscle relaxation training to patients with schizophrenia.
Disability was found in 11% of Taiwanese individuals diagnosed with either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Those in disability reported more severe disease activity, pain, depression and lower life satisfaction. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that 31-46% of the total variance of disability could be explained by age, gender, marriage, joint pain score, diagnosis, disease activity, depression and pain management. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had significantly higher levels of disability, disease activity during the preceding six months, more depression and less life satisfaction than patients with osteoarthritis.
Forty-two per cent of patients arrived at the emergency department with a family member: spouse or cohabiting partner, mother, father or daughter. Patients were fairly satisfied with the counselling. The presence of a family member was important to the majority of patients (75%). About half of the patients wanted information concerning their illness, condition and treatment to be given to their family members. Those visiting the department with a family member were more satisfied with counselling and felt that it promoted their participation in care.
Soft tissue massage gave the relatives' feelings of 'being cared for', 'body vitality' and 'peace of mind'. For a while, they put worries of daily life aside as they just experienced 'being'. During massage, it became apparent that body and mind is constituted of an indestructible completeness. The overarching theme was 'inner power, physical strength and existential well-being in their daily lives'.
Predictors of adherence to prescribed medications in the hierarchical logistic regressions were treatment control, risk factors and psychological attribution. In the self-management model, we found that symptoms experienced after a hypertension diagnosis, symptoms for blood pressure prediction, personal control, balance and cultural causal attribution were significant predictors of adherence to self-management, adding an additional 21% of the variance. The results of analysis of variance showed that those who were unsure if they had experienced symptoms after a hypertension diagnosis were more likely to self-regulate (increase or decrease) prescribed medications than those without symptoms.
Approximately one-third of the patients (28.1%) used a herbal product after the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Of these, 13.2% reported currently taking herbal products. A minority of participants (12.5%) informed their physician of herbal product use. Marital status was the only variable significantly associated with herbal product use.
The majority of people fell indoors (n = 23), were repeat fallers (n = 22) with more than half alone when they fell (n = 15). For five people it was their first ever fall. Participants in primary care trust 1 had a higher mean age than those in primary care trust 2 and had more injurious falls (n = 12, mean age 87 years vs. n = 15, mean age 81 years). The majority of non-injurious falls went unreported to formal services. Falls can result in a decline in health status, ability to undertake activities of living, lifestyle and quality of life.
The meaning of feeling well for people with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury was that the initially unfamiliar life with traumatic brain injury became familiar. This included finding strength, regaining control over everyday life, being close to someone and being good enough. People with traumatic brain injury felt well when they became reconciled with the circumstances of their life and created a new entity in that life, in which their complete health had been lost.
The findings from this study revealed that chronic hepatitis C and combination therapy had an enormous impact on the lives of the patients, their partners and families. The illness and treatment had significant physiological effects that had an impact on quality of life; however, the social and psychological consequences of living with a highly stigmatised disease with an unknown course and outcome cannot be underestimated.
Patients fell into one of two groups: 'high' or 'low' perceived controllers. High-perceived controllers were more likely to view their active involvement in self care positively, as being necessary in managing treatment-related effects and were less likely to rely on nurses to take overall responsibility for the management of treatment-related side effects. Low-perceived controllers were less likely to believe in the importance or necessity of their active involvement in self care and more likely to perceive nurses as being the ones responsible for the management of treatment-related side effects.
Twenty-three per cent felt anxious on arrival at the operating theatre, 35% were anxious at induction of anaesthesia, while 12% felt anxious after induction. At start of surgery 15% experienced anxiety and during surgery 9% were anxious. Continuous information reduced the experience of anxiety in 49% of the patients and the opportunity to ask questions during the intraoperative period reduced anxiety in 55%. The sight of technical equipment and surgical instruments was reported to increase anxiety in 9% and 6% of the sample, respectively. Patients with higher levels of general anxiety and depression also experienced significantly higher levels of anxiety in the intraoperative period.
Individuals with a low health literacy had significantly higher rates of arthritis and hypertension. After adjusting for age, education and income, older individuals with low health literacy had higher limitations in activity and lower subjective health. In a model adjusting for age and income only, older individuals with low health literacy were more likely to report lower levels of physical function and subjective health and higher levels of limitations in activity and pain.
The majority of nurses in this study had a positive attitude to bereavement care. Results show that only 21.6% (n = 141) of the nurses surveyed had bereavement-related training. In contrast, about 89.8% (n = 300) believed they needed to be equipped with relevant knowledge, skills and understanding in the care and support of bereaved parents and more than 88.5% (n = 592) would share their experiences with their colleagues and seek support when feeling under stress. A regression model showed that age, past experience in handling grieving parents, recent ranking and nurses' perceived attitudes to hospital policy and training provided for bereavement care were the factors associated with nurses' attitudes to perinatal bereavement care.
About half of all OR personnel responded (n = 63). Overall levels of concerns were low, with 53% rated no concerns and 42% little concern. Top two reported uses of the video were to see if cases are finished and to see if a room is ready. Viewing the video monitoring system as useful did not reduce levels of concern. Staff in supervisory positions perceived less concern about the system's impact on privacy than did those supervised (p &lt; 0.03). Concerns for patient privacy correlated with concerns for staff privacy and performance monitoring. Technical means such as manipulating image quality helped staff acceptance.
Students' knowledge of sexual health was satisfactory. They were positive in acknowledging the nursing role in sexual health care, but hesitant in taking up an active role in practice. Students' readiness to participate in related activities was below satisfactory. Their perception of inadequate knowledge, feelings of anxiety, worries about colleagues' and clients' possible adverse responses and inadequate exemplars were major factors affecting their readiness. This paper also highlighted some important learning areas and strategies that could help in enhancing students' knowledge and confidence in sexual health care practices.
Significant differences in hope and person-centred attitudes were identified in this study. Nursing assistants, compared with registered nurses (p = 0.02), had significantly lower hope attitudes. Staff over 50 years of age reported significantly lower hope attitudes (p = 0.01) than those under 40 years of age. Staff with 10 and fewer years of work experience reported significantly lower hope attitudes (p = 0.02) than those with more than 10 years of experience. Nurses with specialised training in geriatrics, psychiatry or dementia care had significantly higher hope attitudes, compared with nurses without any special training (p = 0.04). The person-centred attitude was lower among participants who were over 50 years old, compared with their counterparts under the age of 40 (p &lt; or = 0.01).
The subjects, who were 65-88 years old, performed considerably worse at 12 months after hospital discharge in social and physical functioning (means = 61.1, 54.8, respectively) than the age-matched community-dwelling norm (means = 78.7, 69.7, respectively). During the first year after discharge, subjects improved significantly on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 physical component summary scale and role limitations due to physical problems; during the first three months after discharge, they improved significantly on performance of activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living; and from the third to sixth month after discharge, they improved significantly in physical functioning.
The results clarified a core consideration: striking a balance between restorative and palliative care, information and hope, expectations and abilities and intimacy and distance.
Uncertainty varied with cancer stage. At the time of surgery, the patients had moderate levels of uncertainty. There was a significant decrease in uncertainty at the second data collection period before hospital discharge. In these participants, anxiety was significantly associated with past medical history. The participants obtained social support from family members, physicians, nurses, relatives and other patients. Married patients had higher levels of social support than those without a spouse. Significant relationships were found among uncertainty and anxiety and depression. Interestingly, a positive relationship between anxiety and social support after surgery was also identified.
Overall mean scores on the Fat Phobia Scale (3.53 SD 0.47) indicated average levels of fat phobia and mean scores on the Attitudes Toward Obese Adult Patients scale (2.64 SD 0.51) indicated neutral attitudes towards obese patients. Registered nurses had significantly higher levels of fat phobia and more negative attitudes than did student nurses. The majority of participants perceived that obese people liked food, overate, and were shapeless, slow and unattractive. Additionally, over one-half of participants believed that obese adults should be put on a diet while in hospital.
Nursing researchers intent on using a grounded theory methodology should pay attention to the theoretical discussions including theoretical sampling, theoretical sensitivity, constant comparative methods and asking questions, keeping memoranda diagramming, identification of a core category and a resultant explanatory theory. A synthesised approach is developed for use, based on Strauss and Corbin's style of sampling and memoranda writing, but selecting theoretical coding families, that differ from the paradigm model of Strauss and Corbin, from the wide range suggested by Glaser. This led to the development of a multi-step synthesised approach to grounded theory data analysis based on the works of Glaser, Charmaz and Strauss and Corbin.
Beers' criteria identified a total of 69 medicines that were prescribed inappropriately (eight CD and 61 ID) in 65 patients (13%), costing euro824.88 per month while IPET identified 63 potentially inappropriate medicines in 52 (10.4%) patients costing euro381.28 per month.
The prevalence of potentially severe DDIs was 16%, and rose with increasing patient's age and number of drugs prescribed. At multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratios rose from 1.07 (95% CI 1.03-1.11) in patients aged 70-74 to 1.52 (95% CI 1.46-1.60) in those aged 85 or older. Elderly taking more than five drugs on a chronic basis had a statistically significant higher risk of sever DDIs than those receiving less than 3 or 3-5 such drugs.
On average, 2.4 different drugs were prescribed per patient (in total 142 antibiotics, 1599 symptomatic medications, and 56 non-ARTI-medication). Most patients (80%) were treated only with symptomatic medications. Most frequently prescribed symptomatic ARTI-medications were nasal decongestants (39%), cough suppressants (36%), and mucolytics (31%). Patients with prescribed antibiotics received significantly fewer symptomatic medications (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.37). Over 20% of prescriptions prompted at least one intervention by a pharmacist in the dispensing process. A discrepancy between prescribed and dispensed medications was seen in 19% of patients.
A response rate of 37% was achieved. Approximately, one-third of responding pharmacists were presently, or had been, involved in research activities, and generally reported positive experiences. Lack of time and never being approached or not being aware of the opportunities were major barriers to pharmacist participation in research. Approximately, one-third of the pharmacists were not interested in participating in research. There was low usage of publicly available electronic bibliographic databases and of scientific journals. Although there was overwhelming recognition of the value of research to the profession, few pharmacists possessed a good understanding of key terms related to research and evidence-based practice (e.g. P-value or number needed to treat).
One hundred and eighteen patients were recruited to the study [58 patients in intervention group (mean age 63 +/- 10 years old) and 60 in control group (mean age 61 +/- 12 years old)]. Starting with similar baseline levels, the end of study LDL-C and total cholesterol levels for the intervention and control groups were LDL-C: 2.80 +/- 0.89 mmol/L and total cholesterol 4.75 +/- 1.08 mmol/L vs. LDL-C: 3.24 +/- 0.78 mmol/L and total cholesterol 5.18 +/- 0.93 mmol/L, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0015).
The relationship between total and unbound VPA concentrations of patients of 0 years old considerably deviated from the reference, and their unbound VPA concentrations were generally higher compared to the corresponding reference values. It is suggested that the large deviation is related to the fact that the serum albumin concentrations of patients younger than 1 year old tend to be lower than those of patients in other age groups.
No colour change or precipitation in the solutions was observed. Calcium levofolinate infusions were stable when stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C during 1 month after freeze-thaw treatment. Throughout this period, the lower confidence limit of the estimated regression line of concentration-time profile remained above 90% of the initial concentration. Slight change in pH values from 6.52 +/- 0.01 to 6.50 +/- 0.01 during storage time did not affect retention time on HPLC and has no clinical consequence, the solutions remaining in the acceptable range for perfusion (4 &lt;or= pH &lt;or= 10).
Plasma PAF-AH activity (mean +/- SD) was higher in patients homozygous for the Arg92 allele compared to His92 allele carriers (2.21 +/- 0.77 vs. 1.64 +/- 0.68 U/min; P &lt; 0.01; n = 31 and 21 respectively). Baseline plasma PAF-AH activity was higher among day 7 survivors vs. day 7 non-survivors (2.05 +/- 0.75 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.63, P = 0.05).
We detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NK2R gene (i.e., Gly231Glu and Arg375His). The allelic frequencies at amino acid 231 were 36.3% for Gly/Gly, 49.5% for Gly/Glu and 14.3% for Glu/Glu. The allelic frequencies at amino acid 375 were 74.7% for Arg/Arg, 24.2% for Arg/His and 1.1% for His/His. The prevalence of chronic cough in patients with the amino acid 231 genotype was 33.3% in Gly/Gly homozygotes, 24.4% in Gly/Glu heterozygotes and 0% in Glu/Glu homozygotes. There was a statistically significant association between chronic cough and the Glu/Glu allele (P = 0.028) when the data were analyzed with a recessive model. In addition, there was a significant inverse linear association between the number of Glu231 alleles and ACE inhibitor-related cough (P = 0.026). The prevalence of chronic cough in patients with the amino acid 375 genotype was 22.1% in Arg/Arg homozygotes, 31.8% in Arg/His heterozygotes and 0% in His/His homozygotes, although none of these association were statistically significant.
The PM method gave the highest correlation with the measured value using the estimate of renal function obtained by substituting the Jaffe-converted SCR into the Cockcroft-Gault equation. There was no positive or negative bias in the ME and the value was significantly smaller than for other predicted data (P &lt; 0.05). RMSE was also the smallest, indicating that this method increases the predictability of the serum VCM trough level. While, ME showed a negative bias for all values predicted by the Bayesian method, both the ME and RMSE were very small.
We propose one general model and one infectious disease type-specific model. The general model showed that vancomycin clearance (CL) was linearly correlated with estimated creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) when CL(CR) was less than 85 mL/min, as expressed by CL(L/h) = 0.0322 x CL(CR) + 0.32. The distribution volumes of the central and peripheral compartment were different in healthy volunteers and patients with gram-positive infections. The infectious disease type-specific model showed that these differences were more pronounced in patients with pneumonia.
Overall continence rates were 13%, 41%, 63%, and 79% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The rate in group 2 was significantly lower than that in group 1 6 months after surgery (P = 0.0286), and the rate in patients without attempted nerve sparing was significantly lower than that in those with an attempted nerve-sparing procedure at 3 months (P = 0.0084). The rate in group 2 of patients without attempted nerve sparing was significantly lower than that in those with an attempted nerve-sparing procedure at both 3 months (P = 0.0046) and 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.0356).
There were no intraoperative complications. The 90-minute nonselective clamping produced devastating effects, resulting in rapid deterioration into florid renal failure within 72 hours. The 60-minute nonselective clamping group experienced modest but significant rises in both blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Both 60- and 90-minute selective clamping groups performed well, with no significant rises in creatinine over a 7-day period, and no instances of renal failure.
The mean size of the 21 cryoablated tumors was 2.8 cm. No significant bleeding occurred after any biopsy. Of the precryoablation biopsies 75-81% was correctly labeled as precryo, and 48% of the postcryoablation biopsies as postcryo. The diagnostic yield of the three pathologists for precryo biopsies ranged between 67% and 71%, and for postcryo biopsies between 48% and 71% (not statistically different). When combining both types of biopsies, the overall diagnostic yield was 81% for all pathologists. The interobserver agreement was "almost perfect" (kappa = 0.902) for precryo biopsies and "substantial" (kappa = 0.514) for postcryo biopsies.
The overall rating of the URO Mentor was 7.3 on a 10-point scale (1 = poor, 10 = excellent). Regression analysis showed that ratings were not related to previous experience or task performance using the URO Mentor. Of all subjects, 25% rated the realism of URO Mentor as &gt;or=3.5 on a five-point scale, and 82% rated its usefulness as an educational tool as &gt;or=3.5 on a five-point scale. More than 73% of all participants said they would purchase a URO Mentor if financial means were available; participants who needed more time to complete the task were less positive in their answers to this question.
The cystogram showed contrast leaking compatible with bladder perforation in 17 (50%) cases. None of the perforations were recognized intraoperatively by the surgeon. All perforations were extraperitoneal and managed conservatively. There was no significant correlation between the incidence of bladder perforation and the patient age (p = 0.508), the tumor stage (p = 0.998), the tumor grade (p = 0.833), the number of lesions (p = 0.394), and the tumor size (p = 0.651). The only factor that had impact on the development of bladder perforation was tumor localization at the bottom of the bladder (p = 0.035; OR, 6750; 95% CI, 1.14, 39.8).
The median follow-up for HALBNU and OBNU group was 35 and 46 months, respectively. Totally, 40 patients were identified to have pathologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of upper urinary tract. HALBNU group was associated with less blood loss, earlier bowel recovery, less narcotic use, shorter hospital stay, and earlier convalescence. The operative time and complication rate were comparable between the two groups. There was no open conversion in the HALBNU group. The two groups were similar in regard to bladder recurrence rate. The overall, cancer-specific, and bladder-recurrence-free survival were also equivalent between the HALBNU and OBNU group (all p &gt; 0.05).
None of the patients operated experienced a TUR syndrome or a thermal skin lesion. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 12 months (range, 6-24 months); 663 patients had at least 1-year follow-up (66.3%). Urethral stricture occurred in 27 patients (2.7%). Four patients developed a bladder neck contracture after transurethral resection of prostate (1%). Early postoperative clot retention occurred in 21 patients (2.1%), and 11 patients needed one or more transfusion (1.1%). Only six patients (2%) submitted to TUR of a neoplastic lesions at the lateral bladder wall experienced an unwanted trigger of the obturator reflex.
Mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) weight of resected tissue (barbed, 34 +/- 13 g; clips, 34 +/- 11 g; p = 0.6), mean (+/-SD) ischemia time (barbed, 34 +/- 8 minutes; clips, 34 +/- 10 minutes; p = 0.7), and mean (+/-SD) suturing time (barbed, 21 +/- 4 minutes; clips, 22 +/- 7 minutes; p = 0.7) were similar between groups. No animal had a visible hematoma or urinoma at necropsy. On retrograde pyelography, a small urinary leak was found in two kidneys in each group (p = 0.6).
UUO was accompanied by a significant increase in malondialdehyde, NO, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine along with a significant decrease in glutathione levels in the kidney tissue, as well as a significant elevation in iNOS, p38-MAPK, and NF-kB expression. MLT treatment resulted in reduction of the parameters of oxidative stress and the iNOS, p38-MAPK, and NF-kB expression. MLT treatment also reduced the development of leukocyte infiltration and interstitial fibrosis in UUO rats.
The mean stone size in group 1 and group 2 was 3.6 +/- 1.3 cm and 3.5 +/- 1.6 cm, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Stone fragments were removed completely in all of the patients, and the mean operation time was calculated as 48.2 +/- 13.2 minutes in group 1 and 68.1 +/- 22.7 minutes in group 2, with no intraoperative complications (p &lt; 0.01). None of the patients developed urethral stricture disease in the early (postoperative third month) follow-up. Three patients with previously known urethral stricture disease have shown to have the same disease in the late (postoperative 14.4 +/- 5.1 months) follow-up.
HSP70 staining results were significantly lower in the sham group compared with results in the study groups. Immunostaining was significantly higher in the cortical collector tubuli in group 1 than group 1 control (P = 0.006). No significant difference was detected in group 2 compared with group 2 control. In the medullar cortical tubuli, HSP70 staining was significantly higher in group 1 than group 1 control (P = 0.03). It was also higher in group 2 than group 2 control (P = 0.04). The mean HSP70 glomerular staining scores were not statistically significant between each group.
Intraoperative complications were seen in 11.11% of the group 1 patients and in 11.8% of the group 2 patients. Postoperative fever was seen in 33.3% of the patients in group 1 and in 26.5% of the patients in group 2. Mean hospital stay was 85.88 +/- 17.25 hours and 80.20 +/- 17.71 hours in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Mean operating time was 75.41 +/- 17.2 minutes in group 1 and 67.42 +/- 26.25 minutes in group 2. Stone-free rate was 88.9% in the group 1 patients and 79.4% in the group 2 patients. Step 1 access time in group 1 and group 2 was 120.02 +/- 68 seconds and 117.80 +/- 80.52 seconds, respectively (p = 0.002).
The median follow-up was 18 months (range, 1.5-70). Median tumor size was 2.3 cm (range, 1-5.4). Of the 130 (80%) masses with definitive pathology, 70% were renal cell cancer. Five masses had evidence of viable tumor at 4 to 6 weeks posttreatment for a complete initial ablation rate of 97%. Three of these five lesions were endophytic. Five masses (3.3%) showed evidence of local recurrence, and metastases developed in two patients (1.3%). Overall 1- and 3-year recurrence-free survival was 97% and 92%, respectively. Masses that were in the central region and were endophytic had the highest risk for recurrence (hazard ratio, 6.3; p = 0.016).
In patients with renal insufficiency, the mean preoperative Cr level was 2.39 mg/dL and postoperative Cr level was 2.24 mg/dL (P = 0.0497); the mean preoperative CrCl was 32.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and postoperative CrCl was 35.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P = 0.034). In patients with normal function, the mean preoperative Cr level was 0.95 mg/dL and the postoperative Cr level was 0.93 mg/dL (P = 0.33); mean preoperative CrCl was 78.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and postoperative CrCl was 81.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P = 0.19).
Nine of 10 (90%) cases resulted in distal stent migration. Mean time to stent migration was 21 days (range 3-60 d).
For Method 1, the correlation between caliper- and ultrasound-determined stone size was r(2) = 0.71 (P &lt; 0.0001). All but two stone measurements were accurate and precise to within 1 mm. For Method 2, the correlation was r(2) = 0.99 (P &lt; 0.0001), and measurements were accurate and precise to within 0.25 mm.
Overall, similar microorganisms were isolated during each indwell period, although Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains were isolated more frequently during control and triclosan stenting, respectively. Significantly fewer antibiotics were used during triclosan stenting, coinciding with a slightly higher number of positive urine cultures and significantly fewer symptomatic infections. No bacterial isolates developed antibiotic resistance during triclosan stent placement.
During a 10-year period 26 open stone operations were performed in our high-volume center. Indications for open stone removal were complex stone mass with complete or partial staghorn stones, concomitant open surgery, nonfunctioning stone-bearing lower poles, the desire to facilitate future stone passages in cystine stone formers, multiple stones in peripheral calyces, and failed minimal invasive procedures. Procedures performed for stone removal included radial nephrotomies, extended pyelolithotomy, lower pole resection, partial nephrectomy, and ileum ureter replacement. Immediate stone-free rate after a single procedure was 69% (18/26 patients).
Of the 25 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery, 3 patients' operations had to be converted to open surgery because of dense adhesions. Of the 22 cases completed laparoscopically, leakage per vagina occurred in 3 patients. One patient underwent fulguration of residual fistula and was cured, one underwent vaginal repair, and other patient was lost to follow-up.
A panel of 3 biomarkers ranging m/z 3-20 k was selected to establish Decision Tree model by BPS with sensitivity of 91.66% and specificity of 95.83%. The ability to detect NPC patients was evaluated, a sensitivity of 95.0% and specificity of 83.33% were validated in blind testing set.
There are no statistically significant heterogeneity and publication bias between the studies. For IGF- I, the pooled OR and WMD were 0.87(95%CI: 0.60 approximately 1.13,) and -3.04(95%CI: -7.10 approximately 1.02, P = 0.14), respectively. For IGFBP-3, the pooled OR and WMD were 0.68(95%CI: 0.48 approximately 0.88,) and -112.28(95%CI: -165.88 approximately -58.68, P &lt; 0.0001), respectively.
The estimated diameters of Gd-G7 dendrimers were 11 +/- 1 nm and those of Gd-G8 dendrimers were 13 +/- 1 nm. The BTB of ectopic RG-2 gliomas was more permeable than the BTB of orthotopic RG-2 gliomas to all Gd-dendrimer generations except for Gd-G8. The BTB of both ectopic RG-2 gliomas and orthotopic RG-2 gliomas was not permeable to Gd-G8 dendrimers.
The values of all seven parameters were significantly lower in subjects of Groups 1 and 2 than in normal postmenopausal women (P&lt;0.05, respectively). Comparing Groups 1 and 2, 3D-TRAB and 3D-INTGL were significantly lower in postmenopausal women with vertebral fracture(s) [(109.8+/-9.61) and (243.3+/-33.0) mg/cm3, respectively] than in those without [(148.9+/-7.47) and (285.4+/-17.8) mg/cm(3), respectively] (P&lt;0.05, respectively), but no significant differences were evident in AP-SPINE or NECK BMD.
In both orthodromic and antidromic response potentials, carnosine transformed population spikes (PSs) with single spike into epileptiform multiple spikes. In addition, similar to the effect of (-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) antagonist picrotoxin, carnosine decreased paired-pulse stimulating depression significantly. However, no significant change was observed in the spontaneous field potentials during the application of carnosine.
There were less collagen type II expression and more collagen type X expression in the calcified layer of the cartilage endplates and nucleus pulposus in the rats of the aged group than in the young control. There were fewer and smaller afferent vascular buds in the rats of the aged group than in the young control group. The ratio of the non-calcified to the calcified layers in the rats of the aged group significantly decreased, compared with that of the young control group (P&lt;0.01).
Treatment with parthenolide significantly decreased the [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 30%~56% relative to control values in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05). Addition of parthenolide also increased cell population at G(0)/G(1) phase by 19.2%~65.7% (P&lt;0.05) and decreased cell population at S phase by 50.7%~84.8% (P&lt;0.05), which is consistent with its stimulatory effects on p21 and p27. In addition, parthenolide also increased IkappaBalpha expression and reduced Cox-2 expression in a time-dependent manner.
Daytime sleep contributed to retention of source memory rather than item memory in females, whereas males undergoing daytime sleep had a trend towards increased familiarity. For females, however, neither recollection nor familiarity appeared to be influenced by daytime sleep.
Out of the 12 patients, 8 (67%) had uneventful postoperative course and did not require tube for drainage more than 3 months after discharge. In 4 (33%) patients the pleural effusion still recurred after discharge due to end-stage cirrhosis with massive ascites.
Laboratory tests of this patient on admission showed extremely high serum IgE and CA125, a bone marrow aspirate revealed abnormal plasma cells (38.4% of nucleated cells: 16.4% mature and 22% atypical), and in bone marrow biopsy, immunoperoxidase staining showed positive cytoplasmic staining for IgE and kappa light chain within the vast majority of plasma cells. Computed tomography (CT) bone scans indicated wedge shape change and compressive fracture of thoracic vertebrae, and emission computed tomography (ECT) discovered multiple punctiform aggregation of radiation in both cervical ribs and spine. The serum IgE and CA125 gradually decreased to normal limits after eight cycles of chemotherapy. This patient is alive well with an 18-month complete remission.
Based on intention-to-treat analysis, the mean RDQ score during the first year after surgery was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6 to 6.8) for tubular diskectomy and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.2) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.2 to 1.7). At 8 weeks after surgery, the RDQ mean (SE) score was 5.8 (0.4) for tubular diskectomy and 4.9 (0.5) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.4 to 2.1). At 1 year, the RDQ mean (SE) score was 4.7 (0.5) for tubular diskectomy and 3.4 (0.5) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.6) in favor of conventional microdiskectomy. On the visual analog scale, the 1-year between-group mean difference in improvement was 4.2 mm (95% CI, 0.9 to 7.5 mm) for leg pain and 3.5 mm (95% CI, 0.1 to 6.9 mm) for back pain in favor of conventional microdiskectomy. At 1 year, 107 of 156 patients (69%) assigned to tubular diskectomy reported a good recovery vs 120 of 151 patients (79%) assigned to conventional microdiskectomy (odds ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.99]; P = .05).
At 12 months, vaccine serotype pneumococcal carriage was significantly decreased after both PCV-7 schedules, with vaccine serotype pneumococcal carriage rates of 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-30%) and 20% (95% CI, 16%-25%) in the 2-dose and 2 + 1-dose schedule groups, respectively, vs 38% (95% CI, 33%-44%) in the control group (both P &lt; .001). At 18 months, in the 2 + 1-dose schedule group, vaccine serotype pneumococcal carriage had further decreased to 16% (95% CI, 12%-20%) and, at 24 months, to 14% (95% CI, 11%-18%; both P &lt; .001); whereas in the 2-dose schedule group, vaccine serotype pneumococcal carriage had remained stable at 18 months (24%; 95% CI, 20%-29%), but at 24 months had further decreased to 15% (95% CI, 11%-19%; both P &lt; .001). In the control group, vaccine serotype pneumococcal carriage remained around 36% to 38% until 24 months.
In stage 1, 16 genetic loci were associated with 5 echocardiographic traits: 1 each with LV internal dimensions and systolic dysfunction, 3 each with LV mass and wall thickness, and 8 with aortic root size. In stage 2, 5 loci replicated (6q22 locus associated with LV diastolic dimensions, explaining &lt;1% of trait variance; 5q23, 12p12, 12q14, and 17p13 associated with aortic root size, explaining 1%-3% of trait variance).
Thirteen prospective studies with a total of 14 598 participants and 2623 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were included in the meta-analysis. Higher adiponectin levels were monotonically associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risk of type 2 diabetes was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.78) per 1-log microg/mL increment in adiponectin levels. This inverse association was consistently observed in whites, East Asians, Asian Indians, African Americans, and Native Americans and did not differ by adiponectin assay, method of diabetes ascertainment, duration of follow-up, or proportion of women. The estimated absolute risk difference (cases per 1000 person-years) per 1-log microg/mL increment in adiponectin levels was 3.9 for elderly Americans and 30.8 for Americans with impaired glucose tolerance.
Oleic acid and peanut oil high in oleic acid were able to enhance insulin production in INS-1. TNF-alpha inhibited insulin production but pre-treatment with oleic acid reversed this inhibitory effect. The viability status of INS-1 cells treated with TNF-alpha and oleic acid was not affected. Translocation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor transcription factor to the nucleus was elevated in oleic acid treated cells. Finally, type II diabetic mice that were administered a high oleic acid diet derived from peanut oil, had decreased glucose levels compared to animals administered a high fat diet with no oleic acid.
51 malaria deaths were matched with 153 controls, which did not differ by age (median: 35 versus 36 years) and proportion of males (63% versus 63%). On multiple logistic regression analysis, compared with survivors, malaria deaths were more likely to have been admitted with already existing complications [OR = 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-10)], treated at a private facility (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.2-12), received treatment after 48 hours of fever onset (OR = 14, 95% CI = 2.9-64), received chloroquine (OR = 13.3, 95% CI = 3.7-47). Households of the deceased were also more likely to miss bed nets (OR = 6.3, 95% CI = 1.9-24) and DDT spraying (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 2.8-31).
Conserved stevor genes were identified in different P. falciparum isolates from different global locations. Consistent with previous studies, the HVR of the stevor gene family was found to be highly divergent both within and between isolates. Importantly phylogenetic analysis shows some clustering of stevor sequences both within a single parasite clone as well as across different parasite isolates.
Compared to ovariectomized group, femur cortex volume increased significantly in non-ovariectomized group (p=0.016). Compared to non-ovariectomized group, distal femoral metaphyseal and femur midshaft bone mineral density values were significantly lower in ovariectomized group (p=0.047). In ovariectomy+atorvastatin group, whole femur and femur midshaft bone mineral density and three-point bending test maximal load values were significantly higher than ovariectomized group (p=0.049, 0.05, and 0.018). When compared to the ovariectomized group, no significant difference was found with respect to femoral maximum load values in groups treated with risedronate, estrogen, raloxifene and clomiphene (p=0.602, 0.602, 0.75, and 0.927). In ovariectomy+risedronate group, femur midshaft bone mineral density values were significantly higher than the values in ovariectomized group (p=0.023). When compared to ovariectomized group, no significant difference was found with respect to femur midshaft bone mineral density values in groups treated with estrogen, raloxifene and clomiphene (p=0.306, 0.808, and 0.095).
Use of HT increased from 1996 (30.5% current, 43.3% ever) to 2002 (38.2% current, 59.3% ever), and decreased toward 2005 (14.7% current, 35.8% ever). High-dose combinations were still the most used HT products in 2005, although low-dose estrogen products and tibolone had gained market shares. Current use of HT among pre-/perimenopausal women was 9.4% in 1996, 13.2% in 2002 and 0.6% in 2005. Mean duration of current HT use was 3.7 years in 1996, 5.8 years in 2002 and 6.3 years in 2005 (p&lt;0.05). In 2005 current HT use was not associated with formerly known predictors, except age and menopausal status.
Oral DHEA, 50mg/day, was not associated with any effects on blood lipids or insulin resistance. The pattern of breakthrough bleeding did not substantially differ between the DHEA and PL groups and no significant adverse endometrial effects were apparent.
The mean IMT was 0.76+/-0.12 mm (range: 0.53-1.33 mm). IMT was significantly thicker on the far wall than on the near wall and differed among segments (being thickest at the bulb and the narrowest at the ICA). 21.8% had at least one plaque in the carotid artery with most of the plaque found at the bulb area. Systolic blood pressure had statistically significant relationship with IMT that were fairly homogeneous among different segments. Lipids were associated with the CCA and bulb IMT, but not the ICA IMT. Diabetes predicted only CCA IMT. Older age, higher waist-hip-ratio and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significant predictors of plaques at all sites combined.
Participants reported positive attitudes about menopause; more than 90% believed menopause is a normal phase in women's life and more than 40% stated it is a good experience for a woman. Nevertheless, more than half of the sample did not receive any information about menopause and possible therapies, and those who did, often rated it as poor and contrasting. Moreover, clinicians who prescribed HT reported advantages (94%) much more frequently than disadvantages (22%) and risks (39%) in relation to this treatment. Lack of knowledge was associated with women's low educational level and their no or scarce attitude to attend health services.
We were able to confirm AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression, respectively, in breast cancer specimen. Actually, neither insulin serum level nor whole-body insulin resistance showed any effect on insulin/IGF or adiponectin receptor expression in breast cancer. A strong positive correlation between insulin as well as IGF1 receptor and AdipoR1, but not AdipoR2, expression could be observed. Interestingly, AdipoR2 expression significantly correlated with vascular and lymphovascular invasion of breast cancer.
There was a significant difference in the frequency of pharmacological indication using NOF criteria together with the lowest T-score for the three tests (72.8% for lumbar spine+bilateral hips and 71.2% for lumbar spine+unilateral hip; p=0.002). A higher frequency of treatment indication was also observed for lumbar spine+unilateral hip (71.2%) compared to bilateral hips (61.1%) (p&lt;0.001). The discrepancies in treatment appeared to be more evident in women when analyzed by gender distribution.
No significant differences were observed in anthropometric hemodynamic or metabolic parameters between the groups. After adjusting by age and medication usage, some inflammatory markers were significantly higher in +CAD; however no significant differences in FMD or plasma levels of nitrites were observed.
PC-3 are resistant to TRAIL induced apoptosis and have elevated expression of cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP. Combined knockdown sensitised PC-3 to TRAIL induced apoptosis, but not to Etoposide or Tunicmycin, with corresponding increases in caspase activity and PARP cleavage which was inhibited by ZVAD.fmk. Triple knock down decreased proliferation which was confirmed by decreased ID-1 expression.
The clearance rate of 99mTc-tetrofosmin in nonsmokers ranged from 0.38 to 0.63%/min, similar to the previously recorded rate for 99mTc-sestamibi [0.43 (SD 0.083)%/min], but it was not delayed in smokers (range 0.42-0.97%/min). Cyclosporine had no significant effect on 99mTc-sestamibi clearance, although clearance rates in the two women taking the oral contraceptive pill were both fast (0.58 and 0.62%/min).
A total of 578 segments were studied. Sensitivity and specificity of DE-MRI in identifying segments with flow/metabolism match were 61.32 and 95.35%, respectively. Semiquantitatively assessed relative MRI scar tissue correlated well with 99mTc-sestamibi and 18F-FDG SPECT (r = 0.63, P = 0.0284). However, of the 431 segments defined as normal by DE-MRI, 82 segments (19%) were scored as nonviable by 18F-FDG SPECT. During these segments, 48 showed less than 50% reduced 18F-FDG uptake, 25 showed 50-75% reduced 18F-FDG uptake, and nine showed no 18F-FDG uptake.
In total, 17 studies with 571 patients who had recurrent or metastatic DTC and a radioiodine-negative whole-body scan were collected, and the overall patient-based sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET were 0.835 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.791-0.873] and 0.843 (95% CI: 0.791-0.886), respectively. Of these studies, six included lesion-based data, totaling 237 lesions, and the pooled lesion-based sensitivity and specificity were 0.916 (95% CI: 0.863-0.953) and 0.775 (95% CI: 0.660-0.865), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity in the DTC patients who presented with elevated serum thyroglobulin and negative 131I scan were 0.885 (95% CI: 0.828-0.929) and 0.847 (95% CI: 0.715-0.934), respectively. In the six studies where the 165 patients were diagnosed by using FDG-PET/CT, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.935 (95% CI: 0.870-0.973) and 0.839 (95% CI: 0.723-0.920), respectively.
On visual analysis, one grade III glioma lesion showed an increase of K1, k2, and k3 values as observed on their respective images. Four grade IV glioma lesions showed an increase of K1 and k2, 11 of k3, and six of CMR(Glc) on their respective images. Fourteen CNS lymphoma lesions showed an increase of K1, 16 of k3, two of k4, and 14 of CMR(Glc). Both k3 and CMR(Glc) values (mean+/-SD) of CNS lymphoma (0.096+/-0.046 and 77.4+/-37.7, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the normal gray matter (0.059+/-0.015 and 41.3+/-9.3, respectively; P&lt;0.007 and P&lt;0.002, respectively). The k3 value of CNS lymphoma was significantly higher than that of grade III (0.058+/-0.022) and grade IV (0.065+/-0.024) gliomas (P&lt;0.03 and P&lt;0.04, respectively). The CMR(Glc) value of CNS lymphoma was significantly higher than that of grade III (33.8+/-7.8) and grade IV (41.5+/-23.1) gliomas (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.004, respectively). The value of k2 of CNS lymphoma was significantly lower than that of grade IV glioma (P&lt;0.05).
Attenuation correction factors ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 in different parts of the nasal cavity. Alignment of the markers on the teeth and palate with the sagital MR images could be reproduced with accuracies of 1.2 and 1.7 mm, respectively.
The mean EF by echocardiography was significantly higher than QGS and LMC (P&lt;0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively), whereas it was significantly lower than ECTb and LVGTF methods (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively). QGS, ECTb, and LMC correlated significantly in the measurements of the EF with echocardiography (r = 0.844, 0.825, and 0.700, respectively); however, a lower correlation was found between LVGTF and echocardiography (r = 0.595). The agreement limits were (-7.6, 16.1) and (10.5, -15.7) for QGS and ECTb, respectively, whereas it was (-11.6, 19.6) and (-27.9, 15.7) for LMC and LVGTF, respectively. Pair-wise comparison has shown that the EF calculated by QGS was significantly lower than ECTb (P = 0.009) and LVGTF (P&lt;0.0001), whereas it was not different from LMC (P = 0.928). For ECTb, the EF was significantly higher than LMC (P = 0.011), but was not different from LVGTF method (P = 0.173). Further, the EF by LMC was significantly lower than LVGTF method (P&lt;0.0001).
In all 31 cases, tumors were visible on FDG PET and positive for Glut1 and Glut3. The correlation between the percentage of Glut1+ cells and SUVmax was statistically significant across all 31 cases (r = 0.73, P&lt;0.0001, 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.86) and across the 25 cases of nonHodgkin lymphoma (r = 0.71, P&lt;0.0001, 95% confidence interval: 0.44-0.87). There was no statistically significant correlation between the percentage of Glut3+ cells and SUVmax. More importantly, in 16 of 31 cases (52%), only nonlymphomatous, benign cells expressed Glut1 or Glut3.
A significant main effect of time indicated that NBAL increased over the course of the intervention; however, a group-by-time interaction was not observed. Although FIT demonstrated a lower net protein oxidation and higher net protein balance compared to LOW-FIT, neither the effect of time nor a group-by-time interaction was significant for Phe flux, net protein oxidation, or derived whole-body protein synthesis and net protein balance.
The level of IL-10 with an IL-10/IL-6 ratio &gt; 1 was significantly higher in all eyes with IOL. B-cell monoclonality was detected in only 5 of 8 eyes with IOL.
Of these 25 patients diagnosed with EFE, 20 patients (22 eyes) were treated by pars plana vitrectomy. Of the remaining 5 patients (7 eyes), 3 cases (4 eyes) were cured by antifungal drugs through systemic treatment and intravitreal injection, but another 2 cases (3 eyes) were only given intravitreal injection because of severe general conditions. Of the 22 eyes that underwent pars plana vitrectomy, 16 (73%) eyes gained visual acuity of counting fingers or better. Recurrent EFE was happened in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy was repeated in 1 eye, another was subsequently enucleated due to phthisis. Vitreous culture-proven or smear-proven EFE occurred in 27 or 2 eyes, respectively. Candida albicans occurred in 17 of 29 eyes (59%), and other causative organisms were yeast fungus (3 eyes), Aspergillus niger (3 eyes), Actinomyces (2 eyes),Aspergillus flavus (1 eye), and Fusarium (1 eye).
The study included 10 eyes of 9 patients with a median age of 42 years (range, 0-86 years). Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbid risk factor (n = 5, 56%). Nine eyes (90%) were treated with intravitreal antibiotics, and one with pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics. One eye achieved a favorable visual acuity of 20/20; however, 6 eyes developed vision of no light perception, including 2 of evisceration. Two nosocomial K. pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing strains, which demonstrated the resistance to amikacin and ceftazidime.
The concensus conference identified seven signs in the diagnosis of intraocular sarcoidosis: (1) mutton-fat keratic precipitates (KPs)/small granulomatous KPs and/or iris nodules (Koeppe/Busacca), (2) trabecular meshwork (TM) nodules and/or tent-shaped peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), (3) vitreous opacities displaying snowballs/strings of pearls, (4) multiple chorioretinal peripheral lesions (active and/or atrophic), (5) nodular and/or segmental peri-phlebitis (+/- candlewax drippings) and/or retinal macroaneurism in an inflamed eye, 6) optic disc nodule(s)/granuloma(s) and/or solitary choroidal nodule, and (7) bilaterality. The laboratory investigations or investigational procedures that were judged to provide value in the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis in patients having the above intraocular signs included (1) negative tuberculin skin test in a BCG-vaccinated patient or in a patient having had a positive tuberculin skin test previously, (2) elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and/or elevated serum lysozyme, (3) chest x-ray revealing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), (4) abnormal liver enzyme tests, and (5) chest CT scan in patients with a negative chest x-ray result. Four levels of certainty for the diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis (diagnostic criteria) were recommended in patients in whom other possible causes of uveitis had been excluded: (1) biopsy-supported diagnosis with a compatible uveitis was labeled as definite ocular sarcoidosis; (2) if biopsy was not done but chest x-ray was positive showing BHL associated with a compatible uveitis, the condition was labeled as presumed ocular sarcoidosis; (3) if biopsy was not done and the chest x-ray did not show BHL but there were 3 of the above intraocular signs and 2 positive laboratory tests, the condition was labeled as probable ocular sarcoidosis; and (4) if lung biopsy was done and the result was negative but at least 4 of the above signs and 2 positive laboratory investigations were present, the condition was labeled as possible ocular sarcoidosis.
Cranial nerve involvement was the most common neurological manifestation in this series. Among the 27 patients with cranial neuropathy, lower motor neurone facial palsy was the most frequently seen in 19 patients (70.4%). Diplopia was seen in four patients (14.9%). In three patients, this was because of common oculomotor nerve paresis. Uveitis was the most common intraocular manifestation in patients with neurosarcoidosis. The majority of these patients (9, 64.3%) suffered from anterior uveitis, but in 35.7% of them the inflammatory process involved the posterior segment.
Ten (53%) whole-body scans were consistent with sarcoidosis. At the end, subsequent mediastinal biopsies proved sarcoidosis in 3 patients; 2 patients were considered as presumed sarcoidosis, and 6 indeterminate sarcoidosis.
Seven patients (14 eyes) with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis were treated with MMF. The mean duration of treatment was 10 +/- 4.7 months and the average time to control uveitis was 6.7 weeks. The flare-up rate was 51.5 per 100 person-years follow-up. The best-corrected mean logMAR VA revealed improvement in all 14 eyes. The efficacy of MMF in keeping disease activity under control was maintained in 6 patients.
A 57-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C, treated with PEG-IFNalpha -2b and ribavirin for 6 months, noted sudden onset of painless blurred vision in his right eye. The initial visual acuity decreased to 20/60 in the right eye. Fundoscopy of right eye revealed optic disc edema with disc hemorrhage. Visual field examination disclosed inferior altitudinal defect. Relative afferent pupillary defect with poor color vision function was also noted in the right eye. Visual evoked potential demonstrated decreased amplitude in the right eye. A marked resolution of disc edema and improvement of visual acuity to 20/20 were noted at 6 weeks follow-up.
Intravitreal anakinra dose-dependently inhibited CNV growth. Injections given one time resulted in a 26% reduction in CNV; in the once weekly group, a 41% reduction was seen; in the twice-weekly group, a 62% reduction was seen (all p &lt; .001).
IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels were found to be increased significantly in the inflammatory stage of Eales disease as compared to controls (p &lt; .001). IL-1beta levels decreased significantly during the proliferative stage of the disease as compared to the inflammatory stage (p = .03). TNF-alpha levels increased significantly during the proliferative stage as compared to the inflammatory stage (p = .02).
Patients included 10 men and 2 women; 7 were homosexual, 9 HIV-positive. Six patients presented a medical history suggestive of syphilis. All patients presented with iritis and vitritis. Visual acuity improved in 11 patients after treatment.
Intramuscular penicillin lead to resolution of inflammation but both sustained severe loss of vision. Cause-and-effect relationship demonstrated between IVTA and reactivation of syphilis.
Vitreous levels of TA were detected in all samples (range 0.64-168.0 ng/ml). The interval from injection to sampling ranged from 0.5-20 days. Tmax was attained at 0.5 days. TA concentrations were negatively correlated with scleral thickness (P = 0.0184) and depot location (P = 0.0230) but not with PVD status (P = 0.9633).
A 31-year-old man presented with a visual acuity of 3/10 and afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed papillitis and macular edema. Neurology consultation with cranial computerized tomography scan revealed no abnormality. The patient was injected with bevacizumab and triamcinolone intravitreally. One week later, the vision increased to 10/10, macular edema disappeared. One month later, optic disc edema disappeared.
Using targeted silencing of AQP1 gene expression, an impairment in the organization of F-actin and a reduced migration capacity was demonstrated in human endothelial and melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, we showed, for the first time, that AQP1 co-immunoprecipitated with Lin-7. Lin7-GFP experiments confirmed co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, the knock down of AQP1 decreased the level of expression of Lin-7 and beta-catenin and the inhibition of proteasome contrasted partially such a decrease.
In this study, we have identified a new PRL-like gene in non-mammalian vertebrates through bioinformatics and molecular cloning means. Phylogenetic analyses showed that this novel protein is homologous to the previously identified PRL. A receptor transactivation assay further showed that this novel protein could bind to PRL receptor to trigger the downstream post-receptor event, indicating that it is biologically active. In view of its close phylogenetic relationship with PRL and also its ability to activate PRL receptor, we name it as PRL2 and the previously identified PRL as PRL1. All the newly discovered PRL2 sequences possess three conserved disulfide linkages with the exception of the shark PRL2 which has only two. In sharp contrast to the classical PRL1 which is predominantly expressed in the pituitary, PRL2 was found to be mainly expressed in the eye and brain of the zebrafish but not in the pituitary. A largely reduced inner nuclear layer of the retina was observed after morpholino knockdown of zebrafish PRL2, indicating its role on retina development in teleost.
Overall, 39.5% reported having at least one ARI. Of these, 18.5% sought medical care and 33.8% reported having decreased job performance. The rate of self-reported ARI was 15 episodes per 100 person-months among those taking the voluntary survey, and 24.7 episodes per 100 person-months among those taking the clinic health questionnaire. Negative binomial regression analysis found female sex, Navy branch of service and lack of flush toilets to be independently associated with increased rates of ARI. Deployment to OIF, increasing age and higher rank were also positively associated with ARI risk.
Here, eleven PD patients at early stage of the disease taking L-Dopa medication were recruited and underwent two fMRI sessions while performing the WCST: one session while taking their normal dose of medication and the other following overnight dopaminergic medication withdrawal. We found that L-dopa medication helped restoring a normal pattern of activity when matching and not planning was required, by increasing cortical activity in the premotor cortex. This effect was even stronger in the motor loop, i.e. when the putamen was required for controls, when matching following negative feedback. However, the medication did not change the pattern of activity in conditions relying primarily on a cognitive loop, i.e. when the caudate nucleus was required.
In proliferating hNPCs a broad spectrum of K(v) channel subtypes was identified using quantitative real-time PCR with a predominant expression of the A-type channel K(v)4.2. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings K(v) currents were separated into a large transient component characteristic for fast-inactivating A-type potassium channels (I(A)) and a small, sustained component produced by delayed-rectifying channels (I(K)). During differentiation the expression of I(A) as well as A-type channel transcripts dramatically decreased, while I(K) producing delayed-rectifiers were upregulated. Both K(v) currents were differentially inhibited by selective neurotoxins like phrixotoxin-1 and alpha-dendrotoxin as well as by antagonists like 4-aminopyridine, ammoniumchloride, tetraethylammonium chloride and quinidine. In viability and proliferation assays chronic inhibition of the A-type currents severely disturbed the cell cycle and precluded proper hNPC proliferation, while the blockade of delayed-rectifiers by alpha-dendrotoxin increased proliferation.
We performed a SNP-array based genome-wide copy number analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines, to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion, which may harbour critical disease genes. A series of novel and established medulloblastoma defects were detected (MYC amplification (n = 4), 17q21.31 high-level gain (n = 1); 9p21.1-p21.3 (n = 1) and 6q23.1 (n = 1) homozygous deletion). Most notably, a novel recurrent region of genomic amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 was identified (n = 2), and selected for further investigation. Additional analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (iFISH), PCR-based mapping and SNP-array revealed this novel amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 is independent of MYC amplification at 8q24.21, and is unique to medulloblastoma in over 800 cancer cell lines assessed from different tumour types, suggesting it contains key genes specifically involved in medulloblastoma development. Detailed mapping identified a 3Mb common minimal region of amplification harbouring 3 coding genes (ZFAT1, LOC286094, KHDRBS3) and two genes encoding micro-RNAs (hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d). Of these, only expression of hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 correlated with copy number status, and all three of these transcripts also displayed evidence of elevated expression in sub-sets of primary medulloblastomas, measured relative to the normal cerebellum.
The evolution of regions flanking 116 functional linear motif instances was studied. The conservation of the amino acid sequence and order/disorder tendency of those regions was related to presence/absence of the instance. For the majority of the analysed instances, the pairs of sequences conserving the linear motif were also observed to maintain a similar local structural tendency and/or to have higher local sequence conservation when compared to pairs of sequences where one is missing the linear motif. Furthermore, those instances have a higher chance to co-evolve with the neighbouring residues in comparison to the distant ones. Those findings are supported by examples where the regulation of the linear motif-mediated interaction has been shown to depend on the modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) at neighbouring positions or is thought to benefit from the binding versatility of disordered regions.
In the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, health status was measured by a frailty index based on the number of health deficits. Exercise was classified as either high or low/no exercise, using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Health status and survival were re-assessed at 5 years. Of 6297 eligible participants, 5555 had complete data. Across all grades of frailty, death rates for both men and women aged over 75 who exercised were similar to their peers aged 65 to 75 who did not exercise. In addition, while all those who exercised had a greater chance of improving their health status, the greatest benefits were in those who were more frail (e.g. improvement or stability was observed in 34% of high exercisers versus 26% of low/no exercisers for those with 2 deficits compared with 40% of high exercisers versus 22% of low/no exercisers for those with 9 deficits at baseline).
We analyzed the initial events during migration of two osteogenic cell types, rat calvarial and human SaOS-2 cells, exposed to strong (10-15 V/cm) and weak (&lt; or = 5 V/cm) dcEFs. Cell elongation and perpendicular orientation to the EF vector occurred in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. Calvarial osteoblasts migrated to the cathode as they formed new filopodia or lamellipodia and reorganized their cytoskeleton on the cathodal side. SaOS-2 cells showed similar responses except towards the anode. Strong dcEFs triggered a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels, whereas a steady state level of intracellular calcium was observed in weaker fields. Interestingly, we found that dcEF-induced intracellular calcium elevation was initiated with a local rise on opposite sides in calvarial and SaOS-2 cells, which may explain their preferred directionality. In calcium-free conditions, dcEFs induced neither intracellular calcium elevation nor directed migration, indicating an important role for calcium ions. Blocking studies using cadmium chloride revealed that voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are involved in dcEF-induced intracellular calcium elevation.
We describe three new dinosaurs from the late Early Cretaceous (latest Albian) Winton Formation of eastern Australia, including; Wintonotitan wattsi gen. et sp. nov., a basal titanosauriform; Diamantinasaurus matildae gen. et sp. nov., a derived lithostrotian titanosaur; and Australovenator wintonensis gen. et sp. nov., an allosauroid. We compare an isolated astragalus from the Early Cretaceous of southern Australia; formerly identified as Allosaurus sp., and conclude that it most-likely represents Australovenator sp.
Here we generated mice in which the txnrd1 gene, encoding Txnrd1, was specifically disrupted in all parenchymal hepatocytes. Txnrd1-deficient livers exhibited a transcriptome response in which 56 mRNAs were induced and 12 were repressed. Based on the global hybridization profile, this represented only 0.3% of the liver transcriptome. Since most liver mRNAs were unaffected, compensatory responses were evidently effective. Nuclear pre-mRNA levels indicated the response was transcriptional. Twenty-one of the induced genes contained known antioxidant response elements (AREs), which are binding sites for the oxidative and chemical stress-induced transcription factor Nrf2. Txnrd1-deficient livers showed increased accumulation of nuclear Nrf2 protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation on the endogenous nqo1 and aox1 promoters in fibroblasts indicated that Txnrd1 ablation triggered in vivo assembly of Nrf2 on each.
DAT on blood samples detected anti-Leishmania antibodies in 6 samples (6.9%). Two out of 87 (2.3%) blood samples tested were PCR positive, giving an amplification product of 560 bp. The two positive samples by PCR were also positive by DAT. However, none of the 33 lymph nodes aspirates were Leishmania positive when screened by microscopy, culture and genus-specific PCR. The dog-baited trap significantly attracted the highest number of P. orientalis and sand fly species (P &lt; 0.001). This was followed by the Egyptian mongoose baited trap and less frequently by the genet baited trap.
Serial serum NSE and S-100B concentrations over 96 hrs and PAI-1 at 24 hrs were measured in children (age &lt;18 yrs) who had return of spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest. Neurologic outcome was prospectively categorized as poor if the change in pre- to postarrest pediatric cerebral performance category was &gt; or =2. Biomarker concentrations were compared between outcome groups and between survival groups using longitudinal analysis correcting for multiple comparisons. Median levels (25th, 75th percentiles) are reported. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed at all time points. Biomarker concentrations showed statistically significant differences. Of the 35 patients, neurologic outcomes were poor in 19, with 15 deaths. Median NSE concentrations differed by outcome when measured at &gt; or =48 hrs, and by survival at &gt; or =24 hrs. S-100B concentrations were not significantly associated with neurologic outcome. S-100B levels were associated with survival outcome at &gt; or =48 hrs. PAI-1 levels were not significantly associated with either neurologic or survival outcomes.
The perceived need for rescue therapy may be partly motivated by the moral imperative to save a child's life. However, allowing rescue therapy in a trial is misconceived and inconsistent with equipoise regarding the efficacy of the study drug. If rescue therapy is permitted, intention-to-treat analysis can only compare immediate vs. delayed use of the study drug. When rescue therapy is beneficial, the observed treatment effect is substantially diminished from true effect of the study drug, leading to increased sample size and thereby placing more children at risk (18 "excess" placebo-arm deaths occur in our hypothetical example). Analysis of a trial incorporating rescue therapy cannot definitively assess overall efficacy of the agent, or distinguish beneficial or harmful treatment effects related to timing of drug use.
A total of 28,171 independent ECMO courses were included for analysis, of which 14.9% were associated with a mechanical component failure. Duration of ECMO, age group of patient, era of ECMO, and indication for ECMO were all associated with mechanical component failure. From our predictive model, we observed a continuous nonlinear relation suggesting increasing probability of mechanical component failure with increasing duration of ECMO support.
Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and admission into a trauma resuscitation room (TRR) were used as proxy markers for the center management aggressiveness. Centers which admitted to TRR and monitored ICP when indicated in &gt;75% of cases were called aggressive centers. Children with an ICP monitoring indication admitted to a TRR and monitored, as well as those without an indication treated in a TRR, were judged appropriately managed. A poor outcome at pediatric intensive care unit discharge was defined as a difference between the baseline and discharge pediatric overall performance category above 3, or a hospital death. Children with traumatic brain injury appropriately managed in a less-aggressive center were more likely to have a poor outcome than those appropriately managed in an aggressive center (odds ratio 7.56, 95% confidence interval 1.5-38.4), after adjustment for severity, age, and type of road user.
Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for central line-associated BSI. In a secondary analysis, risk factors for central line-associated BSI in those cases who underwent cardiac surgery were sought. During the study period, 67 central line-associated BSIs occurred in 61 patients. Independent risk factors for central line-associated BSI were nonelective admission for medical management (odds ratio [OR] = 6.51 [1.58-26.78]), the presence of noncardiac comorbidities (OR = 4.95 [1.49-16.49]), initial absolute neutrophil count &lt;5000 cells/uL (OR = 6.17 [1.39-27.48]), blood product exposure &gt; or =3 units (OR = 5.56 [1.35-22.87]), central line days &gt; or =7 (OR = 6.06 [1.65-21.83]), and use of hydrocortisone (OR = 28.94 [2.55-330.37]). In those patients who underwent cardiac surgery (n = 37 cases and 108 controls), independent risk factors for central line-associated BSI were admission weight &lt; or =5 kg (OR = 3.13 [1.01-9.68]), Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score &gt; or =15 (OR = 3.44 [1.19-9.92]), blood product exposure &gt; or =3 units (OR = 3.38 [1.28-11.76]), and mechanical ventilation for &gt; or =7 days (OR = 4.06 [1.33-12.40]).
The median duration of total parenteral nutrition was significantly higher in the control group (116 vs. 51 hrs; p = 0.03) compared with the study group. The median time to achieve recommended daily allowance of calories defined as 108 kcal/kg per day was significantly reduced in the study group (9 vs. 13 days; p = 0.01). Despite the rapid advancement of enteral feedings on the algorithm, there was no incidence of NEC in the study group compared with 11% in the control group.
Umbilical cord blood samples were obtained for the determination of IL-6, IL-10, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and protein carbonyls levels. Neonates were divided prospectively in two groups: control and septic. All parameters were higher in septic patients compared with control (IL-6 184.6 +/- 72.7 vs. 58.9 +/- 19.1, p &lt; 0.01; IL-10 171.4 +/- 59.2 vs. 79.9 +/- 17.9, p &lt; 0.01; TBARS 10.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.5, p &lt; 0.01; protein carbonyls 2.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.5, p &lt; 0.01, respectively, septic vs. control). In addition, these parameters were higher in the subgroup of culture-positive septic patients compared with control. IL-6 and TBARS had equivalent areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (0.88); IL-10 (0.80) and protein carbonyls (0.73) had lower areas. Multivariate logistic regression comparing IL-6 and TBARS in terms of the relative risk for neonatal sepsis demonstrated that TBARS was a better predictor, being independently associated with neonatal sepsis.
We determined the number of patients, age &lt; or =17 yrs, who were eligible for organ donation and the consent rate by age. Each hospital in which donation occurred was characterized by the presence of a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), a pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship, solid organ transplant programs, and level I trauma programs. Additional information was obtained on the number of donation after cardiac death donors and eligible donors lost due to medical examiner refusals and deterioration before organ recovery. The number of reported eligible pediatric donors in 2005 was 1330. The consent rate was 69.2% with higher consent rates in eligible donors 12 yrs of age and older. Eligible donors were spread across a large number of hospitals with few having ten or more eligible donors. Variability exists among hospitals in consent rate and number of donors per 100 PICU beds. The presence of a level I trauma program and/or a PCCM fellowship was associated with higher numbers of donors per 100 PICU beds. Ninety-four eligible donors were lost before recovery of organs due to medical examiner denials or cardiac arrest. Donation after cardiac death accounted for 37 donors.
Without an ETT airleak, the lowest flow of 0.5 L/min led to the most accurate determination of Pflex regardless of ETT size or set Pflex (p &lt; 0.001). When a 25% leak was introduced, accuracy of measured Pflex depended on both ETT size (p &lt; 0.001) and flow rate (p &lt; 0.001). Optimum flow rates for Pflex determination were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 L/min at Pflex of 5 cm H2O, and 2.0, 3.5, and 4.5 L/min at 10 cm H2O for 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mm ETTs, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).
There were no acute adverse effects noted. Children had temporary cessation of ongoing refractory status epilepticus, termination of ongoing nonconvulsive status epilepticus, cessation of acute repetitive seizures, or reduction in epileptiform discharges with clinical correlate.
We defined acute neurologic injury as the occurrence of brain death, brain infarction, or intracranial hemorrhage identified by ultrasound or computerized tomography imaging. Of 682 E-CPR patients, 147 (22%) patients had acute neurologic injury. Brain death occurred in 74 (11%), cerebral infarction in 45 (7%), and intracranial hemorrhage in 45 (7%). The in-hospital mortality rate in patients with acute neurologic injury was 89%. In a multivariable logistic regression model, pre-ECMO factors including cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.28-0.76]) and pre-ECMO blood pH &gt; or =6.865 (&gt; or =6.865-7.120; OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.25-0.94]; pH &gt;7.120; OR 0.47 [95% CI 0.26-0.85]) compared with pH &lt;6.865 were associated with decreased odds of neurologic injury. During ECMO, neurologic injury was associated with ECMO complications including pulmonary hemorrhage (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.1-3.4), dialysis use (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.4-4.0), and CPR during ECMO support (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.6-3.8).
One hundred fifty-eight trauma patients younger than 16 years requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation were identified in 3388 pediatric trauma admissions from the period 1995-2006. Drownings and poisonings were excluded. The registry identified 14 potential VAPs, of which, on detailed review, 7 were true cases. The VAP rate for pediatric trauma patients was 0.2% overall or 4.4% of those mechanically ventilated. In addition, ventilator days were available in the registry from 2003 forward and the rate in ventilator days was found to be 13.83/1000. Although higher than the overall pediatric intensive care unit VAP rate (5.93/1000 ventilator days), the pediatric trauma VAP rate was substantially lower than the VAP rate in adult trauma patients (58.25/1000 ventilator days). On chart review, six of the seven patients were male and older than 10 years (mean age, 11.9 years). All seven patients with VAP were blunt trauma victims with head injury (mean initial Glasgow Coma Score, 5.6) with Injury Severity Scores over 25 (mean, 32.1). Pulmonary contusion was present in four of the seven. Although the in-hospital mortality rate of ventilated pediatric trauma patients was 17.1%, there was no mortality in those with VAP.
The number of patients, treatment days, total amount of vancomycin/linezolid, total intensive care unit admissions, and patient days were recorded. We used the World Health Organization definition of DDD for vancomycin and linezolid (2000 and 1200 mg, respectively). The prescribed daily dose for each intensive care unit was calculated for each year by dividing the total amount of the medication administered by the total number of treatment days. The drug use densities were then calculated as the total DDDs, prescribed daily doses, and days of drug use per 100 patient days. The vancomycin use densities were significantly different among the three intensive care units when compared by each method. They were significantly lower in all three units when expressed as DDDs per 100 patient days. The vancomycin drug use density in the pediatric intensive care unit was significantly decreased during 2005 compared with 2004 by all three methods.
Two school-aged boys presented with features of, and were initially treated, for community-acquired pneumonia. However, the disease course was rapidly progressive to fulminant respiratory failure and because both failed conventional intensive care management, they were referred to ECMO support. Although both died of evolving multiorgan failure, ECMO support allowed open lung biopsy leading to diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus pneumonia and chronic granulomatous disease.
Successful removal of the intact catheter, avoiding catheter disruption and embolization.
Articles in four categories were included based on selected chapters in the neurointensive care section of the textbook, using the specific chapter heading in the textbook, namely, head and spinal cord trauma, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, status epilepticus, and cerebrovascular disease and stroke.
Regarding the P300 components of the target detection, there were significant increases of amplitudes in 5 of 10 patients (50%) at week 16 comparing with week 0. Regarding the N400 components of the word recognition, there were significant increases of amplitudes in 4 of 10 patients (40%) at week 16 comparing with week 0.
Regression analyses showed an association between changes in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and olanzapine dose changes: patients with a lack of effectiveness were more likely to have their dose increased, whereas patients with good treatment response were more likely to have a dose decrease. Improvement in tardive dyskinesia was associated with dose increase or no change (p=0.034) and worsening of sexual problems was associated with dose decrease (p=0.001). Conversely, an increase in olanzapine dose was associated with subsequent clinical improvement (CGI), but dose adjustment had no significant effects on tolerability outcomes.
COMT genotype was significantly associated with signal discrimination index d' in schizophrenia. The Val/Val genotype was associated with the highest and the Met/Met genotype with the lowest scores; heterozygous individuals displayed an intermediate performance.
621 patients were analysed (n=107 valproate, n=514 olanzapine). Both groups improved from baseline to 6 weeks in mean YMRS and HAMD-5 total scores, with greater mean improvements in the olanzapine compared with the valproate group. Olanzapine was associated with more weight gain and less gastrointestinal difficulties than valproate.
Mean observation time was 11.1 [SD+/-9.7] months. Mean CGI-Severity scores improved significantly (p=0.003, d=0.76) from 5.3 (baseline) to 4.5 (endpoint; last observation carried forward (LOCF)). CGI-Improvement scores decreased from 3.7 (after 1 month) to 3.3 (endpoint; LOCF) (p=0.212, d=0.45).
The mean C (max) and AUC of paliperidone were slightly higher and paliperidone clearance was slightly lower following co-administration of paliperidone ER with paroxetine. There was a ratio of geometric treatment means of 116.48% for AUC (infinity) [90% CI: 104.49-129.84]. However, the increase in total exposure to paliperidone was not considered clinically relevant. The incidence of adverse events was lower when subjects received the combination of paliperidone ER and paroxetine compared with paroxetine alone.
Thirty-eight CNVs were identified. Among them, the distributions of copy number loss CNVs on 8p23.1 (odds ratio: 5.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.7-14.5, P=0.003) and on 17p11.2 (odds ratio: uncalculable because of zero cell, P=0.008) were found to be significantly different between ASD and control groups. DEFENSIN family occurs in a cluster at 8p23.1 region. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and capillary electrophoresis-single-strand conformational polymorphism coherently showed reduced copy number of DEFENSIN in cases with 8p23.1 copy number loss CNV, which validated microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization results; but there are no known coding genes in the CNV on 17p11.2.
MTHFR 677T-allele frequency was found to be higher in autistic children compared with nonautistic children (16.3 vs. 6.5%) with 2.79-fold increased risk for autism [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58-4.93]. The frequencies of MTRR 66A allele (12.7 vs. 21.0%) and SHMT 1420T allele (27.9 vs. 45.3%) were lower in autistic group compared with nonautistic group with odds ratios 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35-0.86) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.31-0.62), respectively, indicating reduced risk. MTHFR 1298C-allele frequency was similar in both the groups (53.3 vs. 53.6%) and hence individually not associated with any risk. However, this allele was found to act additively in the presence of MTHFR 677T allele as evidenced by 8.11-fold (95% CI: 2.84-22.92) risk associated with MTHFR 677CT+TT/1298AC+CC genotypes cumulatively.
As compared with LL/LS, the SS genotype of the 5-HTTLPR was associated with a lower antidepressant efficacy in depressed women (79 vs. 50% responders, P = 0.035). This result was shown with both SSRI and non-SSRI antidepressants. The logistic regression performed in women showed that response to treatment was related to genotype (odds ratio=0.15; 95% confidence interval=0.03-0.85; P = 0.03) and not to other variables. No effect of 5-HTTLPR was found in depressed men.
There was no overall excess of common ROHs among bipolar individuals. With one exception, the haplotypes accounting for the ROHs appeared to be distributed according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. One ROH was individually more common among cases (uncorrected P = 0.0003). This ROH spanned the chromosome 2p23.3 gene ITSN2 (the gene for intersectin 2 isoform 2). However, inspection of the homozygous haplotypes and haplotype-based tests for association failed to provide a clearer understanding of why this ROH was occurring more commonly.
Ten sequence variations were identified, five of which were not previously described. None of these DNA changes was within the GCLM coding sequence and in-silico analysis failed to indicate functional impairment induced by these variations. Furthermore, screening of normal controls and downstream statistical analyses revealed no significant relationship of any of these DNA variants with schizophrenia.
Results indicated average levels for radiologic science educator feelings of emotional exhaustion, low levels for their feelings of depersonalization and average levels for their feelings of personal accomplishment. A statistically significant result was found between all 3 subscales of the MBI and the reported health status.
The review of the 28 emergency preparedness plans confirmed that most colleges are prepared for basic emergencies, but lack the key components needed to successfully address mass-casualty events. Only 5 (18%) of the 28 institutions addressed policies concerning school shootings.
While household wealth, education and demographic and health covariates had strong relationships with place of delivery, the effects of women's overall autonomy, decision-making and freedom of movement were rather weak. Among middle to least poor households, all three measures of women's autonomy were associated with place of delivery, and in the expected direction; whereas among the poorest women, they were strong and counter-intuitive. Finally, the study showed that autonomy may not be a major mediator of the link between education and use of health services for delivery.
Out of a total of 578 vitreous sampling attempts, a total of 550 positive diagnostic vitreous samples were collected from 157 eyes of 144 patients. There were a total of 28 "dry" samples in 19 subjects (13 females and 6 males). The rate of dry sample was 4.8% (28 of 578). Complications included transient vitreous hemorrhage (n = 3), transient intraocular inflammation (n = 3), localized, chronic retinal detachment (n = 1). None of the complications resulted in permanent visual sequelae. These complications were no different than those expected from intravitreal injection alone.
Allelic or genotype association tests yielded significant results at P &lt; 0.001. We observed that homozygous risk genotypes (TT in rs10490924 and AA in rs11200638) were more strongly associated with AMD than the heterozygous genotypes (GT in rs10490924 and geographic atrophy in rs11200638) for both SNPs. Comparisons of the odds ratios for genotypes revealed that there is ethnic disparity in AMD prevalence, even within the Chinese population. The haplotype TA, comprising both the SNPs, was identified as an at-risk factor and was significantly associated with AMD, whereas the protective haplotype GG was significantly overrepresented in the controls (P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of the TA haplotype was relatively higher in the Chinese population than in the white population in both groups, whereas the frequency of the GG haplotype was relatively lower in the Chinese controls than in the white and Japanese controls.
Patients with typical AMD maintained visual acuity for 2 years after photodynamic therapy. For patients with AMD + PCV, the visual acuity was maintained during the first year but started decreasing by 0.09 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units per 3 months (95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.06-0.14) after 1 year. Moreover, patients with AMD + PCV had 82% higher risk of a recurrence of active lesions for each increase in 3 months of follow-up time after 1 year; this suggested that the risk of recurrence had increased later in follow-up after 1 year. Recurrence of active PCV lesions and massive subretinal hemorrhages were the main reasons for the late worsening of visual acuity.
Genomic profiles were analyzed to identify regions of loss of heterozygosity or amplification. Two major subclasses of RB tumors were defined by the presence (n = 18) or absence (n = 7) of loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 13. Loss of heterozygosity in most cases was the result of copy-neutral events caused by mitotic recombination and mitotic nondisjunction. Tumors harbored novel regions of amplification at 1q44, 3p25, 11q14, 11q25, 14q23, 15q21, 16p13, 17p11.2, 19q13, and 20q13, whereas regions of loss included 6q22, 7q21, and 21q2.
Visual acuity was 20/25 or worse in 226 (76.6%) eyes and 20/40 or worse in 172 (58.3%) eyes at presentation. At the last follow-up visit, visual acuity was 20/25 or less in 125 (42.3%) eyes and 20/40 or less in 70 (23.7%) eyes. Topical or systemic therapy was given in nearly half of the cases (54.4%). Overall, 87 (71.9%) eyes were symptomatic at last follow-up visit. Finally, measured visual acuity was more than 20/25 in 20 (87.5%) eyes without foveal involvement at presentation and in 28 (39.2%) eyes with foveal involvement.
The advantage of the IVI technique is the ability to maximize intraocular levels of medications and to avoid the toxicities associated with systemic treatment. Intravitreal injection has been used to deliver several types of pharmacological agents into the vitreous cavity: antiinfective and antiinflammatory medications, immunomodulators, anticancer agents, gas, antivascular endothelial growth factor, and several others. The goal of this review is to provide a detailed description of the properties of numerous therapeutic agents that can be delivered through IVI, potential complications of the technique, and recommendations to avoid side effects.
Fifty-two eyes with a BRVO and 13 eyes with an HRVO received intravitreal bevacizumab at baseline. Visual acuity improved by a mean of 12 letters at 1 month (n = 51; P &lt; 0.001), 13 letters at 3 months (n = 61; P &lt; 0.001), 13 letters at 6 months (n = 42; P &lt; 0.001), 14 letters at 9 months (n = 27; P &lt; 0.001), and 15 letters at 12 months (n = 17; P = 0.015). The mean optical coherence tomography (OCT) thickness decreased by 184 microm (P &lt; 0.001), 131 microm (P &lt; 0.001), 161 microm (P &lt; 0.001), 158 microm (P = 0.002), and 205 microm (P = 0.002) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, respectively. The mean number of injections was 1.4, 2.1, 2.7, and 3.1, and 3.3 at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, respectively. No ocular or systemic adverse events were observed.
Patients in the bevacizumab group were significantly younger than those in the untreated group (average age, 46.4 vs. 58.4 years) and were more likely to have 20-gauge instrumentation (58% vs. 36%). An average of 9.6 days passed between injection and surgery. Early (4-6 weeks) rebleed rates were 15% versus 13% in the bevacizumab and untreated groups, respectively, and not statistically different. Preoperative (7/200 vs. count finger at 4'), 1-month postoperative (20/200(-3) vs. 20/150), and 3-month postoperative visual acuity (20/100(-3) vs. 20/100(+2)) were not statistically different between groups. No statistical difference was found in rebleed rates regarding the gauge of vitrectomy.
Fifty-two subjects were enrolled in the study. Patients with CRVO (n = 41) who were treated with rt-PA exhibited a significant improvement in best-corrected visual acuity compared with those who received hemodilution (P &lt; 0.0001). At 1-year follow-up, the proportion of eyes with CRVO achieving an improvement in visual acuity of three or more lines was 45% after treatment with rt-PA and 21% after hemodilution therapy. The median final best-corrected visual acuity among CRVO patients given rt-PA was 20/60 (light perception, 20/15) compared with 20/400 (light perception, 20/20) in the hemodilution group. There were no significant differences among patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (n = 11). We observed no serious adverse events. No significant differences were found regarding the development of ocular neovascularization.
A significant although not related improvement of BCVA and retinal sensitivity was seen after 1 month and 2 months of follow-up. Anatomic improvement only involved the neuroretina, although significant changes of central choroidal thickness were not detected.
All patients had 9 months of follow-up. Complete resolution of angiographic leakage was achieved in all eyes at 9 months. A significant improvement in the mean BCVA was observed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months after combined treatment (P = 0.004). Visual acuity improved in 62.5% and was stable in 37.5% of cases. No patients had a decrease in BCVA of three or more lines during follow-up. Mean central macular thickness was significantly reduced in all patients (P &lt; 0.0001) as controlled at 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 9-month intervals from initial treatment. The mean number of injections for the 9 months were 3.2 +/- 0.4. No ocular complications or systemic events developed.
Twenty-three eyes of 21 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean change in C/D was -0.012 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.053 to 0.029) for the treated group and -0.006 (95% CI, -0.106 to 0.095) for the control group, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.90). The mean change in C/D for eyes receiving &lt; or =5 injections (n = 9) was 0.003 (95% CI, -0.089 to 0.095) in the treated group and 0.054 (95% CI, -0.033 to 0.142) in the control group, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.33). In eyes receiving &gt;5 injections (n = 14), the mean change in C/D was -0.021 (95% CI, -0.095 to 0.052) in the treated group and -0.057 (95% CI, -0.231 to 0.116) in the control group, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.70).
Eleven of 22 assessable membranes showed a positive reaction for Factor P. The average percentage of Factor P-positive cells per membrane ranged from 0.65% to 4.09%. The duration of visual loss was significantly longer (8.6 +/- 2.7 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.8 months), and the size of postoperative measured area of atrophic retinal pigment epithelium was larger (27.6 +/- 7.6 vs. 15.0 +/- 6.9 mm2) in patients with Factor P-positive membranes compared with Factor P-negative ones.
The RTVue yielded greater retinal thickness measurements in nearly all macular subfields compared with the StratusOCT. Even after accounting for differences in segmentation algorithms, significant disparities were still evident with the RTVue measurements less than those of the StratusOCT at the foveal center. On both machines, the macula was thinnest at the fovea and thickest within the 3 mm ring. There were some consistent regional variations in macular thickness evident on both OCTs. Compared with the StratusOCT, the RTVue generally had lower coefficients of variation and higher intraclass coefficients, suggesting better reproducibility. Age and gender also appeared to be important determinants in some macular thickness parameters.
Sixteen eyes from eight patients with cuticular drusen were scanned. Areas of decreased retinal thickness overlying drusen were best visualized using the three-dimensional retinal thickness map. The distribution and sawtooth pattern of cuticular drusen were best visualized using three-dimensional retinal pigment epithelium segmentation. Of the 16 eyes, 13 had SRF within the macula. In the eyes with macular SRF, characteristic excrescences were present along the outer retina and attenuation of the photoreceptor inner and outer segment boundary were observed in many areas. In areas where the retina was detached, the retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane complex appeared nodular or attenuated. The volumetric measurements of the SRF were performed using a manual segmentation with a 1.11% mean difference between repeated measurements on the same day (range, 0.47-1.68%; standard deviation, 0.55%).
Complete data were available from 17 patients. Statistically significant reductions were seen between baseline and posttreatment in PHP contour areas and OCT metrics, except for maximum retinal thickness. Mean best-corrected visual acuity improved by two letters, but this was not statistically significant. Change in PHP parameters correlated strongly with change in subretinal fluid height, with P values of &lt;0.01 for most comparisons. Change in best-corrected visual acuity did not correlate with change in any of the OCT metrics or PHP distortion map areas.
In the 13 patients identified, all cases followed intraocular surgery, and 1 was associated with a recurrent corneal ulcer. Of the 1,751 organisms isolated from intraocular culture during the study period, 244 were Gram negative. Proteus species represented 5.3% of gram-negative organisms and &lt;1% of the total isolates identified. Endophthalmitis developed 2 days to 14 days postoperatively (median, 3.5 days), and patients were observed 1 month to 61 months after presentation (median, 17 months). Presenting vision ranged from light perception to 20/200. Ten patients had positive cultures for Proteus mirabilis, and three patients had a growth of Proteus morganii. Four patients (31%) were infected with &gt;1 organism. All Proteus isolates were sensitive to the antibiotics clinically administered, including cefazolin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and the fluoroquinolones. Five patients (38%) initially received intravitreal injections of antibiotics alone, 1 received an anterior chamber washout in combination with intravitreal injections, and 7 patients (54%) received pars plana vitrectomy in combination with intravitreal injections. Two of the patients (15%) who received vitrectomies had either an intraocular lens or retained nuclear fragments removed. Six patients (46%) received additional antibiotic injections during the clinical course, and 6 patients (46%) underwent additional surgical procedures. Final visual acuity was better than light perception in 5 patients (38%) and was light perception or no light perception in 8 patients (62%). Only 4 patients (31%) had a final vision acuity &gt; or =5/200.
Inside the foveal area, fundus autofluorescence did not detect abnormalities. Outside the ring, fundus autofluorescence revealed hypoautofluorescence compatible with the photoreceptor/retinal pigment epithelium degeneration. Spectral-domain OCT inside the ring, in the area of normal foveal fundus autofluorescence, revealed an intact retinal structure in all eyes and total retinal thickness values that were within normal limits. Across the ring, inner/outer segment junction disruption was observed and the outer nuclear layer was decreased in thickness in a centrifugal direction in all eyes. Outside the hyperautofluorescent ring, the inner/outer segment junction and the outer nuclear layer appeared to be absent and there were signs of retinal pigment epithelium degeneration.
Practice 1: In Year 1, 24 patients with choroidal neovascularization were referred for LV, and in Year 2, only 12 were referred. There was a trend for those patients referred in Year 2 to have worse visual acuity and Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity than those in Year 1. In Years 1 and 2, 18 and 11 patients with other conditions were referred for LV consultation, respectively. For these patients without choroidal neovascularization, there was no significant difference between groups for visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. Practice 2: The mean best-corrected visual acuity of patients with bilateral choroidal neovascularization referred was 20/145, and no patient had visual acuity &gt; or =20/100.
Among the 469 individuals, the data showed that thrombotic risk allele frequencies - 1691A (4.9%), 20210A (1.8%), 677T (41.7%) and 1298C (24.8%) - were similar to other Caucasians, but significantly different from mainland Portuguese (chi2, p &lt; 0.001). The combined analysis of these variants identified twenty-two different genetic profiles (genotype order: F5, F2, MTHFR C677T and A1298C). Complete homozygosity for all wild-type alleles (GG GG CC AA) was present in 11.7%, being GG GG CT AA (22.4%) the most frequent profile. The results also demonstrated that 12.4% (58 out of 469) of São Miguel islanders have increased genetic predisposition to thrombosis. Subsequently, we evaluated these individuals for their warfarin response genetic profiles. The data showed that seven out of fifty-eight individuals are poor metabolizers (two with CYP2C9*2/*2 and five with CYP2C9*2/*3 genotypes). VKORC1 polymorphism analysis identified twelve individuals (20.7%) with AA genotype, who probably will require lower doses of warfarin. The joint analysis of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 revealed that 79.3% (46 out of 58) of the individuals carry at least one polymorphism in these genes. Within these, twenty-five individuals (43.1%) need intermediate and/or low doses of warfarin, if treatment is started.
Median tumor size was 7 mm (range 1-10 mm). PMC was multifocal in 156 cases (35%) and bilateral in 60 cases (13.5%). Extrathyroidal tumor extension (pT3) and neck lymph node metastasis (pN1) were present in 133 (30%) and 182 (40.9%) patients, respectively. Capsular invasion without extrathyroidal tumor extension was observed in 39 (8.7%) patients. Mean follow-up was 5.3 (range 1-26) years. Seventeen (3.8%) patients had recurrence or persistence of disease: neck recurrence (NR) in 12 (2.7%), distant metastasis (DM) in four (0.9%), NR + DM in one (0.2%). One patient (0.2%) died of the disease. Capsular invasion, extrathyroidal tumor extension (pT3), and neck lymph node metastasis at presentation (pN1) were the only independent risk factors for NR and/or DM occurrence (p &lt; 0.05). Patients not showing these features, who were treated with loboisthmusectomy only, never experienced disease recurrence.
Six patients had a cytological diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer, which was confirmed at surgery. There were no false-negative specimens, and cytological diagnostic accuracy was 93.7%. The inadequate rate was only 1.9%.
Nodules greater than 10 mm were associated with the higher frequency of irregular margins (p = 0.001), longer period of latency (p = 0.016), and bilateral lymph node involvement (p = 0.025). Irregular tumor margins correlated with the shorter period of latency (p = 0.009) and unilateral nodal disease (p = 0.010). Hypoechoic nodules were observed more frequently in female patients (p = 0.012), in the absence of halo (p = 0.003) or calcifications (p = 0.005). Hypoechogenicity also correlated with the shorter latency (p = 0.015) and younger age of patients (p = 0.048).
Nineteen studies and 20 series were identified. The following are reported and recalculated means, respectively: for sensitivity, 81% and 86%; for specificity, 81% and 62%; for accuracy, 77% and 71%; for positive predictive value, 65% and 50%; for negative predictive value, 84% and 93%; for FN rates, 13% and 14%; for FP rates, 10% and 38%. FP rates had a mean of 1.4% when recalculated considering only malignant FNAB as positive tests. Specificity and FP rates had statistically significant differences between the means of reported and recalculated values.
The in vivo experiments demonstrated that FRTL-Tc cells injected intrathyroidally grew faster than those injected subcutaneously, and that admixed fibroblasts enhanced growth of subcutaneous FRTL-Tc tumors, indicating that the intrathyroidal milieu, particularly in the presence of fibroblasts, confer growth-promoting advantage to thyroid carcinoma cells. This in vivo growth-promoting effect of fibroblasts on FRTL-Tc cells was duplicated in the in vitro experiments using the fibroblast-conditioned medium. Thus, our data demonstrate that this effect is mediated by soluble factor(s), is reversible, and is comparable to that of 10% fetal bovine serum. However, normal FRTL5 cells did not respond to the fibroblast-conditioned medium. Furthermore, high- and low-dose irradiation enhanced and suppressed, respectively, the in vivo fibroblast-mediated growth promotion. This effect was, however, not observed in the in vitro experiment with conditioned medium or even that allowing cell-cell contact.
The trough values of D2 activity and mRNA at 2100 hour were increased by the treatment with metyrapone. On the other hand, the peak values of D2 activity and mRNA were decreased by the treatment with DEX. D2 activity and mRNA in cultured rat VSMCs were increased by the addition of 10(-3) M dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate [(Bu)(2)cAMP]. The increments were reduced by coincubation with 10(-6) M DEX.
During periods 1, 2, and 3, the mean age at diagnosis was 37.7 +/- 12.3, 42.4 +/- 14.53, and 44.1 +/- 14.9 years (p = 0.001), respectively, and the male to female ratio was similar. The prevalence of FTC was 22.7%, 28.1%, and 6.5%, respectively. In period 3, 51.6% of the PTCs were microcarcinomas (microPTC) &lt;or=10 mm; these patients tended to be older (p = 0.09). Microcarcinomas were more frequent among patients operated for pre-existing multinodular goiter (MNG) or prominent hot nodule compared to pre-existing single cold nodule (p &lt; 0.001, Pearson chi(2)). In period 3, 88% of the microPTC diagnoses were incidental. Of the incidental microPTCs detected in MNG, 25% had capsular invasion, 4.5% had lymph node involvement, and 3.6% had soft tissue involvement.
Patients with normal thyroid function who were treated with fluoxetine demonstrated a significant reduction of T(3) after 15 and 30 days of treatment (p = 0.034 and p = 0.011) and a significant reduction of T(4) throughout the intervention period (p = 0.04 after 15 days; p = 0.015 after 30 days; and p = 0.029 after 90 days). However, all thyroid parameters remained within the euthyroid range. No changes were observed among hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine replacement therapy who were treated with either SSRI. The degree of improvement in depression symptoms (HAM-D rating scale) after 90 days of SSRI treatment was correlated with T(3) levels reduction among patients with normal thyroid function randomized for sertraline and among patients with hypothyroidism randomized for fluoxetine. T(3) levels remained within the euthyroid range during the study period.
FT(4) reference intervals were very similar for males and females of all ages and ranged between 1.3 and 2.4 ng/dL for children 1 to 18 years old. FT(4) reference intervals for 1- to 12-month-old infants were 1.3-2.8 ng/dL. These 2.5 to 97.5 percentile intervals were much tighter than reference intervals obtained using immunoassay platforms 0.48-2.78 ng/dL for males and 0.85-2.09 ng/dL for females. Similarly, FT(3) intervals were consistent and similar for males and females and for all ages, ranging between 1.5 pg/mL and approximately 6.0 pg/mL for children 1 month of age to 18 years old.
Re-examination of the previously described constitutively active TSHR germline mutations did not show constitutive activity for R310C and N670S as tested in COS-7 cells and confirmed constitutive activity for the other eight mutations. However, mutant N670S showed a slight but significant increase of basal activity measured by linear regression analysis when analyzed in HEK(GT) cells transiently transfected with pcDNA but not with the pSVL vector. This was not the case for R310C.
There was no appreciable change in PRA for patients receiving a first 0 HLA-A, -B, -DR, or 0 HLA-A, -B-mismatched kidney transplant; contrariwise, there was a significant increase in PRA by increasing HLA mismatch of the first transplant. Only 10% of patients became sensitized after a 0 HLA-A, -B-mismatched transplant, whereas the proportion rose up to 37% with increasing HLA mismatches. Other factors, notably younger age and African American race, also contributed to a higher PRA at relisting.
The mtDNA sequence of the HV1 region was found to be invariant among MGH miniature swine of different haplotypes, despite 25 years of selective breeding of the sublines of this colony. In contrast, swine derived by nuclear transfer into outbred oocytes differed in the HV1 region sequence from each other and from MGH swine. Renal transplants from standard, inbred MGH swine to their MHC-identical knockout counterparts derived from outbred oocytes were rejected within 2 weeks, whereas transplants in the reverse direction were accepted for over 30 days.
The BLI signal from the encapsulated cells remained robust postinsertion and in one animal persisted for up to 1 year. In contrast, the control animal that received unencapsulated cells exhibited a complete loss of cell signal within 14 days.
EC induced by TNBS had characteristics similar to those of Crohn's disease. A large number of bromodeoxyuridine- labeled HSCs or MSCs were detected on days 7, 14, and 21 posttransplantation. Sex-determining region of Y chromosomes (sry) was found in all EC regions, but not in control and normal tissues. A clear localization of Y chromosomes in the colons of EC rat was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that HSCs or MSCs had similar population ability. When HSCs and MSCs were combined, gross morphologic scores significantly improved 21 days post-SCT compared with the control without SCT, but only slightly better than that of HSCs or MSCs alone.
A single injection of adenosine at the time of transplantation ameliorated hyperglycemia of diabetic mice receiving 200 syngenic islets with suppression of interferon (IFN)-gamma production of hepatic NKT cells and neutrophils, while that of control did not. The IFN-gamma production of NKT cells and neutrophils in the liver of mice treated with alpha-galactosylceramide, a synthetic ligand of NKT cells was suppressed by adenosine. The beneficial effect of adenosine was also observed for BALB/c islet allografts when alloimmune rejection was prevented by anti-CD4 antibody.
Neither positive family history of type 2 DM nor overweight at baseline could predict islet function outcomes after ITx. However, when both risk factors were grouped, the "type 2 DM phenotype" was associated with earlier islet graft failure (mean estimate graft survival 25.7+/-9.1 vs. 54.1+/-5.2 months, P=0.022). These results were sustained after adjustments for confounding variables (OR 5.20, 95% CI 1.12-24.0).
We observed that TAC significantly increases plasma TG concentrations and reduces LPL plasma concentration and activity in renal transplant patients, independent of any lipid lowering drug treatment patients received.
One hundred and thirty-nine patients were randomized (IE 65, DE 74). The primary composite endpoint: biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, DGF, wound healing events, or lost to follow-up at month 3, occurred in 36 IE patients (55.4%) and 47 DE patients (63.5%, P=0.387). The incidence of DGF was similar between groups (IE 24.6%, DE 24.3%; n.s.). Wound healing events of any type occurred in 40.0% and 41.9% of IE and DE patients (n.s.); events relating to initial transplant surgery occurred in 36.9% IE patients and 37.8% DE patients (n.s.), most of which were fluid collections. Study drug was discontinued due to adverse events or graft loss in 13 IE (20.0%) and 17 DE patients (23.0%).
Twenty-one of the 22 UK renal transplant centers used prophylactic oral valganciclovir for 3 months posttransplant in the D+R- transplants, having done so for a median of 4 years. Unadjusted data showed that D+R+ rather than D+R- transplants had the lowest patient and allograft survivals at 3 years posttransplant. However, after adjustment for donor age, there was no significant effect of donor and recipient CMV serostatus on allograft or patient survival.
There were 33 cases with BKN, biopsied at 16.4+/-2.8 months and 66 matched controls with biopsies at 21.5+/-2.1 months posttransplant (P=0.16). After adjusting for sex, race, retransplant status, diabetes, donor source, and induction agent, TAC blood level was associated with increased risk of BKN (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.7, P=0.03), whereas MMF dose was not (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99-1.0, P=0.2). Moreover, prednisone dose was also found to be a significant risk factor for BKN (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.4, P=0.02).
A total of 7% and 19% patients were positive for BKV in serum and urine, respectively. Sustained BK viruria showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for BK viremia and was associated with significantly higher level of BK load than the patients with transient viruria (P&lt;0.01). Interestingly, BK viremia was preceded by BK viruria: the peak of viral load and number of positive patients appeared during the third and fifth posttransplant month for urine and serum, respectively. BKVAN diagnosed in 21.4% of patient with persistent BK viruria appeared 5 and 11 weeks after BKV reactivation in serum and urine, respectively, was detected.
A total of 23.3% of patients were active on the transplant waiting list.
Overall LSM success rate (valid shots/total shots) was 0.929+/-0.119. There was a significant negative relationship between the LSM success rate and thoracic belt thickness (P&lt;0.0021). The interquartile range to median value rate of LSMs remained high (21.1%+/-11.2%) compared with the preoperative values (15.6%+/-8.5%), even 1 month after the transplantation. Among LDLT recipients (n=24), the LSM value was highest in the first postoperative week and declined thereafter. Recipients with complications had significantly higher LSM values than those without complications in the fourth postoperative week (POW4; P=0.0066) and POW5 or later (P=0.0028). All cases of acute cellular rejection had a concomitant sharp rise in liver stiffness and a rapidly depleted portal flow.
Preoperative problems were reported in 2 donors, intraoperative problems in 27, and postoperative complications in 270. In total, 299 donors (8.4%) suffered complications related to liver donation. Postoperative complications included biliary complications in 3.0%, reoperation in 1.3%, severe after-effects in two (0.06%), and death (apparently related to donor surgery) in one donor (0.03%). The incidence of postoperative complications in left and right lobe donors was 8.7% and 9.4%, respectively.
In total, 176 patients were randomized (everolimus 92, MMF 84). Mean creatinine clearance was 72.5+/-27.9 and 76.8+/-32.1 mL/min at baseline, 65.4+/-24.7 and 72.2+/-26.2 mL/min at month 6, and 68.7+/-27.7 and 71.8+/-29.8 mL/min at month 12 with everolimus and MMF, respectively. The primary endpoint was not met since calculated CrCl at month 6 posttransplant was 6.9 mL/min lower with everolimus, exceeding the predefined margin of 6 mL/min. However, by month 12 the between-group difference had narrowed versus baseline (3.1 mL/min). All efficacy endpoints were noninferior for everolimus versus MMF. The 12-month incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection International Heart and Lung Transplantation grade more than or equal to 3A was 21 of 92 (22.8%) with everolimus and 25 of 84 (29.8%) with MMF. Adverse events were consistent with class effects including less-frequent cytomegalovirus infection with everolimus (4 [4.4%]) than MMF (14 [16.9%], P=0.01).
UVL patients exhibited normal ATP release to Concanavalin A (ConA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA; 190+/-86 ng/mL, 328+/-163 ng/mL) and detectable EBV-specific (37+/-34 ng/mL) ATP responses. LVL patients displayed significantly stronger responses to ConA (373+/-174 ng/mL), PHA (498+/-196 ng/mL) and EBV (152+/-179 ng/mL), when compared with UVL or to HVL patients (ConA 185+/-114 ng/mL, PHA 318+/-173 ng/mL, and EBV 33+/-42 ng/mL). Moreover, HVL patients displayed significant inverse correlation between CD4+ T-cell ATP levels and EBV loads.
Electronic monitoring of 226 patients confirmed that 123,487 measures were performed. Period prevalence was 0.76 measures per patient day and decreased significantly over time (P&lt;0.0001). During follow-up, BOS was developed in 32% of patients; 5% received a second transplant, and mortality rate was 19%. Kaplan-Meier event-free analysis showed decreased freedom from BOS time in nonadherers (30%) compared with good (43%) or moderate adherers (19%) (log rank 6.008; P&lt;0.014) and a tendency toward lower retransplantation rates (log rank 3.14; P&lt;0.07). Mantel Cox regression revealed no impact of adherence on patient survival.
There were a total of 142 cases (cumulative incidence 0.4%) of PCP after kidney transplantation during the study period. By using multivariate analysis with Cox regression, expanded criteria donor, donation after cardiac death, and earlier year of transplant were associated with development of PCP disease. Induction immunosuppression and acute rejections were not associated with risk for PCP infections. However, based on adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), maintenance immunosuppression regimens containing the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus (AHR 3.60, confidence interval [CI] 2.03-6.39), Neoral and mycophenolate mofetil (AHR 2.09, CI 1.31-3.31), and sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (AHR 2.77, CI 1.40-5.47), were associated with development of PCP. As a time dependent variable, PCP was associated with an increased risk of both graft loss and death.
319 studies were included. Ninety-two (29%) reported HTE analysis; another 88 (28%) reported subgroup analysis only, without examining HTE formally. Major covariates examined included individual risk factors associated with prognosis, responsiveness to treatment, or vulnerability to adverse effects of treatment (56%); gender (30%); age (29%); study site or center (29%); and race/ethnicity (7%). Journal of publication and sample size were significant independent predictors of HTE analysis (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).
During the 30 days post-vaccination, there were 128 and 94 potential convulsion cases among the 31,298 children in the MMRV and MMR+V cohorts, respectively. After review of available medical charts and adjudication, there were 84 cases of confirmed febrile convulsion, 44 (1.41/1000) and 40 (1.28/1000) in the MMRV and MMR+V cohorts, respectively (RR=1.10, 95% CI=0.72, 1.69). In days 5-12 following vaccination, a pre-specified period of interest, the respective numbers were 22 (0.70/1000) and 10 (0.32/1000) (RR=2.20, 95% CI=1.04, 4.65).
Sequences with limited similarity to known picornaviruses were detected in a stool sample collected in Australia from a child with acute diarrhea. Using a combination of mass sequencing, RT-PCR, 5' RACE and 3' RACE, a 6383 bp fragment of the viral genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely related to, members of the genus Kobuvirus. We have tentatively named this novel virus klassevirus 1. We also detected klassevirus 1 by RT-PCR in a diarrhea specimen collected from a patient in St. Louis, United States as well as in untreated sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain.
Twenty-four-hour, day and night average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 24-hour, day and night SBP load in the two groups were lowered as compared with before treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The effects of Western medicine combined with SXC on blood pressure depression were better than those of Western medicine (P &lt; 0.05). Western medicine combined with SXC had a significant influence on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with Western medicine (P &lt; 0.05). The heart rate in the SXC group was reduced as compared with before treatment and the routine group (P &lt; 0.05). Trough to peak ratio in SXC group was higher than that in the routine group, while there was no significant difference in smoothness index between the two groups. Morning surge in blood pressure in the two groups was improved as compared with before treatment (P &lt; 0.05), and there was a significant difference in morning surge in blood pressure between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05).
There were no significant differences in the values of PT, APTT, INR, FIB and D-D between the two groups before operation, and there were no significant changes in APTT and INR after operation in the two groups. The values of PT decreased in the two groups on day 3 after operation, while there was no significant difference between the two groups. The value of PT in the control group decreased gradually with the extension of postoperation time (P &lt; 0.05), while the PT value in the Xuesaitong group did not change significantly, and there was significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). The values of FIB and D-D increased instantly after operation in the two groups as compared with those before operation (P &lt; 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the two groups. With the extension of postoperation time, the values of FIB and D-D increased gradually in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the D-D value on day 3 after operation increased, but the D-D values on day 5 and day 7 after operation decreased gradually in the Xuesaitong group (P &lt; 0.05). The occurrence rate of deep vein thrombosis on day 7 after operation in the Xuesaitong group was lower than that in the control group.
After the treatment, the lower limb artery intima-media thickness and artery plaque area in the treatment group decreased obviously as compared with those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Color Doppler flow imaging showed that the percentage of patients with uniphase wave decreased from 26.67% (8/30) to 6.67% (2/30) in the treatment group (P &lt; 0.05), and from 26.67% (8/30) to 16.67% (5/30) in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) as compared with those before the treatment, and there was also a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of serum TC and LDL in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).
There were 105 syndrome types after initial standardization, and the common syndrome types were kidney yin deficiency, deficiency of liver and kidney yin, stagnation of liver qi, and deficiency of both kidney yin and yang. Six syndrome elements of the disease location were extracted, among which the common elements were kidney, liver, spleen and heart. Seventeen syndrome elements of the disease characteristics were extracted, among which the common elements were yin deficiency, qi stagnation, qi deficiency, yang deficiency and deficiency. Syndrome types of stagnation of liver qi, deficiency of spleen and kidney, and qi stagnation were more frequently diagnosed during perimenopausal period, while the syndrome type of kidney yin deficiency was more frequently diagnosed during postmenopausal period, and the kidney was the main disease location. The distribution characteristics of the other syndrome types and elements were similar during the two periods.
The ROI activation induced by needling of SJ5 or SJ5 plus GB34 was all relatively concentrated (activation rate more than 4 or activation point more than 10) on bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. There were no significant differences in ROI activation rates of brain regions between the two groups. ROI activation points showed that needling at SJ5 could activate the right cerebellum specifically (P &lt; 0.05, vs SJ5 plus GB34), while needling at SJ5 plus GB34 could activate the left parietal and occipital lobes and bilateral basal ganglion more effectively than activate the other brain regions (P &lt; 0.05, vs SJ5). ROI activation strength showed that needling at SJ5 plus GB34 could more strongly activate the right cerebellum (P &lt; 0.05, vs SJ5).
Ultraviolet irradiation, heat-shock, and paraquat treatment could significantly reduce egg number in uterus and brood size, increase generation time, and suppress activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase of the treated wild-type N2 nematodes. Administration of BKT did not cause toxic or altered effects on reproduction under wild-type background in C. elegans. However, BKT administration at higher concentrations could not only effectively alleviate the reproductive defects induced by ultraviolet irradiation, heat-shock, and paraquat treatment, but also increase the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities suppressed by ultraviolet irradiation, heat-shock, and paraquat treatment as compared with the control. Moreover, administration of BKT at higher concentrations could largely recover the reproductive defects formed in mev-1 mutant nematodes with elevated oxidative stress.
The different combinations of active ingredients showed anti-inflammatory effect with different degree, and the predicted values of OD varied from 0.115 to 0.170. The maximum anti-inflammatory effect was from the combination of naringin, neohesperidin, paeoniflorin and platycodin, better than that of the saline group (P &lt; 0.01). However, there was no significant difference as compared with the aspirin group (P &gt; 0.05). Paeoniflorin showed a dominant contribution to the formula, and platycodin the least. The combination of all active components exhibited synergism.
Compared with the normal group, there were physiological changes associated with hepatic steatosis and inflammation in liver tissues in the untreated group as observed by oil red O staining and HE staining. The TG, FFA, malony1-CoA, FAS, and ACCase concentrations in liver tissues in the untreated group were elevated significantly. While the contents of ADP in serum and AdipoR2, CPT-1 and AMPK in liver tissues in the untreated group were decreased markedly. The pathological damages in each QSHYD-treated group were significantly less than those in the untreated group. The TG and FFA contents in liver tissues in each QSHYD-treated group were significantly decreased. The FAS, ACCase and malonyl-CoA concentrations in liver tissues of the high QSHYD-treated group were reduced markedly as compared with the untreated group. High- and medium-dose of QSHYD could significantly increase ADP content in serum and AMPK, CPT-1 and AdipoR2 contents in liver tissues.
Compared with normal saline, Liangxue Jiedu Decoction could significantly inhibit the mitosis of mouse vaginal epithelium (P &lt; 0.01) and promote the formation of granular layers in mouse tail-scale epidermis (P &lt; 0.01).
After 8- and 12-week administration, the GSI and TIS in the catechin group were much less than those in the untreated group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). MVDs around glomerulus and tubule at the end of the 8th and 12th week in the untreated group and the catechin group were much less than those in the sham-operated group (P &lt; 0.01). The ACE activities and Ang II contents in plasma and renal cortices in the catechin group were much less than those in the untreated group (P &lt; 0.01). By Pearson correlation analysis, we found that MVD had negative correlation with GSI, TIS, Ang II content, and ACE activity (P &lt; 0.01), however, the ACE activity and Ang II content had positive correlation with GSI, TIS (P &lt; 0.01).
The contents of neural active substances including DA, GABA, Glu, and beta-EP in the perfusate from the rats' MPOA during different stages of sexual cycle showed some regular changes. After the perfusate was microinjected respectively into the MPOA of the ovariectomized rats, the changes of animal vaginal exfoliated cells and serum E2 level showed the similar four-stage cycle characteristics as normal rats; the changes of vaginal exfoliated cells and serum E2 level of the ovariectomized rats without electro-acupuncture treatment showed the acupuncture-like effects following the microinjection of AP in the MPOA.
GFAP-delta expression was observed in CA4 and CA1 astrocytes in HS with less frequent labelling in the granule cell layer, even where granule cell dispersion was present. No significant labelling was noted in the subiculum in HS cases or in any subfields in non-HS epilepsy cases. Balloon cells in FCDIIB and hemimegalencephaly, giant cells in TSC and the astrocytic component of gangliogliomas showed immunoreactivity, colocalizing with conventional GFAP. No neuronal expression for GFAP-delta was seen in any of the pathologies. Quantitative analysis in 10 FCDIIB and five TSC cases revealed greater numbers of GFAP-delta-positive balloon cells than conventional GFAP. There was no GFAP-delta expression within nodular heterotopia.
Preoperative patients' characteristics (sex, gender, BMI, ASA status, prior surgery, comorbidities, colonic disease) were comparable. Conversion rate in Group A was 9.1%. Operative incidents were comparable in both groups. Operative duration was not significantly shorter in Group B (195 min versus 160 min in Group B). Mortality rate was 2.2 % and O % in group A and B, respectively. Overall morbidity rate was 11.4 % and 28.6 % in Group A and B, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in Group A (4.8 days) as compared to Group B (6.8 days), respectively. An efficiency analysis was performed and demonstrated that laparoscopic reversal did not generate a significant additional cost.
In all of the BB &gt;or= 1 individuals (cortical neurofibrillary changes were present at least in the transentorhinal region) and in more than 1/5 of the BB = 0 individuals neurofibrillary changes were detected in the supratrochlear subnucleus of the DR.
In this study, we have compared the efficiency of adenovirus, five serotypes of AAV2, VSVG-pseudotyped lentivirus, and nonviral plasmid/liposome DNA vectors to deliver the green fluorescence protein reporter gene to human early EPCs to determine efficacy and vector-related cell toxicity. Adenovirus proved most effective with efficiencies of up to 80% with low levels of cell death. Lower levels of expression were seen with other vectors. Electroporation proved unsuitable at the parameters tested. We have also identified at least two distinct subpopulations that exist in the heterogeneous parent EPC culture, one of which is amenable to transduction with adenovirus and one that is not. In addition, adenoviral transduction did not disrupt the ability of the cells to incorporate into endothelial structures in vitro.
Compared with non-bereaved, acutely bereaved had increased symptoms of depression (26.7 +/- 1.7 vs 5.9 +/- 0.7, P &lt; 0.001), anxiety (47.4 +/- 2.0 vs 28.2 +/- 1.4, P &lt; 0.001) and anger (median 16.0 vs 15.0, P &lt; 0.001). Greater depressive symptoms were associated with being unprepared for the death, decreased sleep duration and younger age. Acutely, bereaved slept less than non-bereaved (5.8 +/- 0.2 vs 7.2 +/- 0.2 h, P &lt; 0.001). Reduced sleep time was associated with increased anger and depression and decreased satisfaction with social support. Compared with the non-bereaved, the acutely bereaved had higher cortisol (median 306 vs 266, P= 0.003), reduced appetite (P &lt; 0.001) and lower total cholesterol (median 4.9 vs 5.4, P= 0.006) and low-density lipoprotein (median 2.4 vs 2.9, P &lt; 0.001).
The prevalence of mental disorder was lowest among those who migrated as adults compared with those who migrated as young children (child migrants) or New Zealand-born (NZ born) migrant descendants in both Pacific and other ethnic groups. While Pacific people have higher rates of disorder than Others, many of the observed differences between Pacific and Others were explained by population differences in age and sex. Service use in the last 12 months by people with a disorder was low among Pacific peoples overall, but spec fically among older migrants. Older Pacific migrants with a disorder had particularly low use of specialist mental health services.
Results indicate that all participants were at a similar level of overall cognitive functioning but Pacific peoples scored significantly lower than both Măori and Pakeha on two Language subtests and significantly lower than Pakeha on the Memory subtest. Individual handicap increased following TBI and decreased following rehabilitation, with no significant difference across cultures and suggesting good efficacy of rehabilitation.
High nurturance was significantly associated with Samoan ethnicity and post school qualifications, and low nurturance was significantly associated with post-natal depression, alcohol consumption and gambling. At the univariate level, high discipline scores were significantly associated with gambling, postnatal depression and lack of alignment to either Pacific or to European traditions. However the strongest association with discipline was the ethnicity variable with Tongan mothers reporting significantly higher disciplinary behaviours that all other ethnicities.
Approximately half (51.3%) of all Pacific people did not currently drink compared to 6.2% of the European population. Of 'non-drinkers'--never Drinking'was significantly more common in Pacific (40%) compared to Europeans (13%) p &lt; 0.0001. Ex-drinkers comprised 6.3% of the 'ever-drank' population for European compared to 27.6% for Pacific. The majority of Pacific men and women drinkers (&gt;60%) consumed alcohol 'weekly' or 'less than weekly'. In contrast the majority of European men and women drinkers (&gt;60%) consumed alcohol '2-3 days per week' or 'daily'. European men were significantly more likely to drink wine and spirits, and European women were significantly more likely to drink wine than their Pacific counterparts. Pacific drinkers consumed an average of 6.9 drinks on a typical occasion and 82 mls of pure alcohol per week, compared to 3.6 drinks and 126 mls per week for Europeans.
A previous paper and this one confirm that Cook Islanders experience high prevalence of mental disorders. However the difference is more attributable to their population age and gender structure or being New Zealand-born than from ethnicity. The prevalence was higher among New Zealand-born Cook Islanders than those born in the Cook Islands. Those born in the Islands with a disorder were less likely to have used a health service for their mental health compared with others and much less likely to have visited a specialist mental health service. From MHINC, twelve month data on use of mental health services shows: high use of acute inpatient and Forensic mental health services by Cook Island clients but similar levels of community mental health services. Cook Islands clients were more commonly diagnosed with bipolar psychotic or schizophrenic disorders. They were also more likely to be diagnosed with a substance disorder.
For the training CSH setting, t(defib) the AED model was significantly faster than the conventional model (1.3 vs. 2.0 minutes, p &lt;0.001, 95% CI of the mean difference = 0.39-1.1). In the combat environment, t(defib) was between 2.2 and 8.4 minutes faster for the AED system. The AED system was found to be significantly easier to use than the standard model.
two hundred (77%) of the 260 invited amputees were willing and able to come back for follow-up. Ninety-six of these patients (48%) were unilateral transtibial amputation. The average follow-up was 17.4 years (range 15-22 years). Land mines were the leading cause of war injury necessitating a transtibial amputation (68%). The most common symptoms about their amputated limbs were phantom sensations (54%), phantom pain (17%), and stump pain (42%). Lower back pain, contralateral (nonamputated limb) knee pain, and ipsilateral (amputated limb) knee pain were reported by 44%, 38%, and 13% of subjects, respectively. Sixty-five percent of patients were employed or had been employed for multiple years after their war injury. All patients were married, and 97% had children. Fifty-four percent of amputees reported psychological problems; 26% were currently utilizing psychological support services.
35 patients were included in this study with 20 for a diagnosis of persistent ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Only an active smoking defined a population at risk in these high medical selective soldiers. The agreement between the initial and the final diagnosis was excellent for STEMI but remains perfectible for NSTEMI.
Patients were predominantly female (23 female vs. 5 male; mean age 52.2 years). In 61% of cases MDH was associated with either CIU or AD. NSAIDs and antibiotics were the major causes of HIDR, both implied in 54% of subjects. The proportions of MDH-subjects with positive ASST and APST were 46.4% and 28.6%, respectively. All patients with MDH+AD+CIU (4/4) presented apositive ASST.
during a walking trip from Piazza Loreto (outside) to Piazza Duomo (inside Ecopass zone) and back, mean (SD) PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 were 31 (6), 68 (24) and 93 (37) microg/m3 inside the Ecopass zone, and 32 (6), 70 (37), 98 (48) microg/m3 in the outer area, respectively (not significant, ns). In another trip walking from Piazza Buonarroti to Piazza Duomo and back, PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 levels were 56 (2), 183 (14) and 245 (28) microg/m3 inside the Ecopass zone, and 58 (3), 197 (13) and 247 (24) microg/m3 in the outer area, respectively (ns). In the measurements taken from a car moving in three ring belts--one inside the restricted zone, and two outer radial orbitals--PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 levels were found 41 (1), 110 (8) and 148 (16) microg/m3 inside the Ecopass area, 42 (3), 116 (14) and 152 (28) microg/m3 along the middle belt, and 39 (4), 102 (15) and 127 (23) microg/m3 along the greater Milan orbital ("Tangenziale"), respectively (ns). Mean (SD) PM10 levels from ARPA in the two months before the enforcement were 71.2 (32.6) and 74.8 (38.4) microg/m3, in the Ecopass zone and outside, respectively while after the enforcement were 67.3 (36.4) and 70.9 (38.3) microg/m3 of PM10, respectively (ns).
compared to regional averages, SMRs in the SIN were significantly higher for lung (25.3%) and stomach (54.1%) cancer in men and for ovarian cancer (82.6%) in women. SMRs were instead significantly lower for all causes of death (8.7%), respiratory (26.6%) and cardiovascular (13.7%) diseases, liver (51.3%) and pancreas (46.9%) cancer in men and for cardiovascular diseases (22.1%) in women. These results did not change after adjustment by socioeconomic status. Spatial distribution of risks was homogeneous among municipalities and no groups of high risk municipalities were identified. A significant increasing temporal trend was observed for ovarian cancer.
an increased risk of lung, pleura and bladder cancer was observed among male residents in the city of Taranto (respectively: SIR 1.24, p-value &lt; 0.01; SIR: 2.21, p-value &lt; 0.01; SIR 1.28, p-value &lt; 0.01). For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a significant value was observed in the city of Taranto for males (SIR 1.46, p-value &lt; 0.01), as well as in the neighbouring area of Pulsano for females (SIR 3.88, p-value &lt; 0.01). An unexpected increased risk of brain cancer was found in both sexe risk (especially among males) of lung, pleura and bladder cancer is likely related to the chemical pollutants and asbestos, due to the presence of many industries and shipyards in the city of Taranto.
"FOTO positive" phenotype, a proxy variable of the fair phenotype, was directly and significantly associated with the tendency to sunburn (OR 4.64; 95% CI 4.39-4.89), the presence of freckles on the face (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.55-1.77), of naevi on the left forearm (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.12-1.25), the number of grandparents born in northern areas (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.15-2.07, for four northern grandparents versus none), the residence in Latina Province (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.07-1.20) and the use of sunscreens (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.55-1.88). An inverse association was observed with the male sex (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.86-0.96), the increase of school-class level (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.61-0.72, for the highest versus the lowest school-class level) and the ability to tan (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.34-0.42).
1332 male cases and 875 female cases were reviewed. No statistically significant difference was found with mean age of diagnosis (men 66.5 years; women 67.2 years). A greater proportion of women had adenocarcinoma (p &lt; 0.0001), lower grade (p = 0.002), and lower SEER summary stage (p = 0.009). There was no difference in laterality of tumor, 30-day post surgery survival or surgical procedure between men and women. Regression analysis showed a higher hazard ratio was associated with a increasing stage, grade, and those &gt; or =65 years of age while lower hazard ratio was associated with adenocarcinoma.
Both cases have striking similarities in their presentation and disease progression. Both had the disease diagnosed in later years of life, had cold nodules for 4-5 years before histological diagnosis, and both had local recurrence following thyroidectomy and postoperative radioiodine ablation. Local recurrence was treated with external radiation in each patient and both of them had persistent elevation of serum thyroglobulin levels with negative diagnostic whole body I-131 scans. Later on pulmonary metastatic disease was documented in each patient. Family history was pertinent for benign nodular thyroid disease in multiple family members.
There was no significant difference between GP using lateral condensation and GuttaFlow using a single cone for bacteria (p=0.8989) or dye (p=0.7489). GP using lateral condensation performed better than GP using vertical condensation for bacteria (p=0.0003) and dye (p=0.0006). GuttaFlow using a single cone also performed better than GP using vertical condensation for bacteria (p=0.0003) and dye (p=0.0004).
FS values of all reinforced subgroups were significantly higher than the values of the unreinforced subgroups (p&lt;0.05). Among the 3 unreinforced subgroups the difference in FS was insignificant (p&gt;0.05). Within the reinforced group there was a significant difference between the control group, which had a higher median FS value than the two other subgroups (p&lt;0.05).
Overall, 47% of the women were African American, with a mean age of 50 years. Older women were twice as likely as younger women to have had mammography within the previous year and significantly more likely than women 10 years younger to exercise at least 3 times weekly. African American women were significantly less likely than white women to exercise at least 3 times weekly, eat more than 2 servings daily of fruit and vegetables, or report a BMI of less than &lt;25 kg/m2. Mammography rates were comparable by race except among lesser-educated African American women, who showed higher rates versus comparable white women.
Statistical data gathered over the past several years indicate that African American women have greater mortality than Caucasian women from CAD, hypertension, stroke, and CHF. The mortality rate from CAD is 69% higher in black women than in white women. Mortality for black females from hypertension is 352% higher than for white females. Age-adjusted stroke death rates are 54% higher in African American than in Caucasian women, and the age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 is 113.4 vs. 97.5 for black and white women, respectively. Incidence, prevalence, and morbidity figures for CAD, hypertension, stroke, and CHF are all higher for African American females than for Caucasian females.
Education was significantly associated with never having been screened for cervical cancer for Cambodians. Low income (&lt;$10000) was significantly associated with never having been screened for Cambodian and Chinese women. Not having health insurance was significantly correlated with not getting screened for all ethnic groups. Age and living in the United States less than 15 years were significantly correlated with never having been screened for Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese women. Marital status was significantly correlated with not getting screened for Korean and Chinese women. English fluency was significantly associated with screening for Cambodians, Koreans, and Chinese. Barriers associated with women who were never screened compared to those barriers for women who were screened and were compliant included lack of knowledge, psychosocial, no insurance, language, transportation, and lack of time, but these barriers were different among the 4 ethnic groups.
Omnibus MANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the study and control groups regarding 3 variables: (1) gestational hypertension, p &lt; .46; (2) mother's last weight before delivery, p &lt; .001; and (3) mother's 6-week postpartum weight, p &lt; .001. Patients gaining 15 pounds or more during their pregnancy showed statistically significant differences between the groups for 8 variables.
There were 2562 total deliveries within the study period and 112 perinatal deaths giving a perinatal mortality rate of 43.7 per 1000 live births. Cesarean section accounted for 216 of the deliveries (8.4%) with 24 perinatal deaths (11.1%). Perinatal mortality from Cesarean sections accounted for 21.4% of the total deaths with severe birth asphyxia responsible for most perinatal deaths, 17 of 24 (70.8%). There were 174 emergency sections with 22 perinatal deaths, while 42 elective sections had 2 perinatal deaths. The main indications for cesarean section were cephalopelvic disproportion, 86 (39.8%); previous section plus an obstetric abnormality, 39 (18.1%); and prolonged obstructed labor, (10.2%), with perinatal deaths of 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
A total of 1808 cases of stillbirth were registered. The rate of stillbirth among white mothers was 3.7 per 1000, while the rate among blacks was 7.1 per 1000. Underweight black mothers had comparable risk for total (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2), early (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.5), and late stillbirth (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2) as compared to their normal-weight counterparts. By contrast, underweight white gravidas had a 30% reduced likelihood (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) for late stillbirth as compared to normal-weight white mothers. However, the risks for total and early stillbirth among underweight white mothers were similar to those of normal-weight white mothers.
Of 160 respondents, 14% of women regularly took calcium supplements, 16% were former users, and 70% never used calcium supplements. Characteristics associated with calcium use status included age, multivitamin use, and marital status. Few African American women recall discussions with their doctors about calcium intake. Most who formerly took calcium supplements and most who had never taken them were willing to do so if recommended by their physician.
Fifty-five patients with of genital tract fistula were managed in the period under review, constituting 1.17% of total gynecological admissions. Obstetric fistula accounted for 51 (93%) of genital fistula, and 92.7% of cases were caused by prolonged obstructed labor. The most common form of fistula was the midvaginal type, and 89% of affected women were married with primiparous women mostly affected (43.6%). Menstrual function was lost in 51% of the patients, while obstetric palsy complicated 18.2% of the cases. Half of the women (51%) were abandoned by their spouses, and surgical repair was successful in only 32% of the cases.
Most participants were female (n=20), and the mean age was 49 years. All participants were at least high school graduates. Four major levels of influence emerged from data analysis: (1) the health care system, (2) the community, (3) the family, and (4) the individual. The most prevalent concerns about hypertension centered on sodium, diet, neighborhoods, mistrust, and denial. Of great concern was lack of provider trust and a fatalistic, hopeless mindset. To improve trust, our participants suggested developing a hypertension education program and providing patients with culturally specific materials.
On a 5-point Likert scale, comfort levels increased from a median of 1 to 3. All interns reported feeling more comfortable with chest tube placement and all reported having better understanding of the process of chest tube placement following the procedure lab.
Results indicated significant improvements in vowel and consonant recognition with LFT for the 30 dB HL input level. Significant improvement in the accuracy of production of high-frequency (HF) fricatives after six weeks of use of LFT was also observed.
Repeat otoacoustic emissions testing with another device of the same model revealed essentially absent distortion product otoacoustic emissions and transient otoacoustic emissions. Calibration of both otoacoustic emissions devices using a 1 cc membranous cavity indicated present intermodulation distortion for the device that yielded robust distortion product otoacoustic emissions for the patient but absent intermodulation distortion for the device that revealed absent distortion product otoacoustic emissions and absent transient evoked otoacoustic emissions for the patient. The calibration findings for the device yielding intermodulation distortion in the cavity were confirmed by an engineer of a technical instrumentation company. The device was shipped back to the manufacturer of the device for repair. The manufacturer's engineers diagnosed the problem as an interruption in the relay system. Following repair, calibration revealed the absence of intermodulation distortion in the 1 cc membranous cavity.
Receiving operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and area under the curve (AUC) indicated no significant benefit to performance from the head shaking variation compared to the standard FST in identifying labyrinthine weakness as classified by caloric unilateral weakness results.
Data from the validated questionnaires showed relatively low levels of tinnitus distress, moderate levels of hearing problems, and low scores on the anxiety and depression scales. Using the criteria proposed for the THI (which was completed by 107 patients), 35% (N = 38) had a score indicating "no handicap," 30% (N = 32) "mild handicap" 18% (N = 19) "moderate handicap", and 17% (N = 18) "severe handicap." Thus 37 individuals from the total series of 151 reported moderate to severe tinnitus handicap (24.5%). Tinnitus distress was associated with increased hearing problems, anxiety, and depression.
The results showed that prefitting hearing aid counseling had small but significant effects on expectations. The two forms of counseling did not differ in their effectiveness at changing expectations; however, anecdotally, we learned from many participants that that they enjoyed listening to the auditory demonstrations and that they found them to be an interesting listening exercise. The data also show that positive expectations result in more positive outcome and that hearing aid fine-tuning is beneficial to the user.
A total of 261 cervical swabs collected from women with histologically confirmed CIN 3 lesions were analyzed using four genotyping methods: the Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV Assay, the Innogenetics INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Test, and the in-house PGMY09/11, and CPI/CPIIg polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Of 261 samples, 253 (96.9%) were HPV positive. The most common HPV genotype in CIN 3 lesions in the Slovenian samples was HPV-16 (59.0%), followed by HPV-31 (7.5%), HPV-33 (7.1%), HPV-58 (5.0%), and HPV-51 (4.0%). The presence of more than one HPV genotype was detected in 49/253 (19.4%) samples. Together, HPV-16 and HPV- 18 accounted for 67.4% of CIN 3 lesions in this Slovenian population.
The mean time of follow-up of the patients between their treatment for breast cancer and the start of this study was 12.3 months, and three complications (4.5%) occurred; two cases of lymphangitis were reported after insect bites and one case of erysipelas after a hand injury, with repeat episodes reported by all three patients.
Of the 93 programs and schools reviewed, 14% required a course in ethics and 16% required a course in law. The majority (range = 55%-76%) of the survey respondents indicated being "prepared" or "very prepared" for each of the 9 public health scenarios. There were no significant relationships between scenario responses and completion of an ethics course. Responses to 2 scenarios (one involving food code violations and one involving a prison population) were significantly related to participants' completion of a course in law.
We observed statistically significant reductions in the numbers and rates of deaths caused by alcohol-related disease beginning immediately after the 1983 and 2002 alcohol tax increases in Alaska. In terms of effect size, the reductions were -29% (Cohen's d = -0.57) and -11% (Cohen's d = -0.52) for the 2 tax increases. Statistical tests of temporary-effect models versus long-term-effect models showed little dissipation of the effect over time.
The overall rate of cigarette use declined between 1964 and 2002. Nicotine dependence does not appear to have declined overall, and there is evidence that nicotine dependence has increased among women in recent cohorts. The odds of nicotine dependence among cigarette users appear to have increased significantly in recent cohorts.
Other than having a greater prevalence of substance dependence (14% vs 6%), there were no significant differences between hard- and easy-to-reach respondents. However, excluding the hard to reach would have decreased response rates from 89% to 71% and nullified the findings, a result that did not stem primarily from reduced statistical power.
We found 291 children had culture-confirmed TB. Resistance to isoniazid or rifampin increased from 21 of 306 (6.9%) to 41 of 319 (12.9%) and 43 of 285 (15.1%) in the first to third surveys (P = .005) and multidrug resistance from 7 of 306 (2.3%) to 18 of 319 (5.6%) and 19 of 285 (6.7%; P = .033). Although previously treated children had significantly more drug resistance than did new TB cases (19 of 66 [28.8%] vs 24 of 225 [10.7%]; odds ratio = 3.39; 95% confidence interval = 1.62, 7.05), evidence suggests transmission rather than acquisition of resistance. HIV infection was not significantly associated with drug resistance.
The medical unit functioned at a relatively high level, primarily as a result of the flexibility, creativity, and dedication of its staff and the presence of strong leadership. Chronic health care services and prescription refills were the most commonly mentioned services provided, and collaboration with a national pharmacy proved instrumental in reconstructing medication histories. The lack of a comprehensive and well-communicated emergency response plan resulted in several preventable inefficiencies.
States differed notably with respect to political-economic characteristics and occupational fatality rates, although these characteristics were more homogeneous within rather than between regions. Industry and workforce composition contributed significantly to differences in state injury rates, but political-economic characteristics of states were also significantly associated with injury rates, after adjustment accounting for those factors.
We found a general institutional commitment to community review as well as personal commitment from some participants in the process. However, difficulty in communicating across divides of knowledge and privilege created serious gaps in implementation, leaving research vulnerable to validity threats (such as misinterpretation of findings) and communities vulnerable to harm. The methods used in each collaboration solved some, but not all, of the problems that hindered communication.
The PPP led to improvements in educational attainment, health insurance, income, and family environment Improvements in these domains, in turn, lead to improvements in an array of behavioral risk factors and health (P = .01). However, despite these reductions in behavioral risk factors, participants did not exhibit any overall improvement in physical health outcomes by the age of 40 years.
Seven percent of parents reported that they and their child had experienced homelessness (i.e., staying in shelters, cars, or on the street). Black children and children in the poorest families had the highest prevalence of homelessness (11%). In adjusted analyses, most general health measures were similar for children who had and had not been homeless. Children who had ever experienced homelessness were more likely to have an emotional, behavioral, or developmental problem (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 2.6; P = .01), to have received mental health care (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.6, 3.2; P &lt; .001), and to have witnessed serious violence with a knife (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1, 2.3; P = .007) than were children who were never homeless.
PPAH and RSP concentrations in casinos were, on average, 4 and 6 times, respectively, that of outdoor levels despite generous ventilation and low smoking prevalence. SHS infiltrated into nonsmoking gaming areas. Patrons' urine cotinine increased 1.9 ng/mL on average after about 4-hour visits.
Two-level random-effects count models (with students nested within schools) indicated that student-reported substance use (rate ratio [RR] = 0.41; 90% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25, 0.66) and violence (RR = 0.42; 90% CI = 0.24, 0.73) were significantly lower for students attending intervention schools. A 2-level random-effects binary model indicated that sexual activity was lower (odds ratio = 0.24; 90% CI = 0.08, 0.66) for intervention students. Teacher reports substantiated the effects seen for student-reported data. Dose-response analyses indicated that students exposed to the program for at least 3 years had significantly lower rates of all negative behaviors.
Findings revealed 4 latent housing classifications. Most participants (57%) had experienced stable housing situations since their exit from foster care. Those in the remaining 3 categories endured housing problems, and 20% were chronically homeless during the follow-up period. Housing instability was related to emotional and behavioral problems, physical and sexual victimization, criminal conviction, and high school dropout.
Among workers who were free of depression in 1996, 13% had depression in 1999. Compared with workers with no sickness absence during the study period, those with sickness absence were more likely to be depressed at follow-up (for 1 period of sickness absence, fully adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, 1.82; for 2 or more periods, fully adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.61, 2.36). Future depression was predicted both by psychiatric and nonpsychiatric sickness absence (fully adjusted OR = 3.79 [95% CI = 2.81, 5.10] and 1.41 [95% CI = 1.21, 1.65], respectively).
Of the 1056 participants, 103 (9.8%) reported a history of TB, among whom 93% received anti-TB medication and 80% were diagnosed in the United States. Treatment was prematurely halted among 8% of patients; deportation from the United States was the cause of half of these treatment interruptions. History of travel to (odds ratio [OR] = 6.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53, 27.20) or deportation from (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.07, 3.12) the United States and incarceration (OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.06, 4.58) were independently associated with a reported lifetime diagnosis of TB.
Over the previous year, 71% of men and 21% of women in the sample reported jail stays. Among women, long-term single-room occupancy hotel stays ( &gt; 90 days) were protective for incarceration. Stays in the street were associated with incarceration among both genders, but among men, short-term (i.e., &lt;or= 90 days) street stays were associated with the highest odds of incarceration, and among women, long-term street stays were most correlated with incarceration. Sex trade increased the odds of incarceration among men only; recent drug use was associated with incarceration among both genders.
Respondents reported being subjected to racial epithets associated with sexual victimization significantly more often during combined attacks by Sudanese government forces and Janjaweed militia forces than during separate attacks by either force.
There was an 89% adjusted increase in work injury risk among workers with self-reported dyslexia (a type of learning disability) relative to workers reporting no learning disabilities, although this result did not meet traditional statistical significance criteria. Being out of school, either with or without a high school diploma, was associated with a significantly increased risk of work injury, even after control for a number of demographic and work-related variables.
After adjustment, a workweek of 32 hours or more (mean birthweight decrease of 43 g) and high job strain (mean birthweight decrease of 72 g) were significantly associated with birthweight. Only high job strain increased the risk of delivering an SGA infant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 2.2). After adjustment, the combination of high job strain and a long workweek resulted in the largest birthweight reduction (150 g) and the highest risk of delivering an SGA infant (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2, 3.2).
Of the transit types evaluated, subway cars and platforms had the highest associated equivalent continuous average (L(eq)) and maximum noise levels. All transit types had L(eq) levels appreciably above 70 A-weighted decibels, the threshold at which noise-induced hearing loss is considered possible.
The results show that febrile temperature is capable of markedly inhibiting the growth of field isolate P. falciparum but not to K1 and 3D7 standard strains. K1 and 3D7 grown under heat shock developed greater and the reinfection rate was increased up to 2-folds when compared to that of non-heat shock group. The IC50 value of K1 toward chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine under heat shock was higher than that of K1 under non-heat shock which is opposite to that of 3D7. Heat shock caused death in field isolated parasite. It was also found that the febrile temperature coped with chloroquine uptake had no effect to the development, drug sensitivity and the parasite number of K1 strain. In the opposite way, heat shock and chloroquine shows extremely effect toward 3D7 and field isolate PF91 as shown by higher number of dead parasites compared to that of control group. After culture under high temperature with artesunate, the total parasite number of all strains including K1, 3D7 and PF91 was extremely decreased and the parasite was not found at the end. Additionally, the expression of pfHsp70s was found in all strains and conditions as shown in 120 kDa hybridized band. However, the proteome extracted from K1 grown under heat shock with chloroquine, anti-pfHsp70 interacted with additional three bands identified by MALDI-TOF as elongation factor-1alpha (83 kDa), pfHsp86 (60 kDa) and phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (43 kDa).
A known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. The isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against S. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against S. aureus and S. mutans (MIC 15.6 microg/ml) while, S. faecalis, S. pyogenis and L. acidophilus ranked next (MIC 31.2 microg/ml). Furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast C. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; MIC: 125.0).
Phenotypic characterization identified a high ESBL rate of 55% of K pneumoniae isolates. ESBL producing K pneumoniae were PCR positive for SHV, TEM and CTX-M beta-lactamase genes with prevalences 97.3%, 84.1% and 34.1%, respectively. Within the CTX-M family, two groups of enzymes, CTX-M-1 and CTXM- 9-like genes were found with prevalences of 60% and 40%, respectively.
Three co-expression networks, configured from one patient-specific, one tissue-specific and a stem cell-based miRNA expression data, are studied for analyzing the proposed methodology. A novel compactness measure is introduced. The results establish the statistical significance of the sets of miRNAs evolved and the efficacy of the self-pruning phase employed by the proposed method. All these datasets yield similar network patterns and produce coherent groups of miRNAs. The existence of common TFs, regulating these groups of miRNAs, is empirically tested. The results found are very promising. A novel visual validation method is also proposed that reflects the homogeneity as well as statistical properties of the grouped miRNAs. This visual validation method provides a promising and statistically significant graphical tool for expression analysis.
Through simulation studies, we show that our method outperforms other simple methods based on inferring the underlying CNV and assessing association using regular tests that do not propagate call uncertainty. We apply the method to a real data set in a controlled MLPA experiment showing good results. The methodology is also extended to illustrate how to analyze aCGH data.
PolyMin, a computer program combining the detection of a minimum set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or insertions/deletions (INDELs) necessary for allele differentiation with the subsequent genotype differentiation in plant populations has been developed. Its efficiency in finding minimum sets of polymorphisms is comparable to other available program packages.
We identified 59 mutations in 57 genes that affect aggressive behavior, none of which had been previously implicated to affect aggression. Thirty-two of these mutants exhibited increased aggression, while 27 lines were less aggressive than the control. Many of the genes affect the development and function of the nervous system, and are thus plausibly relevant to the execution of complex behaviors. Others affect basic cellular and metabolic processes, or are mutations in computationally predicted genes for which aggressive behavior is the first biological annotation. Most of the mutations had pleiotropic effects on other complex traits. We characterized nine of these mutations in greater detail by assessing transcript levels throughout development, morphological changes in the mushroom bodies, and restoration of control levels of aggression in revertant alleles. All of the P-element insertions affected the tagged genes, and had pleiotropic effects on brain morphology.
We generated more that 3.6 million sequence reads of average length 250 bp for the MAQC A and B samples and introduced a data analysis pipeline for translating cDNA read counts into gene expression levels. Using BLAST, 90% of the reads mapped to the human genome and 64% of the reads mapped to the RefSeq database of well annotated genes with e-values &lt;/= 10-20. We measured gene expression levels in the A and B samples by counting the numbers of reads that mapped to individual RefSeq genes in multiple sequencing runs to evaluate the MAQC quality metrics for reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy and compared the results with DNA microarrays and Quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR) from the MAQC studies. In addition, 88% of the reads were successfully aligned directly to the human genome using the AceView alignment programs with an average 90% sequence similarity to identify 137,899 unique exon junctions, including 22,193 new exon junctions not yet contained in the RefSeq database.
None of the 148 contact-children received prophylaxis, one had cervical tuberculosis; the risk for LTBI was 31.0%. Awareness of the infectiousness of tuberculosis was low among patients (31%) and their contacts (31%), and risky behavior was common. After multivariate logistic analysis, increased LTBI was found in children with contact with sputum positive adults (OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.4-7.7), patients highly positive sputum prior to treatment (AFB &gt;2+; OR: 4.7, 95% CI: 1.7-12.3), and living in ethnic minorities (OR: 5.4, 95% CI: 2.2-13.6).
Our results confirm that Toxin A and Toxin B production in NAP1-related strains and ATCC 43255 occurs earlier in the exponential growth phase compared to most NAP1-nonrelated clinical isolates. Despite the hyper-production observed in ATCC 43255 it had no mutations in tcdC, tcdR or tcdE. Analysis of the other clinical isolates indicated that the kinetics and ultimate final concentration of Toxin A and B did not correlate with the presence or lack of alterations in tcdC, tcdR or tcdE.
There were 4983 attempts at the MCQ part of the examination by 3303 graduates from the 19 United Kingdom medical schools. Using the standardised overall mark minus the pass mark graduates from five medical schools performed significantly better than the mean for the group and five schools performed significantly worse than the mean for the group. Males performed significantly better than females in all aspects of the MCQ - physiology, mean difference = 3.0% (95% CI 2.3, 3.7), p &lt; 0.001; pharmacology, mean difference = 1.7% (95% CI 1.0, 2.3), p &lt; 0.001; physics with clinical measurement, mean difference = 3.5% (95% CI 2.8, 4.1), p &lt; 0.001; overall mark, mean difference = 2.7% (95% CI 2.1, 3.3), p &lt; 0.001; and standardised overall mark minus the pass mark, mean difference = 2.5% (95% CI 1.9, 3.1), p &lt; 0.001. Graduates from three medical schools that have undergone the change from Traditional to Problem Based Learning curricula did not show any change in performance in any aspects of the MCQ pre and post curriculum change.
From our biomedical research data, the slope beta governing the dependence of h-index on the number of publications in biomedical research was found to be similar to that estimated in other disciplines ( approximately 0.4). The MII was positively associated with the average number of citations/publication (r = 0.653, p &lt; 0.001), the h-index (r = 0.213, p = 0.002), the number of publications with &gt; or = 100 citations (r = 0.211, p = 0.004) but not with the number of publications (r = -0.020, p = 0.765). It was the most highly associated indicator with the share of country-specific government budget appropriations or outlays for research and development as % of GDP in 2004 (r = 0.229) followed by the average number of citations/publication (r = 0.153) whereas the corresponding correlation coefficient for the h-index was close to 0 (r = 0.029). MII was calculated for first 10 top-ranked European universities in life sciences and biomedicine, as provided by Times Higher Education ranking system, and their total and field-specific performance was compared.
The pontine infarction with PMH or hemiplegia accounted for 10.2% (12/118) of all first-ever ischemic stroke patients and 24% (12/50) of the patients with both PMH or hemiplegia and acute negative CT scans. Compared to the patients with cerebral infarction, the patients with pontine infarction had more frequency of diabetes mellitus (50.0% vs 5.3%, P = 0.001), nonvertiginous dizziness at onset (58.3% vs 21.1%, P = 0.036) and a progressive course (33.3% vs 2.6%, P = 0.011).
Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), SOD2, and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) immunoreactivity increased in cells of the cerebellar cortex of CO-exposed pups. INOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity also increased in blood vessels and Purkinje cells (PCs) of pups from group-A, B and C. By contrast, nNOS immunoreactivity decreased in PCs from group-B. Endothelial NOS immunoreactivity showed no changes in any CO-exposed group. The mRNA levels for iNOS were significantly up-regulated in the cerebellum of rats from group B; however, mRNA levels for nNOS and eNOS remained relatively unchanged in groups A, B and C. Ferritin-H immunoreactivity increased in group-B. Immunocytochemistry for neurofilaments (structural protein), synapsin-1 (functional protein), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA), were decreased in groups A and B. Immunoreactivity for two calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin and calbindin, remained unchanged. The immunoreactivity of the astrocytic marker GFAP increased after prenatal exposure.
Between 2004 and 2008, the proportion of referrals occurring within four months of onset of end stage renal disease dropped from 37 of 116 (32%) to 10 of 84 (12%), P=0.001. The proportion of patients starting haemodialysis with a mature arteriovenous fistula increased from 19 of 108 (18%) to 27 of 76 (36%), P=0.006. The proportion of patients who started haemodialysis as outpatients increased from 39 of 113 (35%) to 47 of 84 (56%), P=0.003.
As compared to their sibling controls, dyslexic children exhibited significantly reduced N100 amplitudes induced by both reverse and forward digit span at Fp1, F3, Fp2, Fz, C4, Cz and F4 and at Fp1, F3, C5, C3, Fz, F4, C6, P4 and Fp2 leads respectively. Memory performance of the dyslexics group was not significantly lower than that of the controls. However, enhanced memory performance in the control group is associated with increased N100 amplitude induced by high frequency stimuli at the C5, C3, C6 and P4 leads and increased N100 amplitude induced by low frequency stimuli at the P4 lead.
The questionnaire was completed by 1,023 patients (71.5% women, mean age 44.4 years, mean disease duration 20.3 years) with vitiligo. The mean DLQI was 7.0 (7.5 in women, 5.5 in men) compared with 8.6 in psoriasis. Of the patients with vitiligo, 24.6% had a DLQI &gt; 10 which indicates severe QoL reductions, compared with 34.1% in patients with psoriasis. The highest mean DLQI value was observed in the patient group aged 20-29 years. EQ-5D mean score was 83.6 compared with 75.3 in psoriasis. Of the patients with vitiligo, 32.9% would pay more than 5,000 Euro in order to achieve complete disease remission. WTP was highest among middle-aged patients (30-60 years). There was a significant correlation between DLQI scores and WTP (chi(2) = 65.43, P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, WTP significantly correlated with duration of disease, and with body surface area affected (P &lt; 0.001).
Thirteen patients were enrolled and 12 completed the study; 155 ECP treatments were initiated and 153 completed. There were no ADEs or UADEs reported during the study. The mean treatment time was shorter for patients who received dual- compared with single-needle treatments (74.4 vs. 103.0 min, P &lt; 0.0001) and the extracorporeal volume was lower (216 vs. 266 mL).
Forty-eight patients with a mean age of 43.9 years were included in the study. Vitiligo caused overall a moderate effect on patients' QoL with a 7.17 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) mean score (out of 30) without correlation with gender. According to distribution, no or minimal (DLQI 0-1), mild (2-5), moderate (6-11) and severe (12-20) impairment of QoL was found in five (10%), 14 (29%), 18 (38%) and 11 (23%) patients, respectively. The mean perceived severity evaluated by the patients was 4.91 based on visual analogue scale from 0 to 10. The self-body image was influenced by gender, perceived severity and disease characteristics. Perceived severity and patient personality were predictors of QoL impairment. Perceived severity of vitiligo was explained mainly by the patients' personality and less significantly by objective criteria.
Borrelia afzelii was identified in three cases, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in one case each. Culture was positive in only one case (B. garinii).
At the 12-month follow-up, seven of the 12 patients remained clear, with four of the nonresponders demonstrating peripheral margin failure. Patients were scored for pain during and immediately after treatment using the numerical rating scale (NRS; 1-10). All 12 subjects scored pain as &lt; 2 using the NRS (median score 1). In contrast, a similar cohort of 50 consecutive patients from our routine PDT clinic (Aktilite inorganic LED source; 75 J cm(-2), irradiance 80 mW cm(-2)) scored a median of 6 on the NRS.
Patients with AE and patients with other eczema had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher levels of LL-37 in lesional skin than in nonlesional skin. The expression of LL-37 was not statistically associated to severity of AE valued by SCORAD. Nonlesional skin from patients did not differ from skin of healthy subjects in terms of LL-37 expression. In the presence of epidermal injury or vesicles the LL-37 peptide was always detected.
Our experiments and data analyses demonstrated apparent differences between hypertrophic scar tissue and normal skin in terms of their morphological structure and the spectral characteristics of collagen and elastin fibres. These differences can potentially be used to distinguish hypertrophic scar tissues from normal skin and to evaluate treatment responses.
Specific RNase 7 IR was present throughout the entire HF outer root sheath in situ and in cell culture, whereas psoriasin IR was present only in the most distal compartment and not detectable in cultured ORS cells. Upon treatment with Gram-positive (LTA, protein A) or Gram-negative bacterial (LPS, flagellin) cell wall components, or with the cytokine IFN-gamma, the IR of both psoriasin and RNase 7 was modified. TLR4 and TLR5 IR was detected in the normal HF epithelium and were upregulated after treatment with their respective ligand. The mRNA analysis confirmed the immunohistochemistry results.
TRAF1 was expressed in roughly 70-80% and MUM1 was expressed in 70-100% of all the groups of cutaneous CD30-positive lymphoproliferations. Highest levels of BCL2 were expressed in MF-TR (73%), in contrast to 21% in C-ALCL and 36% in LyP. Highest levels of CD15 were expressed in C-ALCL (43%), compared with 18% in LyP and 9% in MF-TR. A relationship with survival was not clear.
The genotype and allele frequencies of MBL2 structural and promoter polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the control and patient population (P-values: P &lt; 0.019 for codon 52, P &lt; 0.373 for codon 54, P &lt; 0.855 for codon 57 and P &lt; 0.889 for -221 promoter polymorphisms) after Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing, which suggests that there is no association of MBL2 structural and promoter polymorphisms with generalized vitiligo.
The kappa statistic highlighted substantial degrees of agreement between dermatologists for the glabellar frown lines scale, and the log-linear method did not evidence any scale defect. For the three other scales, only fair to moderate degrees of agreement were observed between dermatologists. In addition, difficulties in distinguishing between some adjacent categories were evidenced.
In IC patients, betaPV was detected in 30 of 59 (51%) tumours and two of 11 (18%) normal skin samples (P = 0.046). In IS patients, betaPV was found in 27 of 62 (44%) tumours; no normal skin samples were available for comparison. The most frequently found genotypes were HPV-24, HPV-15 and HPV-38. Of those tumours infected with betaPV, 28 of 57 (49%) were infected with more than one genotype (range 2-8). Tumours from IS patients were from a younger age group (mean age 57.4 years) than IC patients (mean age 73.8 years). Multiple infections were more common in tumours from IC patients (21 of 30; 70%) compared with those from IS patients (seven of 27; 26%) (P &lt; 0.001). In the IC group, age did not appear to influence the distribution of single and multiple infections whereas in IS patients the proportion of multiple infections to single infections increased with age. There were no multiple infections in normal skin.
Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) levels after D-Squame stripping were elevated in L compared with NL and H skin at all sampling points (P &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the amount of SC removed by sequential tape stripping was decreased in L skin, indicating increased intracorneocyte cohesion (P &lt; 0.05). By correlating 1/TEWL values and SC removed as an estimate of SC thickness, a significantly thinner SC was observed in L compared with NL and H skin (P &lt; 0.05). Elevated extractable serine protease activity was measured in AD skin in the order: SC tryptase-like enzyme (45x), plasmin (30x), urokinase (7.1x), trypsin-like kallikreins (5.8x) and chymotrypsin-like kallikreins (3.9x). Leucocyte elastase activity was not detected in H and NL skin but was observed in AD SC samples (L skin). All enzymes were elevated in the deeper layers of L SC compared with NL and H SC samples. All consistently elevated SC protease activities were significantly correlated with the bioinstrumental data.
Four patients who met study criteria were identified: three girls and one boy. Mean age at diagnosis was 16.6 years (range 16-17). Three patients had cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (CMZL), and one had a spindle-cell (sarcomatoid) lymphoma, most probably follicular centre cell type. All were treated with the standard regimen used in adults. The mean duration of follow up was 45 months. No extracutaneous progression was noted. At present two of the four patients are in complete clinical remission.
In total, 207 patients received the two-compound scalp formulation and 105 patients received calcipotriol scalp solution. The proportion of patients with 'clear' or 'minimal' disease at week 8 was significantly greater in the two-compound scalp formulation group (68.6%) than in the calcipotriol scalp solution group (31.4%; P &lt; 0.001). Improvement was more rapid with the two-compound scalp formulation than with calcipotriol scalp solution. Further evidence of the superiority of the two-compound scalp formulation over the scalp solution was demonstrated through greater improvements in clinical signs and fewer adverse events.
In our series, nine of 106 patients with malignant lymphomas had ichthyosiform eruptions during their clinical courses, including three (30%) of 10 patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and six (14%) of 44 patients with mycosis fungoides (MF). None of the 18 patients with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma had ichthyosiform eruptions. The three patients with ALCL had ichthyosiform eruptions histopathologically consistent with acquired ichthyosis (AI) in which packed horny layers and thin granular layers were present without lymphocytic infiltration. In contrast, four of the six patients with MF (stages Ib and IIb) had ichthyosiform eruptions with epidermotropic infiltration of atypical lymphocytes, as observed in ichthyosiform MF (IMF). Of the remaining two patients, one showed histopathological features overlapping AI and IMF, and the other had AI alone. These two patients (stages IVa and IIb) had tumours composed of CD30+ cells. Filaggrin expression was markedly diminished in both AI and IMF-like eruptions, similar to that of inherited ichthyosis vulgaris.
A total of 138 responses were received (51%). Seventeen SpRs had not experienced any of the assessments; 92 had undergone MSF, 95 DOPS and 54 mini-CEX. The total experience of the respondents amounted to a minimum of 251 DOPS, 122 MSF and 142 mini-CEX. Trainees appreciated the formative aspects of the assessments, especially feedback and training opportunities, although not all trainees reported receiving useful feedback. MSF was praised for the insights that it provides. All of the assessments were found to be time-consuming and difficult to organize. DOPS and mini-CEX carried a degree of stress and artificiality. Concerns were raised over the possibility of victimization by MSF raters. Discussion of performance in the assessments was rarely prominent in trainees' annual summative reviews.
Eleven patients reacted positively in all three patch tests, two patients reacted in one or two tests and two remained negative. All 13 positive patients displayed variability over time, in terms of the lowest dose of nickel to which they responded. Also the cytokine response to nickel varied over time but the patients' mean cytokine response was positively correlated with their mean patch test reactivity (r(s) = 0.70, P &lt; 0.01 for IL-4; r(s) = 0.78, P &lt; 0.001 for IL-13). However, although the changes over time in patch test reactivity and the cytokine responses to nickel displayed a similar pattern in many patients, there was no significant correlation between the individuals' variation over time in vivo and in vitro.
We identified 26 (45.6%) male and 31 (54.4%) female patients with MCC; the age at diagnosis ranged from 26 to 97 years (median 71 years). Primary tumours were located mainly on the head and neck areas (27 cases, 47.4%) and upper extremities (14 cases, 24.6%); 11 tumours were found on the lower extremities (19.3%) and four lesions on the chest (7%); one patient had an unknown primary location. Forty-five (78.9%) patients were diagnosed at stage I of the disease, 11 (19.3%) at stage II, and one patient (1.8%) at stage III at initial presentation. Stage of the disease and age at initial presentation were statistically significant with regard to overall (P &lt; 0.0001; P = 0.0327) and tumour-specific survival (P &lt; 0.0001; P = 0.0156). Use of the Cox regression model revealed initial stage of the disease as the only significant factor in the multivariate analysis. Radiotherapy applied promptly after excision of the primary tumour extended the time to progression significantly (P = 0.0376) but did not prolong overall or tumour-specific survival. Other parameters such as sex, site of tumour, sentinel node biopsy, excision margins, skin and noncutaneous malignancies were found to be not significant.
Thirty-three per cent of primary schoolchildren had warts (participation rate 96%). Nine per cent had hand warts, 20% had plantar warts and 4% had both hand and plantar warts. Parental questionnaires (response rate 76%) showed that environmental factors connected to barefoot activities, public showers or swimming pool visits were not related to the presence of warts. An increased risk of the presence of warts was found in children with a family member with warts [odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.6] and in children where there was a high prevalence of warts in the school class (OR per 10% increase in wart prevalence in school class 1.6, 95% CI 1.5-1.8).
The prevalence of FM I and MP sensitization followed an inverted V-pattern among women aged 18-41 years (i.e. an increase from 1990 to 1998, followed by a decrease from 1998 to 2006). Logistic regression analyses showed that 'medical consultation due to cosmetic dermatitis' (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.83-6.20) and 'cosmetic dermatitis within the past 12 months' (OR 3.53, CI 2.02-6.17) were significantly associated with sensitization to FM I.
One thousand, one hundred and eleven new skin tumour specimens were identified. General practitioners (GPs) were least accurate in clinical diagnosis, with 42.8% (59/138) of their request forms including the eventual histological diagnosis, compared with 69.5% (328/472) for dermatologists (odds ratio, OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.22-0.48). Inappropriate procedures were most often performed by plastic surgeons, usually involving large excision biopsies for benign lesions in elderly patients [6.6% (20/305) of their specimens vs. 0% for dermatologists, exact P &lt; 0.001]. Excision biopsies performed by GPs had the highest rate of margin involvement by tumour of any specialty [68% (15/22) of such specimens vs. 8% (9/116) for dermatologists; OR 25.47, 95% CI 8.26-78.53]. As per National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance, 13.8% (19/138) of tumours operated on by GPs should instead have been referred to secondary care for initial surgical management.
Ibuprofen at 10(-3) mol L(-1) significantly reduced TNF-alpha-stimulated migration of both cell types to that of nonstimulated cells (P &lt; 0.001). TNF-alpha-unstimulated cell migration was not significantly affected. Cells responded similarly to SS and SR forms of ibuprofen. Cells treated with ibuprofen sodium salt-loaded hydrogels showed a significant reduction in migration when compared with unloaded hydrogels. Ibuprofen induced apoptosis in HBL cells but had no effect on C8161 melanoma cells apoptosis at concentrations that reduced migration.
Of the 63 cancer centers, 44 use a matrix structure, 16 have a freestanding structure, and three have a Department of Oncology structure. Kruskal-Wallis tests reveal no statistically significant differences in the amount of funding per faculty member or the number of HHMI investigators between centers with a matrix, freestanding or Department of Oncology structure.
The immunization using autologous DCs electrotransfected with allogeneic osteosarcoma total RNA induced UMR106-specific CTL responses which were statistically significant and the cytotoxic activity was inhibited by the treatment with anti-CD8 and anti-MHC-class I monoclonal antibodies. In in vivo experiments, 80% of the rats immunized with allogeneic osteosarcoma RNA transfected to DCs were typically able to reject tumor challenge and remained tumor-free. Vaccinated survivors developed long immunological memory and were able to reject a subsequent rechallenge with the same tumor cells but not a syngeneic unrelated tumor line.
Sixty-four children (34 with influenza A subtype H3N2, 11 with influenza A subtype H1N1, and 19 with influenza B virus) aged 1-12 years (median age, 3 years, 1 month) were enrolled. By days 4-7 after initiation of treatment, of 64 samples tested, 47 (73.4%) and 26 (40.6%) had virus detectable by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and culture, respectively. By days 8-12 after initiation of treatment, of 53 samples tested, 18 (33.9%) and 1 (1.8%) had virus detectable by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and culture, respectively. We found no statistically significant differences in the reduction of viral shedding or time to clearance of virus between viral subtypes. Antiviral-resistant viruses were recovered from 3 (27.3%) of 11 children with influenza A subtype H1N1, 1 (2.9%) of 34 children with influenza A subtype H3N2, and 0 (0%) of 19 children with influenza B virus, all of whom were treated with oseltamivir (P = .004). There was no evidence of prolonged illness in children infected with drug-resistant virus.
Mean (+/-SD) baseline levels of hCAP18 in case patients and control patients were 539 +/- 278 ng/mL and 650 +/- 343 ng/mL, respectively (P = .006). hCAP18 levels had a modest correlation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels r = 0.23; P = .053) but not with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels r = -0.06; P = .44). Patients with hCAP18 levels in the lowest tertile had a 2-fold increased risk (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.5) of death attributable to infection; after multivariable adjustment, this relationship remained statistically significant (odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-11.2).
One patient fulfilled an exclusion criterion and was removed from the study. Twenty-seven patients received vancomycin, and 23 received nitazoxanide; 23 and 18 patients, respectively, completed the full course of treatment. Initial responses occurred in 20 (74%) of 27 patients treated with vancomycin and in 17 (77%) of 22 patients treated with nitazoxanide (95% confidence interval, -24% to +28%). In those who completed therapy, response rates were 87% (20 of 23 patients) in the vancomycin group and 94% (17 of 18 patients) in the nitazoxanide group (95% confidence interval, -18% to +30%). Times to complete resolution of symptoms were similar in the 2 groups (P = .55). Two patients in the vancomycin group and 1 patient in the nitazoxanide group experienced relapse within 31 days after beginning treatment. Sustained response rates were 78% (18 of 23 patients) for the vancomycin group, and 89% (16 of 18 patients) for the nitazoxanide group (95% confidence interval, -18% to +35%).
For the 14 studies that met inclusion criteria, the summary OR for H. pylori infection was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.61-0.99; 1-sided P = .002). Nine of the 14 studies reported ORs of &lt;1.0, and 6 of these studies reported statistically significant protective effects. Only 1 study reported a statistically significant OR of &gt;1.0. In studies in which the subjects resided in middle- or low-income nations, the summary OR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.33-0.93; P = .01), compared with 0.93 (95% CI, 0.73-1.19; P = .28) in studies in which subjects resided in high-income nations. The summary OR for studies that use the (13)C-urea breath test was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.32-1.39), compared with 0.91 (95% CI, 0.74-1.11) for studies that used the H. pylori IgG serologic test. We found no statistically significant dose-dependent protective effect against H. pylori associated with increasing duration of breast-feeding.
Almost all women (97.5% of sdNVP-exposed women and 91.3% of sdNVP-unexposed women; P = .21) achieved viral suppression by week 24, and similar percentages of sdNVP-exposed and -unexposed women (19.4% and 15.1%, respectively) experienced viral rebound within 78 weeks after treatment (P = .57). K103N was detected with the K103N allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay among sdNVP-exposed and -unexposed women before treatment; detection was strongly predictive of inadequate viral response: 60.9% of women for whom K103N was detected in either viral RNA or DNA did not experience viral suppression or experienced viral rebound, compared with 15.1% of women for whom K103N was not detected (P &lt; .001). After treatment, the M184V mutation occurred less frequently among sdNVP-exposed women than among sdNVP-unexposed women, but the frequency of NNRTI-associated mutations was similar between these groups of women with inadequate virologic response.
Rifampin resistance was observed in 173 (36.8%) of 470 recovered isolates and 167 (81.5%) of 205 of epidemic clone isolates (P &lt; .001). Six rpoB genotypes were associated with rifampin resistance. Of 8 patients exposed to rifamycins, 7 had rifampin-resistant C. difficile, compared with 166 of 462 unexposed patients (relative risk, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.3).
A total of 235 episodes of CAP (11%) occurred in patients who were admitted to the ICU, whereas the predictive rule identified 397 (19%) of 2102 episodes as severe CAP. The predictive rule and the decision for ICU admission agreed in 1804 (86%) of the episodes (kappa coefficient, 0.45), with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 88%, similar to the 2001 American Thoracic Society guidelines (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 90%) in predicting ICU admission. Severe CAP criteria had higher sensitivity (58% vs. 46%) and similar specificity (88% vs. 90%), compared with the 2001 American Thoracic Society guidelines in predicting hospital mortality. Invasive mechanical ventilation was the main determinant for ICU admission, followed by septic shock. In the absence of major criteria, ICU admission was not related to survival of patients with minor severity criteria.
Multiclass drug-resistance mutations (NRTI and PI) were detected in strains in 30% of patients; 52% had evidence of resistance to at least 1 ARV class. The reverse-transcriptase mutations M184V and K65R, which confer high-level resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine in HIV-2, were found in strains from 43% and 9% of patients, respectively. The Q151M mutation, which confers multinucleoside resistance in HIV-2, emerged in strains from 9% of patients. HIV-1-associated thymidine analogue mutations (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, and T215Y/F) were not observed, with the exception of K70R, which was present together with K65R and Q151M in a strain from 1 patient. Eight patients had HIV-2 with PI mutations associated with indinavir resistance, including K7R, I54M, V62A, I82F, L90M, L99F; 4 patients had strains with multiple PI resistance-associated mutations. The duration of ARV therapy was positively associated with the development of drug resistance (P = .02). Nine (82%) of 11 patients with HIV-2 with no [corrected] detectable ARV resistance had undetectable plasma HIV-2 RNA loads (&lt;1.4 log(10) copies/mL), compared with 3 (25%) of 12 patients with HIV-2 with detectable ARV resistance (P = .009). Patients with ARV-resistant virus had higher plasma HIV-2 RNA loads, compared with those with non-ARV-resistant virus (median, 1.7 log(10) copies/mL [range, &lt;1.4 to 2.6 log(10) copies/mL] vs. &lt;1.4 log(10) copies/mL [range, &lt;1.4 to 1.6 log(10) copies/mL]; P = .003).
A total of 153 patients were enrolled during a 3-year period; 70 patients received ribavirin, and 83 received placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the early mortality rate: 19 (27.1%) of 70 ribavirin recipients and 21 (25.3%) of 83 placebo recipients died (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.4). No statistically significant differences in secondary outcome measures were found.
The median duration of follow-up after orthotopic liver transplantation was 4 years. Thirty-six percent of recipients developed CSI after transplantation. The presence of MBL2 coding mutations in the donor was significantly associated with CSI in the recipient; the cumulative incidence function of infection was 55% in recipients of deficient livers, compared with 32% for recipients of wild-type livers (P = .002). Infection was not associated with recipient MBL2 genotype. Low MBL levels after orthotopic liver transplantation levels (mannan-binding &lt;1 microg/mL or C4 deposition &lt;0.2 C4 U/microL) were also associated with CSI (cumulative incidence function, 52% vs. 20%, P = .003; and cumulative incidence function, 54% vs. 24%, P = .007, respectively). In multivariate analysis, mutation in the MBL2 coding region of the donor (hazard ratio, 2.8; P = .005) and the use of cytomegalovirus prophylaxis (hazard ratio, 2.6; P = .005) were independently associated with CSI.
Class 1 integrons were detected in 68 (49%) of 139 uropathogenic E. coli isolates, 16 (72%) of 22 human and animal Salmonella isolates, and 120 (28%) of 436 nonhuman E. coli isolates. The most prevalent cassettes were those encoding aminoglycoside adenyltransferase A (aadA) and dihydrofolate reductase A (dfrA). Sequences of aadA1, dfrA12-orfF-aadA2, and dfrA17-aadA5 gene cassettes from 35 urinary tract infection E. coli isolates and of aadA2 and aadA12 gene cassettes from 7 Salmonella isolates were 100% identical to the corresponding cassette sequences from food animal E. coli isolates and those deposited in GenBank from a wide variety of bacteria isolated from animal hosts from distinct regions of the world.
From September 2003 through June 2008, a total of 328 (2.3%) of 14,005 specimens were HIV antibody positive, and 36 (0.3%) of 13,677 antibody-negative specimens were NAAT positive (indicating acute HIV infection). Among 6811 specimens obtained from MSM who were initially screened by rapid testing, OraQuick detected only 153 (91%) of 169 antibody-positive MSM and 80% of the 192 HIV-infected MSM detected by the HIV NAAT program. HIV was detected in serum samples obtained from 15 of 16 MSM with acute HIV infection that were retrospectively tested using the antigen-antibody combination assay.
The crude incidence rates for severe hypo- and hyperglycemia among those who received gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin were 0.35 and 0.45, 0.19 and 0.18, 0.10 and 0.12, and 0.07 and 0.10 cases per 1000 patients, respectively. Among patients with diabetes, the odds ratios for hypoglycemia compared with azithromycin were 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-6.6) for gatifloxacin, 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4-3.3) for levofloxacin, and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.6-2.0) for ciprofloxacin. The odds ratios for hyperglycemia were 4.5 (95% CI, 3.0-6.9) for gatifloxacin, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.7) for levofloxacin, and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.6-1.8) for ciprofloxacin.
HIV infection was present in 133 (12%) of 1071 consecutive parasitemic admitted children (95% confidence interval [CI], 11%-15%). Parasite densities were higher in HIV-infected children. The odds ratio for admission associated with HIV infection for admission with true severe falciparum malaria was 9.6 (95% CI, 4.9-19); however, this effect was restricted to children aged 1 year. Malnutrition was present in 507 (25%) of 2048 consecutive parasitemic admitted children (95% CI, 23%-27%). The odd ratio associated with malnutrition for admission with true severe falciparum malaria was 4.0 (95% CI, 2.9-5.5). IBI was detected in 127 (6%) of 2048 consecutive parasitemic admitted children (95% CI, 5.2%-7.3%). All 3 comorbidities were associated with increased case fatality.
Two hundred six STEC isolates were identified: 108 (52%) were non-O157 serotypes, and 98 (48%) were O157. Of non-O157 cases, 54% involved bloody diarrhea, and 8% involved hospitalization. Non-O157 isolates with at least stx2 were not more likely to cause severe illness (bloody diarrhea, hospitalization, or HUS) than were non-O157 isolates with only stx1. O157 cases were more likely than non-O157 cases to involve bloody diarrhea (78% vs 54%; P &lt; .001), hospitalization (34% vs 8%; P &lt; .001 and HUS (7% vs 0%; P = .005). When including only isolates with at least stx2, O157 cases were still more likely to involve bloody diarrhea (78% vs 56%; P = .02) and hospitalization (33% vs 12%; P = .01) than non-O157 cases.
We identified 90 articles describing &gt;28,000 patients with complicated SSSI. For cellulitis/erysipelas, cure rates were 66% (95% CI, 64%-68%) without antibiotics and 98% (95% CI, 96%-99%) for penicillin-treated patients, and penicillin reduced mortality by 10%. Cure rates for wound/ulcer infections were 36% (95% CI, 32%-39%) without antibiotics and 83% (95% CI, 81%-85%) for penicillin-treated patients. For major abscesses, cure rates were 76% (95% CI, 71%-80%) without antibiotics and 96% (95% CI, 94%-98%) for penicillin-treated patients; penicillin reduced mortality by 6%.
The overall rates of bacteremia were 12%-16% in the cohorts. The clinical probability estimate of developing bacteremia was based on 6 variables: liver disease, pleuritic pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, systolic hypotension, and absence of prior antibiotic treatment. For the score, 1 point was assigned to each predictive factor. In the derivation cohort, a cutoff score of 2 best identified the risk of bacteremia. In the validation cohorts, rates of bacteremia were &lt;8% for patients with a score 1 (43%-49% of patients), whereas blood culture results were positive in 14%-63% of cases for patients with a score 2.
The biologist conducted the necropsy in his garage without the use of personal protective equipment. Three days later, he developed fever and hemoptysis and died approximately 6 days after exposure. Gross examination showed consolidation and hemorrhagic fluid in the lungs; no buboes were noted. Plague was diagnosed presumptively by polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by culture. Tissues from the mountain lion tested positive for Y. pestis, and isolates from the biologist and mountain lion were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among 49 contacts who received chemoprophylaxis, none developed symptoms consistent with plague.
Thirty-five patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia were studied. The early microbiological response (ie, negative results for follow-up blood culture within 72 hours) was significantly higher in the linezolid-based salvage therapy group than the comparison group (75% vs 17%; P =.006). Adding aminoglycosides or rifampicin to vancomycin was not successful in treating any of the patients, whereas linezolid-based therapy gave an 88% salvage success rate P =.001). The S. aureus-related mortality rate was lower for patients treated with a linezolid salvage regimen than for patients continually treated with a vancomycin-based regimen (13% vs 53%; P =.030).
There were 149 patients who were treated for 23 months; they were identified as having a 25% decrease in CD4 cell count (from 375 to 216 cells/microL) and a CD4% percent decrease (from 19% to 15%); of these 149 patients, 86 (58%) were misclassified as having experienced treatment failure. Of 42 patients who had a 50% decrease in CD4 cell count, 18 (43%) were misclassified. In multivariate logistic regression, misclassification odds were associated with a higher CD4 cell count, a shorter duration of therapy, and a smaller CD4% percent decrease. By combining these variables, we may be able to improve our ability to predict treatment failure.
In all patients, anti-HCV treatment was started with pegylated interferon-alpha, and antiretroviral therapy was coadministered early during primary infection. HCV viremia was cleared under therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha in all 3 cases. In 2 patients, HIV replication was contained even after antiretroviral therapy had been interrupted, which was associated with strong HIV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses. In these 2 patients, multispecific HCV CD4(+) T cell responses could also be detected. No HCV-specific CD4(+) T cell responses were detected in the third patient, who also had the lowest nadir CD4(+) cell count during primary HIV infection (&lt;200 cells/microL).
By tracing sexual contacts related to the index case, we uncovered a cluster of 7 cases of amebiasis (3 with liver abscesses). Oral-anal sex was common in the group; the 5 female individuals were bisexual (4) or homosexual (1). The outbreak strain was genotyped, and cluster analysis indicated that this virulent strain differed substantially from asymptomatic or diarrheal E. histolytica isolates.
We prospectively enrolled 968 pregnant women from April 2007 through March 2008. The overall molecular GBS test yield was 89.2%. Among the 863 women with available results, the molecular GBS test had a sensitivity of 98.5%, specificity of 99.6%, positive predictive value of 97.8%, and negative predictive value of 99.7%. The positive predictive value of antenatal culture for identifying colonization status at delivery was low (58.3%), whereas the negative predictive value was imperfect (92.1%).
We identified 705 contacts of the 2 patients; all contacts had oropharyngeal specimens collected for culture. Only the index patient and the respiratory therapist yielded identical pulse-field gel electrophoresis GAS isolates, with clonality indicated by emm typing.
Of 323 families approached, 260 (80.5%) returned a completed questionnaire, and 175 (54.2%) children provided a blood sample. The median age at follow-up was 8.4 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.2-15.4 years), and the median duration of follow-up was 4.1 years (IQR, 3.5-9.7 years). Twenty-seven children (16.1%) had been born prematurely and/or had an underlying medical condition, and 18 (10.8%) had immunoglobulin deficiency. The median Hib antibody concentration was 0.70 microg/mL (IQR, 0.22-5.8 microg/mL). Overall, 95 children (56.9%) had antibody concentrations &lt;1.0 microg/mL, and 27 (16.2%) had antibody concentrations &lt;0.15 microg/mL. All 3 children with Down syndrome and 10 (42%) of 24 children aged &lt;5 years at follow-up had Hib antibody concentrations &lt;0.15 microg/mL. An antibody concentration &lt;0.15 microg/mL was independently associated with underlying conditions, young age at onset of Hib disease, and shorter time from Hib disease to follow-up.
Fourteen patients were identified. The mean gestational age was 30.1 weeks (range 24.4-40.7 weeks); three patients were full-term. Eleven had been on intravenous fentanyl for sedation; three were born to opioid-dependent mothers. All patients were treated with clonidine, administered in doses of 0.5-1.0 mcg/kg orally every 6 h. No patient received opioids. Mean duration of treatment was 6.8 days (range 4-15). Mean abstinence scores were 6.4 pretreatment (range 0-20) and 1.9 posttreatment (range 0-5). No patients suffered an adverse event (hypotension, bradycardia, excessive sedation, and oxygen desaturation) from clonidine administration, and no seizures were identified.
Overall mortality was 11% for olanzapine-treated animals and 45% for placebo. Olanzapine also appeared to alter the characteristics of seizures due to cocaine.
Potential markers of effect identified included paracetamol sales, poisons information data, laboratory results, liver unit referrals, and hospital activity and mortality data. Initial reports suggested effects associated with the legislation, but longer term suicide trend analysis has not confirmed these early findings, which were confounded by population trends in self-harm.
Between 2002 and 2007, there were a total of 1,565 potential heroin-related calls, and the calls increased by 63.6% in 2006 compared to 2005. In the prospective analysis, the principal model would have identified the outbreak in March 2006.
There is evidence of psychiatric, respiratory, cardiovascular, and bone toxicity associated with chronic cannabis use. Cannabis has now been implicated in the etiology of many major long-term psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, and an amotivational state. Respiratory conditions linked with cannabis include reduced lung density, lung cysts, and chronic bronchitis. Cannabis has been linked in a dose-dependent manner with elevated rates of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrythmias. It is known to affect bone metabolism and also has teratogenic effects on the developing brain following perinatal exposure. Cannabis has been linked to cancers at eight sites, including children after in utero maternal exposure, and multiple molecular pathways to oncogenesis exist.
Initial treatment consists of appropriate airway management and attention to acid-base abnormalities. Prompt use of fomepizole or ethanol is important in preventing the formation of the toxic metabolite HEAA; hemodialysis can also be critical, and assisted ventilation may be required.
537 patients (273 boys and 264 girls) were admitted to the hospital with intentional acute alcohol intoxication (1.5% of all admissions and 34.2% of all intoxications) between 1996 and 2005. The average age of the patients with alcohol intoxication presenting to hospital was 15.1 +/- 1.7 and the youngest were 9-year-old children. The proportion of children admitted with alcohol intoxication increased every year (R(2) = 0.935) (p &lt; 0.001). The average blood alcohol concentration was 1.98 +/- 0.57 g/L, and it increased in 2001-2005 in relation to the previous 5 years (p &lt; 0.001). The highest estimated alcohol concentration (4.39 g/L) was found in the blood of a 17-year-old boy. The mean poisoning severity score was 1.53 +/- 0.61 and had increased in line with blood alcohol concentration for the years 2001-2005 (p &lt; 0.001).
Over a 4-year period, 103 urine samples collected from mainly young people (age range 13-52 years, median 19) were studied. Among 53 cases where ingestion of any of the 11 plant-derived substances covered in this study was admitted or suspected, 41 (77%) could be confirmed bioanalytically. Nine of the 11 substances tested for were detected, the exceptions being ibogaine and yohimbine. Psilocin, originating from ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms, was the most frequent drug accounting for 54% of the cases. The most common means of drug acquisition (56%) was purchase over the Internet.
A total of 286 cases were identified. Mean age was 18.9 years (SD 15.7), with a range of 6 months-70 years. Seventy-seven patients (27%) were &lt;or=6 years, 80 patients (28%) were 7-17 years, and 129 patients (45%) were &gt;or=18 years. Doses were known in 255 patients (89%). Symptoms occurred in 158 patients (55%): somnolence 89 (56%), tachycardia 32 (20%, heart rate 102-186), nausea/vomiting 29 (18%), dystonic reactions 21 (13%), tremor 9 (6%), agitation 3 (2%), dizziness 3 (2%), paresthesia 2 (1%), headache 2 (1%), dysphagia 1 (&lt;1%), syncope 1 (&lt;1%), minor facial swelling 1 (&lt;1%), and hypotension 1 (&lt;1%). None of the patients required intubation, and there were no deaths or EKG abnormalities. Median dose for symptomatic and asymptomatic groups were 25 and 15 mg, respectively, for &lt;or=6 years (p = 0.02); 60 and 30 mg for 7-17 years (p = 0.01); and 100 and 75 mg for &gt;or=18 (p = 0.25). In comparison of drug groups (Group 1, &lt;or=20 mg; Group 2, 21-90 mg; Group 3, &gt;or=91 mg), symptoms were more likely to occur in Group 2 versus Group 1 (OR 2.29, 95% CI 0.79-6.61) in patients &lt;or=6 years; in Group 3 versus Group 1 (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.07-10.73) followed by Group 2 versus Group 1 (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.36-3.56) in patients 7-17 years; and in Group 3 versus Group 1 (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.54-3.42) but not any more likely in Group 2 versus Group 1 (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.33-2.52) in patients &gt;or=18 years.
The 537 respondents were 70% SPIs or poison information providers (PIPs), primarily educated in nursing or pharmacy, working across the United States and Canada, and employed by their current centers an average of 10 years. SPIs rated communication skills as extremely important to securing positive outcomes for PCC calls even though they reported that their own training was not strongly focused on communication and existing training in communication was perceived as only moderately useful. Ratings of the usefulness of 21 specific training units were consistently high, especially for new SPIs but also for experienced SPIs. Directors rated the usefulness of training for experienced SPIs higher for 5 of the 21 challenges compared to the ratings of SPIs.
Five studies were included. Four of the trials were of good quality. Compared to expectant management, active management (in the setting of a maternity hospital) was associated with the following reduced risks: maternal blood loss (weighted mean difference -79.33 millilitres, 95% confidence interval -94.29 to -64.37); post partum haemorrhage of more than 500 millilitres (relative risk 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.46); prolonged third stage of labour (weighted mean difference -9.77 minutes, 95% confidence interval -10.00 to -9.53). Active management was associated with an increased risk of maternal nausea (relative risk 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.51 to 2.23), vomiting and raised blood pressure (probably due to the use of ergometrine). No advantages or disadvantages were apparent for the baby.
Five studies met the inclusion criteria; two studies examined interprofessional rounds, two studies examined interprofessional meetings, and one study examined externally facilitated interprofessional audit. One study on daily interdisciplinary rounds in inpatient medical wards at an acute care hospital showed a positive impact on length of stay and total charges, but another study on daily interdisciplinary rounds in a community hospital telemetry ward found no impact on length of stay. Monthly multidisciplinary team meetings improved prescribing of psychotropic drugs in nursing homes. Videoconferencing compared to audioconferencing multidisciplinary case conferences showed mixed results; there was a decreased number of case conferences per patient and shorter length of treatment, but no differences in occasions of service or the length of the conference. There was also no difference between the groups in the number of communications between health professionals recorded in the notes. Multidisciplinary meetings with an external facilitator, who used strategies to encourage collaborative working, was associated with increased audit activity and reported improvements to care.
Seventeen eligible studies of 3,652 infants were included. Meta-analysis comparing HFOV with CV revealed no evidence of effect on mortality at 28 - 30 days of age or at approximately term equivalent age. These results were consistent across studies and in subgroup analyses. The effect of HFOV on CLD in survivors at term equivalent gestational age was inconsistent across studies and the reduction was of borderline significance overall. The effect was similar in trials with a high lung volume strategy for HFOV targeting at very low FiO(2) and trials with a high lung volume strategy with somewhat higher or unspecified target FiO(2). Subgroups of trials showed a significant reduction in CLD with HFOV when no surfactant was used, when piston oscillators were used for HFOV, when lung protective strategies for CV were not used, when randomisation occurred at two to six hours of age, and when inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2 was used for HFOV. In the meta-analysis of all trials, pulmonary air leaks occurred more frequently in the HFOV group.In some studies, short-term neurological morbidity with HFOV was found, but this effect was not statistically significant overall. The subgroup of two trials not using a high volume strategy with HFOV found increased rates of Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage and of periventricular leukomalacia. An adverse effect of HFOV on long-term neurodevelopment was found in one large trial but not in the five other trials that reported this outcome. The rate of retinopathy of prematurity is reduced overall in the HFOV group.
Nine trials, in which a total of 754 VLBW infants participated, were eligible for inclusion. These trials did not provide any evidence that early trophic feeding affected feed tolerance or growth rates in VLBW infants. Meta-analysis did not detect a statistically significant effect on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis: typical relative risk 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.67, 1.70); typical risk difference 0.01 (95% confidence interval -0.04, 0.05).
Four trials, involving a total of 237 participants, were included. All four trials were methodologically flawed and potentially biased.Three trials tested conservative treatment interventions. One trial, which compared short arm (below elbow) pre-fabricated functional braces with long arm (elbow included) plaster casts, found there was no significant difference in the time it took for fracture union. Patient satisfaction and return to work during treatment were significantly better in the brace group. The other two trials, both quasi-randomised, had three treatment groups. One trial compared Ace Wrap elastic bandage versus short arm plaster cast versus long arm plaster cast. The large loss to follow-up in this trial makes any data analysis tentative. However, the need for replacement of the Ace wrap by other methods due to pain indicates the potential for a serious problem with this intervention. The other trial, which compared immediate mobilisation versus short arm plaster cast versus long arm plaster cast for minimally displaced fractures, found no significant differences in outcome between these three interventions.The fourth trial, which compared two types of plates for surgical fixation, found no significant differences in functional or anatomical outcomes nor complications between the two groups.
Four RCTs involving 3925 women were identified and included in this review. All were high quality with minimal risk of bias. Three trials compared the addition of RT to BCS. One trial was a two by two factorial design comparing the use of RT and tamoxifen, each separately or together, in which participants were randomised in at least one arm. Analysis confirmed a statistically significant benefit from the addition of radiotherapy on all ipsilateral breast events (hazards ratio (HR) 0.49; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.59, P &lt; 0.00001) and ipsilateral DCIS recurrence (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.01, P = 0.05). Pooled analysis for invasive recurrence did not reach statistical significance. All the subgroups analysed benefited from addition of radiotherapy. No significant long-term toxicity from radiotherapy was found. No information about short-term toxicity from radiotherapy or quality of life data were reported.
Eleven trials involving 2301 people were included: six in adults, two in neonates, three in children. All but one examined use of steroids for the prevention of post-extubation stridor; the remaining one concerned treatment of existing post-extubation stridor in children. Patients were drawn from heterogeneous medical/surgical populations. Dexamethasone given intravenously at least once prior to extubation was the most common steroid regimen utilized (uniformly in neonates and children). In neonates the two studies found heterogeneous results, with no overall statistically significant reduction in post extubation stridor (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.32). One of these studies was on high-risk patients treated with multiple doses of steroids around the time of extubation, and this study showed a significant reduction in stridor. In children, the two studies were clinically heterogeneous. One study included children with underlying airway abnormalities and the other excluded this group. Prophylactic corticosteroids tended to reduce reintubation and significantly reduced post-extubation stridor in the study that included children with underlying airway abnormalities (N = 62) but not in the study that excluded these children (N = 153). In six adult studies (total N = 1953), the use of prophylactic corticosteroid administration did not significantly reduce the risk of re-intubation (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22). While there was a significant reduction in the incidence of post extubation stridor (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99), there was significant heterogeneity (I(2)=81%, X(2)=26.36, df=5, p&lt;0.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed that post extubation stridor could be reduced in adults with a high likelihood of post extubation stridor when corticosteroids were administered as multiple doses begun 12-24 hours prior to extubation compared to single doses closer to extubation; the test for interaction for multiple versus single doses indicated RRR 0.22 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.47) for stridor with multiple doses. Side effects were uncommon and could not be aggregated.
Seventy-two trials are included. Fifty-six randomised controlled trials (over 20,000 pregnant women) and nine cluster-randomised trials (over 5000 pregnant women) provided data on smoking cessation outcomes.There was a significant reduction in smoking in late pregnancy following interventions (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 0.96), an absolute difference of six in 100 women who stopped smoking during pregnancy. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the combined data (I(2) &gt; 60%). In the trials with the lowest risk of bias, the interventions had less effect (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99), and lower heterogeneity (I(2) = 36%). Eight trials of smoking relapse prevention (over 1000 women) showed no statistically significant reduction in relapse.Smoking cessation interventions reduced low birthweight (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) and preterm birth (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98), and there was a 53.91g (95% CI 10.44 g to 95.38 g) increase in mean birthweight. There were no statistically significant differences in neonatal intensive care unit admissions, very low birthweight, stillbirths, perinatal or neonatal mortality but these analyses had very limited power.
Twenty-eight studies (reporting a total of thirty-two comparisons) were included. Computer reminders achieved a median improvement in process adherence of 4.2% (interquartile range (IQR): 0.8% to 18.8%) across all reported process outcomes, 3.3% (IQR: 0.5% to 10.6%) for medication ordering, 3.8% (IQR: 0.5% to 6.6%) for vaccinations, and 3.8% (IQR: 0.4% to 16.3%) for test ordering. In a sensitivity analysis using the best outcome from each study, the median improvement was 5.6% (IQR: 2.0% to 19.2%) across all process measures and 6.2% (IQR: 3.0% to 28.0%) across measures of medication ordering. In the eight comparisons that reported dichotomous clinical endpoints, intervention patients experienced a median absolute improvement of 2.5% (IQR: 1.3% to 4.2%). Blood pressure was the most commonly reported clinical endpoint, with intervention patients experiencing a median reduction in their systolic blood pressure of 1.0 mmHg (IQR: 2.3 mmHg reduction to 2.0 mmHg increase).
Infection (primary outcome) and adverse events (secondary outcome).
Two trials comparing doxycycline with placebo met the inclusion criteria. We did not find trials comparing doxycycline versus other antibiotics, or other antibiotics versus placebo. One of the trials had excellent methodological quality. In the other trial, the allocation concealment process, generation of allocation sequence, and blinding methods were not described.Of the 1022 participants enrolled, 509 were treated with doxycycline and 513 with placebo. Of these, 940 participants were soldiers included in one trial. The patients assigned to the antibiotics group compared with the ones assigned to the placebo group showed: Symptomatic, verified leptospirosis: 0.6% (3/509) versus 4.9% (25/ 513); risk difference (random effects model) -4.1%, 95% confidence interval -5.9% to -2.3%. Number needed-to-treat 24 (95% confidence interval 17 to 43). Adverse effects: 3% (13/469 participants) versus 0.2% (1/471 participants); random effects model 2.6%, 95% confidence interval 1.0% to 4.1%. Number needed-to-harm 39 (95% confidence interval 25 to 100).
This update added 25 new RCTs, bringing the total to 55. Thirty-eight (69%) used at least one measure that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion: decision attributes: knowledge scores (27 trials); accurate risk perceptions (11 trials); and value congruence with chosen option (4 trials); and decision process attributes: feeling informed (15 trials) and feeling clear about values (13 trials).This review confirmed the following findings from the previous (2003) review. Decision aids performed better than usual care interventions in terms of: a) greater knowledge (MD 15.2 out of 100; 95% CI 11.7 to 18.7); b) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -8.3 of 100; 95% CI -11.9 to -4.8); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling unclear about personal values (MD -6.4; 95% CI -10.0 to -2.7); d) reduced the proportion of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). When simpler decision aids were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in knowledge (MD 4.6 out of 100; 95% CI 3.0 to 6.2) and there was some evidence of greater agreement between values and choice.In this review, we were able to explore the use of probabilities in decision aids. Exposure to a decision aid with probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9). The effect was stronger when probabilities were measured quantitatively (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) versus qualitatively (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5).As in the previous review, exposure to decision aids continued to demonstrate reduced rates of: elective invasive surgery in favour of conservative options, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9); and use of menopausal hormones, detailed versus simple aid (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.0). There is now evidence that exposure to decision aids results in reduced PSA screening, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0) . For other decisions, the effect on decisions remains variable.As in the previous review, decision aids are no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, continuance, resource use) were inconclusive.There were no trials evaluating the IPDAS decision process criteria relating to helping patients to recognize a decision needs to be made, understand that values affect the decision, or discuss values with the practitioner.
Seventy-two studies compared ibuprofen and placebo (9186 participants). Studies were predominantly of high reporting quality, and the bulk of the information concerned ibuprofen 200 mg and 400 mg. For at least 50% pain relief compared with placebo the NNT for ibuprofen 200 mg (2690 participants) was 2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) and for ibuprofen 400 mg (6475 participants) it was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6). The proportion with at least 50% pain relief was 46% with 200 mg and 54% with 400 mg. Remedication within 6 hours was less frequent with higher doses, with 48% remedicating with 200 mg and 42% with 400 mg. The median time to remedication was 4.7 hours with 200 mg and 5.4 hours with 400 mg. Sensitivity analysis indicated that pain model and ibuprofen formulation may both affect the result, with dental impaction models and soluble ibuprofen salts producing better efficacy estimates. Adverse events were uncommon, and not different from placebo.
Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.
Ten studies were identified from over 40 studies. A total of 2000 patients were analysed, 1002 had received reduced protein intake and 998 a higher protein intake. There were 281 renal deaths recorded, 113 in the low protein diet and 168 in the higher protein diet group (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84, P = 0.0002). To avoid one renal death, 2 to 56 patients need to be treated with a low protein diet during one year.
Seven studies were included in the review, three prevention trials (number of participants (n) = 2265) and four treatment trials (n = 1194). Only two studies reported sufficient information to complete data extraction fully. There was no evidence that homoeopathic treatment can prevent influenza-like syndrome (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 1.43). Oscillococcinum treatment reduced the length of influenza illness by 0.28 days (95% CI 0.50 to 0.06). Oscillococcinum also increased the chances that a patient considered treatment to be effective (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.00).
Twenty-two studies involving 1736 participants were included. The major comparisons were with methadone (5 studies) and clonidine or lofexidine (12 studies). Five studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction.Severity of withdrawal is similar for withdrawal managed with buprenorphine and withdrawal managed with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. It appears that completion of withdrawal treatment may be more likely with buprenorphine relative to methadone (RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.49, P = 0.18) but more studies are required to confirm this.Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine is more effective in ameliorating the symptoms of withdrawal, patients treated with buprenorphine stay in treatment for longer (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27, P &lt; 0.001), and are more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.06, P &lt; 0.001). At the same time there is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but drop-out due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine.
Of the five studies reviewed (n = 170), three were conducted antepartum and two postpartum. Four of the studies randomised participants to standard therapy or dexamethasone. One study compared dexamethasone with betamethasone. Dexamethasone versus control There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes of maternal mortality and morbidity due to placental abruption, pulmonary oedema and liver hematoma or rupture. Of the secondary maternal outcomes, there was a tendency to a greater platelet count increase over 48 hours, statistically significantly less mean number of hospital stay days (weighted mean difference (WMD) -4.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.13 to -1.87), mean interval (hours) to delivery (41 +/- 15) versus (15 +/- 4.5) (p = 0.0068) in favour of women allocated to dexamethasone.There were no significant differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity due to respiratory distress syndrome, need for ventilatory support, intracerebral hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and a five minute Apgar less than seven. The mean birthweight was significantly greater in the group allocated to dexamethasone (WMD 247.00, 95% CI 65.41 to 428.59).Dexamethasone versus betamethasone There were no significant differences in all the maternal and perinatal mortality and in primary morbidity outcomes.Women randomised to dexamethasone fared significantly better for: oliguria, mean arterial pressure, mean increase in platelet count, mean increase in urinary output and liver enzyme elevations.
We included eight studies involving approximately 10,000 participants. The active interventions were pravastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, clofibrate, and conjugated oestrogen. Fixed-effect analysis showed no overall effect on stroke recurrence but statin therapy alone had a marginal benefit in reducing subsequent cerebrovascular events in those with a previous history of stroke or TIA (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.00). There was no evidence that such intervention reduced all-cause mortality or sudden death (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.20). Three statin trials showed a reduction in subsequent serious vascular events (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82).
Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review, all were randomised clinical trials, two were double-blind. There were a total number of 1969 participants. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study, adequate in five studies and unclear in the remaining studies. The allocation of concealment was adequate in three studies and unclear in the remaining studies. Methadone appeared statistically significantly more effective than non-pharmacological approaches in retaining patients in treatment and in the suppression of heroin use as measured by self report and urine/hair analysis (6 RCTs, RR = 0.66 95% CI 0.56-0.78), but not statistically different in criminal activity (3 RCTs, RR=0.39; 95%CI: 0.12-1.25) or mortality (4 RCTs, RR=0.48; 95%CI: 0.10-2.39).
One hundred and twenty one trials with 6700 participants were included. In most trials, PRT was performed two to three times per week and at a high intensity. PRT resulted in a small but significant improvement in physical ability (33 trials, 2172 participants; SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22). Functional limitation measures also showed improvements: e.g. there was a modest improvement in gait speed (24 trials, 1179 participants, MD 0.08 m/s, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12); and a moderate to large effect for getting out of a chair (11 trials, 384 participants, SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.38). PRT had a large positive effect on muscle strength (73 trials, 3059 participants, SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00). Participants with osteoarthritis reported a reduction in pain following PRT(6 trials, 503 participants, SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.13). There was no evidence from 10 other trials (587 participants) that PRT had an effect on bodily pain. Adverse events were poorly recorded but adverse events related to musculoskeletal complaints, such as joint pain and muscle soreness, were reported in many of the studies that prospectively defined and monitored these events. Serious adverse events were rare, and no serious events were reported to be directly related to the exercise programme.
This updated review includes 20 studies, with 2641 participants. For oxycodone 15 mg alone compared with placebo, the NNT for at least 50% pain relief was 4.6 (95% Confidence Interval 2.9 to 11). For oxycodone 10 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg, the NNT was 2.7 (2.4 to 3.1). A dose response was demonstrated for this outcome with combination therapy. Duration of effect was 10 hours with oxycodone 10 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg, and 4 hours with half that dose. Fewer participants needed rescue medication over 6 hours at the higher dose. Adverse events occurred more frequently with combination therapy than placebo, but were generally described as mild to moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal.
Ten trials (1108 women) are included. Compared to placebo, mifepristone treated women were more likely to be in labour or to have a favourable cervix at 48 hours (risk ratio (RR) 2.41, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.70 to 3.42) and this effect persisted at 96 hours (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.96 to 5.92). They were less likely to need augmentation with oxytocin (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). Mifepristone treated women were less likely to undergo caesarean section (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92) but more likely to have an instrumental delivery (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.96). Women receiving mifepristone were less likely to undergo a caesarean section as a result of failure to induce labour (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.80). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular dose but a single dose of 200 mg mifepristone appears to be the lowest effective dose for cervical ripening (increased likelihood of cervical ripening at 72 hours (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.97). Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns were more common after mifepristone treatment (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.93), but there was no evidence of differences in other neonatal outcomes. There is insufficient information on the occurrence of uterine rupture/dehiscence in the reviewed studies.
Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One trial involving the "elective" use of HFOV randomized 118 infants at the start of CV. The other trial of "rescue" HFOV randomized 81 infants with later respiratory failure on CV. Neither trial showed evidence of a reduction in mortality at 28 days or in failed therapy on the assigned mode of ventilation requiring cross-over to the other mode. Neither study reported significant differences in the risk of pulmonary air leak, chronic lung disease (28 days or more in oxygen) or intracranial injury. In the study of elective HFOV, there was no difference noted in days on a ventilator or days in hospital. In the one rescue study, there was no difference in the risk of needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Meta-analysis showed that metformin is effective in achieving ovulation in women with PCOS with odds ratios of 2.21(CI 1.57 to 3.10) for metformin versus placebo and 3.93(CI 2.32 to 6.65) for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone. An analysis of pregnancy rates suggests a significant treatment effect for metformin and clomiphene (OR 1.58, CI 1.20 to 2.07). Nevertheless, these benefits were not translated into live birth rates.Metformin has a significant effect in reducing fasting insulin levels (WMD -4.20 mIU/L, CI -7.68 to -0.73); however, the reduction was only significant in the non-obese group (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2). Treatment effect on serum testosterone concentration was observed; but the magnitude of the reduction was greater in the non-obese group compared with the obese group (WMD -1.79 versus. -0.30 nmol/L). Metformin has no effect on serum lipid profiles. Metformin was also associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, but no serious adverse effects were reported.
Forty eight trials, examining 25 treatment comparisons, met the inclusion criteria of this review. These involved a total of 3371 mainly female and older patients with generally displaced, often comminuted and potentially or evidently unstable fractures. Nearly half of the trials compared surgery with plaster cast immobilisation. Summarising the outcomes was hampered by the variation between the studies in participant characteristics, interventions, quality of trial methodology and reporting, and outcome measurement. Surgical methods were usually associated with better anatomical appearance after fracture healing, but there was inadequate evidence to confirm that these had resulted in better functional and clinical outcomes for the patients.
We found seven RCTs, but were unable to perform any meta-analysis, because each trial looked at different populations, different therapies and considered different outcomes.
Eight randomised controlled trials (1418 women) were included.Caesarean section rate was not significantly different when comparing any specific treatment with routine antenatal care (ANC) including data from five trials with 1255 participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.12). However, when comparing oral hypoglycaemics with insulin as treatment for GDM, there was a significant reduction (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77, two trials, 90 participants). There was a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia with intensive treatment (including dietary advice and insulin) compared to routine ANC (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.88, one trial, 1000 participants). More women had their labours induced when given specific treatment compared to routine ANC (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57, two trials, 1068 participants). The composite outcome of perinatal morbidity (death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture and nerve palsy) was significantly reduced for those receiving intensive treatment for mild GDM compared to routine ANC (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.73, one trial, 1030 infants).There was a reduction in the proportion of infants weighing more than 4000 grams (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.63, one trial, 1030 infants) and the proportion of infants weighing greater than the 90th birth centile (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99, three trials, 223 infants) of mothers receiving specific treatment for GDM compared to routine ANC. However, there was no statistically significant difference in this proportion between infants of mothers receiving oral drugs compared to insulin as treatment for GDM.
For this update we included six additional studies; 21 trials in total. Seventeen trials included people with chronic non-specific neck or shoulder complaints, or non-specific upper extremity disorders. Over 25 interventions were evaluated; five main subgroups of interventions could be determined: exercises, manual therapy, massage, ergonomics, and energised splint. Overall, the quality of the studies was poor.In 14 studies a form of exercise was evaluated, and contrary to the previous review we now found limited evidence about the effectiveness of exercises when compared to massage and conflicting evidence when exercises are compared to no treatment. In this update there is limited evidence for adding breaks during computer work; massage as add-on treatment on manual therapy, manual therapy as add-on treatment on exercises; and some keyboard designs when compared to other keyboards or placebo in participants with carpal tunnel syndrome.
We identified 60 studies, enrolling 3802 recipients. Twenty-nine studies (2262 participants) compared calcium channel blockers (CCB) to placebo/no treatment, 10 studies (445 participants) compared angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) to placebo/no treatment and seven studies (405 participants) compared CCB to ACEi. CCB compared to placebo/no treatment (plus additional agents in either arm as required) reduced graft loss (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99) and improved glomerular filtration rate (GFR), (MD, 4.45 mL/min, 95% CI 2.22 to 6.68). Data on ACEi versus placebo/no treatment were inconclusive for GFR (MD -8.07 mL/min, 95% CI -18.57 to 2.43), and variable for graft loss, precluding meta-analysis. In direct comparison with CCB, ACEi decreased GFR (MD -11.48 mL/min, 95% CI -5.75 to -7.21), proteinuria (MD -0.28 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.10), haemoglobin (MD -12.96 g/L, 95% CI -5.72 to -10.21) and increased hyperkalaemia (RR 3.74, 95% CI 1.89 to 7.43). Graft loss data were inconclusive (RR 7.37, 95% CI 0.39 to 140.35). Other drug comparisons were compared in small numbers of participants and studies.
There were 34 included studies with 4495 women. The benefits of VH versus AH were speedier return to normal activities (mean difference (MD) 9.5 days), fewer febrile episodes or unspecified infections (odds ratio (OR) 0.42), and shorter duration of hospital stay (MD 1.1 days). The benefits of LH versus AH were speedier return to normal activities (MD 13.6 days), lower intraoperative blood loss (MD 45 cc), a smaller drop in haemoglobin (MD 0.55 g/dl), shorter hospital stay (MD 2.0 days), and fewer wound or abdominal wall infections (OR 0.31) at the cost of more urinary tract (bladder or ureter) injuries (OR 2.41) and longer operation time (MD 20.3 minutes). The benefits of LAVH versus TLH were fewer febrile episodes or unspecified infection (OR 3.77) and shorter operation time (MD 25.3 minutes). There was no evidence of benefits of LH versus VH and the operation time (MD 39.3 minutes) as well as substantial bleeding (OR 2.76) were increased in LH. For some important outcomes, the analyses were underpowered to detect important differences or they were simply not reported in trials. Data were absent for many important long-term outcome measures.
We analysed 14 trials with 429 participants. The overall effect of lower limb orthoses on walking disability (speed), walking impairment (step/stride length) and balance impairment (weight distribution in standing) was significant and beneficial. There was no significant effect on postural sway (balance impairment) or mobility disability but the numbers of studies and participants were low. However, these were all cross-over trials that looked at the immediate effect while wearing the orthosis; they did not assess the effects of wearing an orthosis over the long term. Upper limb orthoses showed no effect on upper limb function, range of movement at the wrist, fingers or thumb, nor pain. However, this was based on only three trials.
A significant risk reduction in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by 60% (relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% confidence interval CI 0.31 to 0.53; P &lt; 0.00001) and pulmonary embolism (PE) by 42% (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; P = 0.0007) was observed with heparin compared with placebo or no treatment. However, heparin resulted in a significant increase in major haemorrhage (RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.72; P = 0.004) and minor haemorrhage (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.41; P = 0.0008). There was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between LMWH and UFH. There was a statistically significant 72% risk reduction in major bleeding when LMWH was compared with UFH (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.78; P = 0.02).
Early surgery did not significantly affect walking speed in a trial including 20 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Both groups deteriorated during the 12 months follow-up. After one year, the mean difference (MD) of the 28 feet walking time was 0.00 seconds (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.83 to 0.83) and the MD of the 150 feet walking time was -2.88 seconds, favouring the control group (95% CI -8.18 to 2.42). Night splinting of the ankle did not significantly affect muscle force or range of movement about the ankle in a trial of 26 participants with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Improvements were observed in both the splinting and control groups. In a trial of 26 participants with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and 28 participants with myotonic dystrophy, 24 weeks of strength training significantly improved six-metre timed walk in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth group compared to the control group (MD 0.70 seconds, favouring strength training, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.17), but not in the myotonic dystrophy group (MD -0.20 seconds, favouring the control group, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.39). No significant differences were observed for the 50 metre timed walk in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease group (MD 1.90 seconds, favouring the training group, 95% CI -0.29 to 4.09) or the myotonic dystrophy group (MD -0.80 seconds, favouring the control group, 95% CI -5.29 to 3.69). In a trial of 65 participants with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, 26 weeks of strength training did not significantly affect ankle strength. After one year, the mean difference in maximum voluntary isometric contraction was -0.43 kg, favouring the control group (95%CI -2.49 to 1.63) and the mean difference in dynamic strength was 0.44 kg, favouring the training group (95%CI -0.89 to 1.77).
Meta-analysis in 2004 of the pooled results was limited because of the following problems.In Porsteinsson 2001, although the physicians having direct responsibility for patient care were blinded, a non-blinded physician, who had no direct contact with these physicians, adjusted divalproex sodium dosage on the basis of reports from blinded raters and from confidential laboratory reports. Therefore, because the physician who controlled therapy knew which patients were receiving divalproex, the trial did not satisfy the criterion of concealed allocation.In Tariot 2001, 54% of the treated patients dropped out compared with 29% of control patients. Of all treated patients, 22% dropped out because of adverse effects, and the study had to be discontinued prematurely.The third trial (Sival 2002) had a cross-over design. No results from the first phase of the study were available, and although the statistical section stated, "the t-test for independent samples is used to analyse the two-period cross-over trial", because the samples were not independent - they are the same patients in the treatment and placebo groups - a question must be raised about the correctness of the analyses.The valproate preparation used in the trials varied - one used short-acting sodium valproate, one long-acting divalproex sodium, and the third early-onset acting divalproex sodium. Average doses differed (480 mg/d - 1000 mg/d), as did duration of therapy (3 weeks - 6 weeks), and ways of evaluating patients and their response to therapy.A limited meta-analysis, pooling the results concerning adverse effects (Porsteinsson 2001, Tariot 2001) revealed the following: sedation occurred more frequently in patients treated with valproic acid than in controls. Urinary tract infection was more common among patients treated with valproic acid than controls.An updated systematic review (October 2008) of two new studies (Tariot 2005, Herrmann 2007) applied meta-analysis to the effect of valproate on agitation in demented patients and also combined these studies with the earlier reports to examine adverse effects among valproate treated patients. Because the study of Herrmann et al involved a cross-over design, only those results from the first part of this study were included in the updated review.The new meta-analysis of pooled results showed no improvement of agitation among valproate treated patients, compared with controls, and showed an increase in adverse events (falls, infection, gastrointestinal disorders) among valproate treated patients.
We included 1232 patients from 15 studies; 672 patients received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 560 patients were allocated to the control group. Both the topical and systemic lidocaine therapy significantly reduced the risk of postoperative sore throat (risk ratio (RR) 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.82). To evaluate the severity of sore throat on a visual analogue scale (VAS), 219 patients received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 152 patients were allocated to the control groups. The severity of sore throat was reduced (mean difference (MD) -11.9; 95% CI -16.44 to -7.32), an effect that neared statistical significance. The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies.
Two eligible studies of a total of 273 infants were included. Both studies were randomized controlled trials. One study treated 63 infants with vidarabine or placebo (Whitley 1980) and the other study treated 210 infants with aciclovir or vidarabine (Whitley 1991).In the study comparing vidarabine with placebo (Whitley 1980), infants with all forms of neonatal HSV disease were included [disseminated disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease alone, and skin, eye and mouth (SEM) disease].There was no significant reduction in the risk of mortality when analyzed as an entire group; however, mortality was significantly reduced when data from infants with CNS disease or disseminated disease were combined. There was no difference in the rate of neurological abnormalities in survivors at one year when analyzed as an entire group or by disease category.There was no difference between aciclovir and vidarabine (Whitley 1991) in preventing mortality from neonatal HSV disease, in preventing disease progression, in reducing the incidence of neurological abnormality at one year, or in the incidence of drug-induced renal or bone marrow toxicity. In infants with SEM disease, there was no significant difference in neurological outcome with aciclovir compared vidarabine treatment. Both drugs were well tolerated in the newborn period.
Fourteen studies (2086 patients) compared statins versus placebo or other lipid lowering agents. Compared to placebo, statins did not decrease all-cause mortality (10 studies, 1884 patients; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06) or cardiovascular mortality (9 studies, 1839 patients: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.40). There was a lower incidence of nonfatal cardiovascular events with statins compared to placebo in haemodialysis patients (1 study, 1255 patients; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99). Compared with placebo, statin use was associated with a significantly lower end of treatment average total cholesterol (14 studies, 1823 patients; MD -42.61 mg/dL, 95% CI -53.38 to -31.84), LDL cholesterol (13 studies, 1801 patients; MD -43.06 mg/dL, 95% CI -53.78 to -32.35) and triglycerides (14 studies, 1823 patients: MD -24.01 mg/dL, 95% CI -47.29 to -0.72). There was similar occurrence of rhabdomyolysis and elevated liver function tests with statins in comparison to placebo.
One trial (46 participants) was eligible for inclusion. After randomisation eight participants were withdrawn, mainly because they declined to participate in the trial. Data were analysed for 38 participants at the end of the trial. After a mean follow up of three years, hip core decompression and physical therapy did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone using the score from the original trial (an improvement of 18.1 points for those treated with intervention therapy versus an improvement of 15.7 points with control therapy). There was no significant statistical difference between groups regarding major complications (hip pain, relative risk (RR) 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.60; vaso-occlusive crises, RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.80); and acute chest syndrome, RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.56)). This trial did not report results on mortality or quality of life.
No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p&lt; 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74-1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.25) , congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59-1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81-1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.
Twenty-eight trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 25 provided data for meta-analyses. Randomisation was adequately concealed in a minority of studies, most did not use intention to treat analyses and most used self-reported symptoms as outcome measures. For the 23 trials (907 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD was -0.82 (95% CI -1.12, -0.51), indicating a large clinical effect. However, when we included only the three trials with adequate allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD was -0.42 (95% CI -0.88, 0.03) i.e. moderate, non-significant effect. The effect of exercise was not significantly different from that of cognitive therapy. There was insufficient data to determine risks and costs.
The search yielded 25 trials: 7 placebo-controlled trials made 4 different comparisons, 17 trials made 13 comparisons between 2 different COC regimens, and 1 additional trial compared a COC to an antibiotic. COCs reduced acne lesion counts, severity grades and self-assessed acne compared to placebo. Differences in the comparative effectiveness of COCs containing varying progestin types and dosages, though, were less clear. COCs that contained chlormadinone acetate or cyproterone acetate improved acne better than levonorgestrel, although this apparent advantage was based on limited data. A COC with cyproterone acetate might result in better acne outcomes than one with desogestrel; however, the three studies comparing these COCs produced conflicting results. Likewise, levonorgestrel showed a slight improvement over desogestrel in acne outcomes in one trial, but a second trial found the COC groups were similar.
Five new studies have been added to this updated review, which now includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 1457 patients. All the trials were of relatively short duration (12 weeks to 6 months). After treatment, patients treated with endothelin receptor antagonists could walk on average 33.7 metres (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.9 to 42.5 metres) further than those treated with placebo in a 6 minute walk test. Endothelin receptor antagonists improved more patients' World Health Organization/New York Heart Association (WHO/NYHA) functional class status than placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.1), and reduced the odds of functional class deterioration compared to placebo (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.42 ). There was a trend for endothelin receptor antagonists to reduce mortality (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.09), and limited data suggest that endothelin receptor antagonists improve Borg dyspnoea score and cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in symptomatic patients. Hepatic toxicity was not common, and endothelin receptor antagonists were well tolerated in this population.
We included eight trials, with a total of 679 patients, in this review. Results between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin were similar in terms of: a) death rate: odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.78; b) recurrence of pulmonary embolism: OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; c) major haemorrhagic events: OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.91 to 2.86; d) minor haemorrhagic events: OR 1.98; 95% CI 0.68 to 5.75.We found no trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to surgical intervention.Using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and heparin together compared to heparin alone appeared to reduce the need for further treatment for in-hospital events (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.71).Thrombolytics improved haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment and echocardiograms to a greater extent than heparin alone.
We included eight small trials (257 participants in total, with data available from 228). Study quality was often inadequate: in particular, concealment of allocation was not confirmed and there was an absence of blinding of outcome assessment. The antibiotic regimens, duration of treatment and follow-up varied between trials. Five trials compared oral versus parenteral antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission rate 12 or more months after treatment (risk ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.13; 3 trials). Antibiotic treatment for osteomyelitis was associated with moderate or severe adverse events in 4.8% of patients allocated oral antibiotics and 15.5% patients allocated parenteral antibiotics (risk ratio: 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 1.22; 4 trials). Single trials with very few participants found no statistical significant differences for remission or adverse events for the following three comparisons: parenteral plus oral versus parenteral only administration; two oral antibiotic regimens; and two parenteral antibiotic regimens. No trials compared different durations of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis, or adjusted the remission rate for bacteria species or severity of disease.
We included evaluations for 21 communities from five countries in two geographical regions in the world: Austria, Sweden and Norway, and Australia and New Zealand. Although positive results were reported for some communities, there was no consistent relationship between being a WHO designated Safe Community and subsequent changes in observed injury rates.
Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 1277 women, with 46 to 110 months follow-up, met the inclusion criteria. These trials had low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of three trials with adequate data, assessing 1008 women, indicated that women who received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy had better overall survival (OS) than those who did not (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93). Likewise, meta-analysis of four trials with adequate data, assessing 1170 women, indicated that women who received adjuvant chemotherapy had better progression-free survival (PFS) than those who did not (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84). The trials included in these meta-analyses gave consistent estimates of the effects of chemotherapy.Sub-group analysis suggested that women who had optimal surgical staging of their disease were unlikely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (HR for OS 1.22; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.37) whereas those who had sub-optimal staging did (HR for OS 0.63; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85). One trial showed a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy among women at high risk (HR for OS 0.48; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.72) but not among those at low risk (HR for OS 0.95; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.66). However, these sub-group findings could be due to chance.
We found two studies that examined this question. Neither study found any changes in professional behavior following an intervention that facilitated electronic retrieval of health information. There was some evidence of improvements in knowledge about the electronic sources of information reported in one study. Neither study assessed changes in patient outcomes or the costs of provision of the electronic resource and the implementation of the recommended evidence-based practices.
Fifty-one studies with more than 1.6 million participants were included. Twenty-seven of them were case-control studies, 23 cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial (RCT).Twenty-seven studies tried to establish an association between green tea consumption and cancer of the digestive tract, mainly of the upper gastrointestinal tract, five with breast cancer, five with prostate cancer, three with lung cancer, two with ovarian cancer, two with urinary bladder cancer one with oral cancer, three further studies included patients with various cancer diagnoses.The methodological quality was measured with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The 9 nested case-control studies within prospective cohorts were of high methodological quality, 13 of medium, and 1 of low. One retrospective case-control study was of high methodological quality and 21 of medium and 5 of low.Results from studies assessing associations between green tea and risk of digestive tract cancer incidence were highly contradictory. There was limited evidence that green tea could reduce the incidence of liver cancer. The evidence for esophageal, gastric, colon, rectum, and pancreatic cancer was conflicting. In prostate cancer, observational studies with higher methodological quality and the only included RCT suggested a decreased risk in men consuming higher quantities green tea or green tea extracts. However, there was limited to moderate evidence that the consumption of green tea reduced the risk of lung cancer, especially in men, and urinary bladder cancer or that it could even increase the risk of the latter. There was moderate to strong evidence that green tea consumption does not decrease the risk of dying from gastric cancer. There was limited moderate to strong evidence for lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer.
Despite the large amount of literature available regarding vision screening no trials designed to compare the prevalence of amblyopia in screened versus unscreened populations were found.
We included ten trials involving 1527 participants. The studies were heterogeneous in respect of: intensity of advocacy, outcome measures and duration of follow-up (immediately post-intervention to three years), permitting meta-analysis for only a minority of outcomes. Intensive advocacy (12 hours or more duration) may help terminate physical abuse in women leaving domestic violence shelters or refuges at 12-24 months follow-up (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80), but not at up to 12 months follow-up. The evidence indicates that intensive advocacy may improve quality of life at up to 12 months follow-up, but the confidence intervals included zero (WMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.46). Depression did not improve following intensive advocacy at up to 12 months follow-up (WMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.09), nor did psychological distress (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.06). Only two meta-analyses of brief advocacy interventions (less than 12 hours duration) were possible; an increased use of safety behaviours was consistent with the receipt of brief advocacy both at up to 12 months (WMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06) and at 12-24 months (WMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.92) follow up.
Ten studies (1230 children) were identified. There was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease at six months (3 studies, 379 children: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.11) and 12 months (3 studies, 498 children: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.62) in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of HSP compared with placebo or supportive treatment. In children with severe kidney disease, there was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease with cyclophosphamide compared with supportive treatment (1 study, 56 children: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.78) and with cyclosporin compared with methylprednisolone (1 study, 19 children: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06).
We identified four relevant high quality studies. One compared the haloperidol plus promethazine mix with midazolam (n=301), one with lorazepam (n=200), one with haloperidol alone (n=316) and one with olanzapine IM (n=300). In Brazil, haloperidol plus promethazine was an effective means of tranquillisation with over two thirds of people being tranquil or sedated by 30 minutes, but midazolam was more swift (n=301, RR 2.9 CI 1.75 to 4.80, NNH 5 CI 3 to 12). In India, compared with lorazepam, more people were tranquil or sedated by 30 minutes if allocated to the combination treatment (n=200, RR 0.26 CI 0.10 to 0.68, NNT 8 CI 6 to 17). Over the next few hours of treatment reported differences are negligible. One person given midazolam had respiratory depression (0.7%, reversed by flumazenil); one given lorazepam (1%) had respiratory difficulty. About 1% of people given any haloperidol treatment experienced a seizure. By 20 minutes intramuscular haloperidol plus promethazine was more tranquillising than intramuscular haloperidol (1 RCT, n=316, RR 0.65 CI 0.49 to 0.87, NNT 7 CI 5 to 17). Haloperidol given without promethazine in this situation causes frequent serious adverse effects (NNH 15 CI 14 to 40). Olanzapine is as rapidly tranquillising as the haloperidol/promethazine combination (1 RCT, n=300, RR tranquil or asleep at 15 mins 0.74 CI 0.38 to 1.41), but did not have an enduring effect and more people needed additional drugs within four hours (1 RCT, n=300, RR 0.48 CI 0.33 to 0.69, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8) and to be re-assessed by the doctor (1 RCT, n=300, RR 0.47 CI 0.30 to 0.73, NNT 6 CI 5 to 12).
22 short-term (&lt;= 16 weeks) RCTs were included in the analysis (2519 participants). The majority of the trials assessed the efficacy of the SSRIs (N = 15).Medication and placebo response occurred in 58.1% and 31.5% of patients, respectively (Number of studies (N) = 14, Number needed to treat (NNT) = 4). Medication was more effective than placebo in reducing overall symptom severity in OCD in a post-hoc comparison (N = 7, Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) = -4.45, 95%CI = -5.94, -2.97, n = 765). Medication was less well tolerated than placebo overall, though the absolute proportion of participants who withdrew due to drug-related adverse events was low (4.9%).
The two studies included in this trial used different kinds of aerobic activity: walking/jogging and rowing training. One included study was conducted in the USA, the other in Portugal. In the meta-analyses, only maximal treadmill grade, a work performance variable, was improved in the intervention group after aerobic exercise training programmes (-4.26 [95% CI -6.45, -2.06]) grade. The other outcomes in the meta-analysis showed no significant differences between intervention and control groups, as expressed by weighted mean difference: VO(2) peak -0.30 (95% CI -377, 3.17) mL.Kg.min(-1); peak heart rate, -2.84 (95% CI -10.73, 5.05) bpm; respiratory exchange ratio, 0.01 (95% CI -0.04, 0.06); pulmonary ventilation, -5.86 (95% CI -16.06, 4.34) L.min(-1). 30 other measures including work performance, oxidative stress and body composition variables could not be combined in the meta-analysis. Apart from work performance, trials reported no significant improvements in these measures.
Eleven studies involving 2441 participants were included in this review. Three results were non significant and one result was significant mean alcohol consumption per week change scores from baseline (P0.02).
Three trials were included. Two trials enrolling 325 participants, of whom 297 (91%) were assessed and compared radiotherapy and chemotherapy with radiotherapy alone found that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36 to 0.87) and disease progression (HR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.30 to 0.74), with no heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 0% for both meta-analyses). One trial assessing 71 participants compared chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone and found no significant difference between the two groups (HR = 1.34; 95%CI: 0.24 to 7.66). The median follow up of patients varied from 29 to 42 months.
Ten RCTs with 531 participants met our inclusion criteria: intramyometrial vasopressin and analogues (two trials), intravenous oxytocin (two trials), and one RCT for each of the interventions vaginal misoprostol, peri-cervical tourniquet, chemical dissection with sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (mesna), intramyometrial bupivacaine plus epinephrine, tranexamic acid and the enucleation of myoma by morcellation while it is attached to the uterus. We found significant reductions in blood loss with misoprostol (MD -149.00 ml, 95% CI -229.24 to -68.76), vasopressin and analogues (MD -298.72 ml, 95% CI -593.10 to -4.34), bupivacaine plus epinephrine (MD -68.60 ml, 95% CI -93.69 to - 43.51), tranexamic acid (MD -243 ml, 95% CI -460 to -25.98), and peri-cervical tourniquet (MD -1870.00 ml, 95% CI -2547.16 to -1192.84). There was no evidence of effect on blood loss with myoma enucleation by morcellation or oxytocin. The trials did not assess the tolerability and costs of the different interventions.
At present, eligible first line trials for this meta-analysis were available for bevacizumab (5 trials including 3101 patients) and vatalanib (1 trial which included 1168 patients). The overall HR s for PFS (0.61, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.83) and OS (0.81, 95% 0.73 - 0.90) for the comparison of first-line chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, confirms significant benefits in favour of the patients treated with bevacizumab. However, the effect on PFS shows significant heterogeneity. For second-line chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, a benefit in both PFS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 - 0.73) and OS (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89) was demonstrated in a single, randomized trial. While differences in treatment-related deaths and 60-day mortality were not significant, higher incidences in grade III/IV hypertension, arterial thrombembolic events and gastrointestinal perforations were observed in the patients treated with bevacizumab. For valatanib, currently available data showed a non-significant benefit in PFS and OS.
Four RCTs that included 857 patients (number range: 30 to 485) met the inclusion criteria. The studies have a high risk of bias; three RCTs were conducted in the United States and one was a multi-national, multi-centre RCT performed in France and Italy. One of the trials included only men. It was impossible to pool data for any of the outcomes due to the differences in the interventions assessed in these RCTs. Overall survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Disease free survival (DFS) was reported in two of the four RCTs, but it was not statistically significant between treatment groups.
We identified nine potentially eligible RCTs, three of which met our inclusion criteria. One trial compared Trizivir to efavirenz (an NNRTI) plus two or three NRTIs; the second trial compared Trizivir to a treatment based on the PI nelfinavir; and the third compared Trizivir to atazanavir (a PI) plus two NRTIs. Overall, there was no significant difference in the incidence of virological failure between participants on Trizivir and those on PI-based or NNRTI-based therapy (three trials, N=1687; RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.32). However, there was significant heterogeneity between the results of the three trials (heterogeneity P=0.009, I(2)=79%), with a significant increase in virological failure for Trizivir compared to efavirenz (N=1147; RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.55) but no difference between Trizivir and PIs (two trials, N=540; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.36). We found no significant differences between Trizivir and either the PI or NNRTI on CD4+ cell counts (standardized mean difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.09, heterogeneity P=0.59, I(2)=0%), severe adverse events (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.25, heterogeneity P=0.03, I(2)=73%) and hypersensitivity reactions (RR 4.04, 95% CI 0.41 to 40.02, heterogeneity P=0.03, I(2)=72%). Only the studies involving PIs reported the effect of the treatment regimens on the lipid profile. One study found that at 96 weeks, the mean increase in total cholesterol from baseline was significantly lower with Trizivir than with nelfinavir, but there were no significant differences with triglyceride levels. The second study found the fasting lipid profile to be comparable in both the Trizivir and atazanavir arms at 48 weeks.
Meta-analysis was performed to pool the results of 18 studies. There were no data on clinical outcomes for the primary outcome and all studies used immunogenicity and reactogenicity (adverse events). In two immunological responses the combined vaccine achieved lower responses than the separate vaccines for HIB and HBV. Comparison found little heterogeneity. No significant differences in immunogenicity were found for pertussis, diphtheria, polio and tetanus. Serious adverse events were comparable. Minor adverse events were more common in children given the combined vaccine.
We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all pregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with methylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients in the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas none of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, one to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local complications of steroid injection were noted.
No trial could be included in the present review. All of the prospective trials that were identified, all dealing with endodontic surgery, had to be excluded for various reasons. Only one RCT was identified comparing three magnificators (magnifying loupes, surgical microscope, endoscope) in endodontic surgery. No RCT was found that compared the outcome of endodontic therapy using or without using a given magnification device.
We were unable to find any trials of family support in reducing the morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons in developing countries.
Twenty-four trials involving 4422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analysed results by intention to treat; we re-analysed the remainder.Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.02); metallic taste, and nausea and vomiting were more common in the metronidazole group (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.59; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.51, respectively). Given intravaginally as gelatin tablets, lactobacillus was more effective than oral metronidazole (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.08). Similarly, oral lactobacillus combined with metronidazole was more effective than metronidazole alone (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.77). Clindamycin showed a lower rate of clinical failure than triple sulfonamide cream (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72). Hydrogen peroxide douche showed a higher rate of clinical failure (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.00) and adverse events (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.52) than a single 2 g dose of metronidazole.
We included 11 studies with a total of 1754 participants. Many trials were of only moderate methodological quality and did not report on compliance with the prescribed therapy. Data from only 1160 patients could be included in the meta-analysis. Three trials (120 patients) compared the effects of incentive spirometry with no respiratory treatment. Two trials (194 patients) compared incentive spirometry with deep breathing exercises. Two trials (946 patients) compared incentive spirometry with other chest physiotherapy. All showed no evidence of a statistically significant effect of incentive spirometry. There was no evidence that incentive spirometry is effective in the prevention of pulmonary complications.
We included nine studies involving 499 participants. We found no evidence for a benefit on the primary variable, post-test gait function, based on three studies with 269 participants. Uni-dimensional performance variables did show significant effects post-test. Gait speed increased by 0.07 metres per second (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.10) based on seven studies with 396 participants, timed up-and-go (TUG) test improved by 1.81 seconds (95% CI -2.29 to -1.33), and six-minute-walk test (6MWT) increased by 26.06 metres (95% CI 7.14 to 44.97) based on four studies with 181 participants. We found no significant differences in deaths/disabilities or in adverse effects, based on published reports or personal communication from all of the included studies.
Five RCTs with a total of 1397 patients were included. Pooled data yielded a significantly worse overall survival (OS) for RT plus EPO as compared to RT alone (Peto odds ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005, five trials). For local regional tumour control (LRTC) analyses resulted in a small but non-significant difference between the RT alone group and the RT plus EPO group (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.03; P = 0.15, four trials). In addition, the local regional progression free survival (LRPFS) measured in four studies was significantly different between groups (Peto odds ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.80; P = 0.0002, four trials), in favour of the RT alone group. Two studies used supplemental iron in the RT plus EPO group and not in the RT alone group. When excluding these studies from the analyses, the statistically (non-) significant differences in OS, LRTC and LRPFS are maintained.
Of the five trials identified as potentially relevant from our searches, only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial randomly assigned 146 volunteer participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily) for 12 weeks. The trial reported 65 occurrences of the common cold in the placebo group compared with 24 in the garlic intervention group (P &lt; 0.001). The number of days of illness was lower in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Because only one trial met the inclusion criteria, limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self-reported episodes of the common cold, but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour.
Six RCTs published between 1990 and 2007 were identified. A total number of 520 patients was treated, 258 in the radiotherapy only arm (RT) and 262 in the radiotherapy-hyperthermia arm (RHT). Four studies (424 patients) reported overall survival (OS) rates. After 2 years, OS was significantly better in the RHT group (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.33-3.17; p=.001), but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 year OS). All but one studies reported CR rates. A significant higher CR rate was observed in the RHT group (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.22-6.45; p=.01). Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity. In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between the RT and the RHT group. Late toxicity data were not reported.
Three small (range of number of participants 28 to 60) randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Even though results from individual studies did not find that one combination strategy is better than the others, the methodological quality of included studies was too low to allow authors to use the collected data to answer the research question correctly.
Three small studies, one at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk of bias, were included. Meta-analysis was precluded due to different interventions and outcome measures. Study participants also had differing durations of symptoms and data for pain and function could only be extracted from one study. One placebo-controlled trial (20 participants) tested 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patches, used daily for three days, among participants with 'acute supraspinatus tendinitis' of less than seven days duration. Treatment resulted in reduced pain intensity (adjusted MD -3.50, 95% CI -3.96 to -3.04). Function was not measured. One trial (53 participants) compared one quarter of a 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patch used daily for up to 24 weeks combined with rehabilitation to placebo patches and rehabilitation among participants with 'supraspinatus tendinopathy' for longer than six months. A third trial (48 participants) tested 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patches, used daily for three days, compared to corticosteroid injection among participants with 'rotator cuff tendinitis' of less than six-weeks duration. Fifteen out of 24 participants in the glyceryl trinitrate treatment reported headache (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96).
This review includes nine RCTs, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo, and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. A total of 1064 patients with the common cold were included. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score, or duration of colds.However, for outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) NSAIDs produced significant benefits, and malaise showed a borderline benefit, although throat irritation was not improved. Chills showed mixed results. For respiratory symptoms, cough and nasal discharge scores were not improved, but the sneezing score significantly improved. We found no evidence of increased frequency of adverse effects in the NSAID treatment groups.
Twenty-one studies were included. One study evaluated a strategy to reduce noise exposure. Fourteen studies with 75,672 participants evaluated hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs), and six studies with 169 participants evaluated hearing protection. The overall quality of studies was low.One ITS study evaluated the effect of new legislation in reducing noise exposure. It found that the median noise level decreased by 27.7 dB(A) (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 dB) with a change in trend in time of -2.1 dB per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7).A hearing protection study in army recruits compared those exposed to impulse noise with non-exposed recruits. The odds ratio (OR) for hearing loss was 3.0 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.0) despite hearing protection. In four studies, workers in a HLPP had a 0.5 dB HL greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than non-noise exposed workers (95% CI -0.5 to 1.7). In one study, the hazard ratio of hearing loss was 3.8 (95% CI 2.7 to 5.3) for workers exposed to noise compared to non-exposed workers.In three studies, a high quality HLPP had a lower risk of hearing loss than lower quality programmes.Noise attenuation ratings of hearing protection under field conditions were consistently lower than the ratings provided by the manufacturers.
Of 7,019 abstracts identified (6,384 from original searches plus 635 from updated searches), 17 abstracts were identified as meeting criteria for potential inclusion (15 from previous review plus an additional two RCTs). After restricting inclusion to RCTs, a total of three studies were eligible for inclusion in this updated review.All three trials showed individual beneficial effects of helminth eradication on markers of HIV-1 disease progression (HIV-1 RNA and/or CD4 counts). When data from these trials were pooled, the analysis demonstrated significant benefit of deworming on both plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 counts.
We included 17 trials, all from developed countries, involving 1796 children, their parents or both. Eight trials assessed parental presence. None showed significant differences in anxiety or co-operation of children during induction, except for one where parental presence was significantly less effective than midazolam in reducing children's anxiety at induction. Six trials assessed interventions for children. Preparation with a computer package improved co-operation compared with parental presence (one trial). Children playing hand-held video games before induction were significantly less anxious than controls or premedicated children (one trial). Compared with controls, clown doctors reduced anxiety in children (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS): mean difference (MD) 30.75 95% CI 15.14 to 46.36; one trial). In children undergoing hypnosis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards reduced anxiety during induction (mYPAS &lt; 24: risk ratio (RR) 0.59 95% CI 0.33 to 1.04 - 39% versus 68%: one trial) compared with midazolam. A low sensory environment improved children's co-operation at induction (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.95; one trial) and no effect on children's anxiety was found for music therapy (one trial).Parental interventions were assessed in three trials. Children of parents having acupuncture compared with parental sham-acupuncture were less anxious during induction (mYPAS MD 17, 95% CI 3.49 to 30.51) and more children were co-operative (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.99). Parental anxiety was also significantly reduced in this trial. In two trials, a video viewed preoperatively did not show effects on child or parental outcomes.
Five short-term studies involving 1125 participants met the inclusion criteria. All the studies were of poor methodological quality and had a high probability of selection, detection and performance bias.Two studies assessed seizure freedom for one year. One found no difference between Xiaxingci granule and phenytoin for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.07 to 14.90).The other study found no difference between Dianxianning pill and valproate (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.74 to 227.72) for different types of epilepsy.Three studies assessed a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. One found an advantage for Tianmadingxian capsule when compared to phenytoin (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.53) in different types of epilepsy, the second an advantage for Zhixian I pill when compared to phenytoin (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48) in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and the third an advantage for an 'Antiepilepsy capsule' when compared to phenobarbital (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43) for primary and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure. One study reported the incidence of adverse effects and the Peto odds ratio was 0.04 (99% CI 0.01 to 0.12, P &lt; 0.00001) favouring TCMH compared to phenobarbital.
Eight trials were included involving a total of 1366 HD patients. The duration of the studies ranged between 30 and 144 weeks (median: 52 weeks). The following interventions were selected: vitamin E, Idebenone, Baclofen, Lamotrigine, creatine, coenzyme Q10 + Remacemide, ethyl-eicosapentanoic acid and Riluzole. No trials produced positive results for the selected efficacy outcome measures. A descriptive summary of the trials is provided. The selected interventions were found to be generally safe and well tolerated.
22 trials (1254 participants) were included. Nine trials had a cross-over design and 13 were conducted in parallel. Study duration ranged from 2 to 80 weeks. Various pharmacological interventions were studied, mostly, they were anti-dopaminergic drugs (n = 5), glutamate receptor antagonists (n = 5) and energy metabolites (n = 5). Only tetrabenazine showed a clear efficacy for the control of chorea. The remaining pharmacological interventions revealed no clear effectiveness.
We included three multifaceted and six monofaceted intervention studies (3271 children). Physician diagnosed asthma in children less than five years, and asthma as defined by respiratory symptoms and lung function criteria in children aged five years and older, both favoured treatment with a multifaceted intervention compared to usual care (&lt; 5 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, and &gt; 5 years: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85). However, there was no significant difference in outcome between monofaceted intervention and control interventions (&lt; 5 years: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.64, and &gt; 5 years: OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.16). Indirect comparison between these treatments did not demonstrate a significant difference between multiple interventions and mono-interventions in reducing the frequency of asthma diagnosis in children under five years (relative OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07) or five years and older (relative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13, P = 0.12). There was also no significant difference between either mono- and multifaceted intervention and control in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of nocturnal coughing at follow up. Wheezing, however, showed a significant difference between multifaceted and mono-interventions (relative OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), but the significance was lost when data on treatment only was analysed.
We found only one completed controlled trial using intravenous methylprednisolone in diabetic amyotrophy (Dyck 2006). The results have not been fully published and were not available for analyses.
A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in the meta-analysis.Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95% confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs.
We found nine studies which randomised 2216 people: four unilateral trials, three bilateral trials and two trials that included both a unilateral and a bilateral study arm.Overall, the studies were of moderate quality. Only half of the trials reported adequate allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment and masking of visual acuity outcome assessors.Although two (of the nine) studies reported significant drusen disappearance at two years, photocoagulation did not appear to affect the development of CNV at two years follow up (nine studies, 1767 people followed up, odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51) or the loss of three or more lines of visual acuity (six studies, 1628 people followed up, OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.82).
Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Both these trials described adequate methodology. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment.There was no evidence of a significant difference in rates of symptomatic relief between CHM and gestrinone administered subsequent to laparoscopic surgery (95.65% versus 93.87%; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.12, one RCT). The intention-to-treat analysis also showed no significant difference between the groups (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). There was no significant difference between the CHM and gestrinone groups with regard to the total pregnancy rate (69.6% versus 59.1%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.59, one RCT).CHM administered orally and then in conjunction with a herbal enema resulted in a greater proportion of women obtaining symptomatic relief than with danazol (RR 5.06, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.05; RR 5.63, 95% CI 1.47 to 21.54, respectively).Overall, 100% of women in all the groups showed some improvement in their symptoms.Oral plus enema administration of CHM showed a greater reduction in average dysmenorrhoea pain scores than did danazol (mean difference (MD) -2.90, 95% CI -4.55 to -1.25; P &lt; 0.01).Combined oral and enema administration of CHM showed a greater improvement, measured as the disappearance or shrinkage of adnexal masses, than with danazol (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.78). For lumbosacral pain, rectal discomfort, or vaginal nodules tenderness, there was no significant difference either between CHM and danazol.
Sixty-eight trials (42,981 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Iron supplementation did not increase the risk of clinical malaria (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 22,724 children, 14 trials, random-effects model). The risk was similar among children who were non-anaemic at baseline (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.09). An increased risk of malaria with iron was observed in trials that did not provide malaria surveillance and treatment. The risk of malaria parasitaemia was higher with iron (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.26), but there was no difference in adequately concealed trials. Iron + antimalarial was protective for malaria (four trials). Iron did not increase the risk of parasitological failure when given during malaria (three trials). There was no increased risk of death across all trials comparing iron versus placebo (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.36; 21,272 children, 12 trials). Iron supplementation increased haemoglobin, with significant heterogeneity, and malaria endemicity did not affect this effect. Growth and other infections were mostly not affected by iron supplementation.
Five RCTs were identified and included reporting data on 239 patients in total. On a patient, rather than per implant basis, the meta-analyses showed no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures, though trends, especially in fully edentulous patients, favoured 2-stage (submerged) implants.
Three randomised trials with a total of 261 patients were eligible for inclusion. The risk of bias was high in all trials. Two of the trials compared PEI with PAI. Overall survival (HR 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 3.19) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.42; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.94) were not significantly different. Data on the duration of hospital stay were inconclusive. Data on quality of life were not available. There were only mild adverse events in both treatment modalities.The other trial compared PEI with surgery. There was no significant difference in overall survival (HR 1.57; 95% CI 0.53 to 4.61) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.35; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.63). No serious adverse events were reported in the PEI group. Three postoperative deaths occurred in the surgery group.
Twenty-two studies were included (7,275 participants).Alcohol related problems: Significant reduction with Web/computer feedback (WF) (SMD -0.31 95% Cl -0.59 to -0.02), three studies, 278 participants. No significant effect of mailed feedback (MF), individual face-to-face feedback (IFF) or group face-to-face feedback (GFF).Peak Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) : Significant reduction with WF (SMD -0.77 95% Cl -1.25 to -0.28), two studies, 198 participants. No significant effect of MF or IFF.Drinking Frequency: Significant reduction with WF (SMD -0.38 95% Cl -0.63 to -0.13), two studies, 243 participants and IFF (SMD -0.39 95% Cl -0.66 to -0.12), two studies, 217 participants. No significant effect of MF.Drinking Quantity: Significant reduction with WF (SMD -0.35 95% Cl -0.51 to -0.18), five studies, 556 participants and GFF (SMD -0.32 95% Cl -0.63 to -0.02) three studies, 173 participants. No significant effect of MF or IF.Binge drinking: Significant reduction with WF (SMD -0.47 95% Cl -0.92 to -0.03) one study, 80 participants, IFF (SMD -0.25 95% Cl -0.49 to -0.02) three studies, 278 participants and and GFF (SMD -0.38 95% Cl -0.62 to -0.14) four studies, 264 participants. No significant effect for MF.BAC: No significant effect of MF and IFFDrinking norms: Significant reduction with WF (SMD -0.75 95% Cl -0.98 to -0.52 ) three studies, 312 participants.
There were no randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials identified from the search.
Five RCTs met the pre-specified inclusion criteria for this review. No trials evaluated strict glycaemic control in the immediate pre-operative period or outside the intensive care unit. Due to heterogeneity in patient populations, peri-operative period, glycaemic target, route of insulin administration, and definitions of outcome measures, combination of the results of the five included trials into a meta-analysis was not appropriate. The methodological quality of the trials was variable. In terms of outcomes, only one trial demonstrated a significant reduction in SSIs with strict glycaemic control, but the quality of this trial was difficult to assess as a result of poor reporting; furthermore the baseline rate of SSIs was high (30%). The other trials were either underpowered to detect a difference in SSIs, due to a low baseline rate (less than or equal to 5%), or did not report SSIs as a single outcome but as part of a composite. Of the three trials reporting hypoglycaemia (which was not consistently defined) all had a higher rate in the strict glycaemic control group but none attributed significant morbidity to the hypoglycaemia. Adequacy of glucose control between groups was measured differently among studies. Studies could not be compared due to differences in target ranges, and were susceptible to measurement bias due to differences in frequency of measurement and lack of blinding by the providers following the glycaemic protocols. Infection-related mortality was not reported in any of the trials, and no trials demonstrated a significant difference in all-cause mortality. Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the strict glycaemic control groups in only one trial.
We identified and included five eligible trials with a total of 167 patients. The investigators administered various G-CSF preparations, at different doses and for different durations of time. Adding G-CSF did not significantly affect the likelihood of resolution of infection or wound healing, but it was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of lower extremity surgical interventions (RR 0.37; 95 % CI 0.20 to 0.68), including amputation (RR 0.41; 95 % CI 0.18 to 0.95). Moreover, providing G-CSF reduced the duration of hospital stay (MD, -1.40 days; 95 % CI, -2.27 to -0.53 days), but did not significantly affect the duration of systemic antibiotic therapy (MD, -0.27 days; 95 % CI, -1.30 to 0.77 days).
We identified two studies with a total of 79 participants. One study, with 41 participants, compared cyclobenzaprine with clonazepam and with placebo. Participants taking cyclobenzaprine had some improvement of pain intensity compared to those on clonazepam, mean difference (MD) -0.25 (95% CI, -0.41 to -0.09; P value 0.002) and placebo, MD -0.25 (95% CI, 0.41 to -0.09; P value 0.002). The other study, with 38 participants, compared cyclobenzaprine with lidocaine infiltration. Thirty days after treatment there were statistically non-significant differences between comparison groups, favoring lidocaine infiltration, for the mean for global pain, MD 0.90 (95% CI -0.35 to 2.15, P value 0.16), and for the mean for pain at digital compression, MD 0.60 (95% CI -0.55 to 1.75, P value 0.30). There were no life-threatening adverse events associated with the medications.
One trial using parallel design met the inclusion criteria of this review; no meta-analysis was performed. The study reported that fewer therapy sessions were needed to achieve the treatment goals for the EPG therapy and frication display method (N = 2), followed by EPG therapy (N = 2) and "standard treatment" (N = 2).
Eleven studies with a total of 941 participants were found to have evaluated brief psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals exposed to a specific traumatic event, examining a heterogeneous range of interventions. Eight studies were entered into meta-analysis. There was no observable difference between treatment and control conditions on primary outcome measures for these interventions at initial outcome (k=5, n=479; RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17). There was a trend for increased self-report of PTSD symptoms at 3 to 6 month follow-up in those who received an intervention (k=4, n=292; SMD 0.23; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.46). Two studies compared a memory structuring intervention against supportive listening. There was no evidence supporting the efficacy of this intervention.
Eligible studies (167 patients) were identified. Only one outcome, the proportion of patients with EDSS improvement at 4 weeks, was common to three trials. Otherwise outcomes were too heterogeneous to pool. Only one trial employed an equivalence design, but all reported no statistically significant difference in outcomes between groups. Namely, there was no significant difference in the degree of recovery 4 weeks following treatment. No difference was found in subsequent relapse rate, disability, hospitalization, ambulation, bioavailability, or in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to methodological limitations, heterogeneous treatment regimens and limited data, formal conclusions about equivalence of oral and intravenous steroidscannot be made. Oral Megadose Corticosteroid Therapy of Acute Exacerbations of Multiple Sclerosis (OMEGA) trial, designed to address such limitations, is currently underway.
The review included 30 studies (10,873 participants) in adults and adolescents, and three studies (1,173 participants) in children. The overall risk of bias was low and data on serious adverse events were obtained from all studies.Six deaths occurred in 5,710 adults on regular salmeterol with inhaled corticosteroids, and five deaths in 5,163 adults on regular inhaled corticosteroids at the same dose. The difference was not statistically significant (Peto OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.32 to 3.47) and the absolute difference between groups in risk of death of any cause was 0.00005 (95% CI -0.002 to 0.002). No deaths were reported in 1,173 children, and no deaths were reported to be asthma-related.Non-fatal serious adverse events of any cause were reported in 134 adults on regular salmeterol with inhaled corticosteroids, compared to 103 adults on regular inhaled corticosteroids; again this was not a significant increase (Peto OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.52). The absolute difference in the risk of non-fatal serious adverse events was 0.003 (95% CI -0.002 to 0.009).There were three of 586 children with serious adverse events on regular salmeterol with inhaled corticosteroids, compared to four out of 587 on regular inhaled corticosteroids: there was no significant difference between treatments (Peto OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.17 to 3.31).Asthma-related serious adverse events were reported in 23 and 21 adults in each group respectively, a non-significant difference (Peto OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.73), and only one event was reported in children.
Two studies met the selection criteria. One trial reported insufficient details to assess the risk of bias; the other trial is ongoing.Of the completed trial, the analyses of 30 participants did not show a statistically significant difference between the simvastatin and the placebo arm in visual acuity at three months of treatment (decimal visual acuity 0.21+/- 0.56 in simvastatin and 0.19+/- 0.40 in placebo arm) or 45 days after the completion of treatment (decimal visual acuity 0.20+/- 0.50 in simvastatin and 0.19+/- 0.48 in placebo arm). The lens and retina status were unchanged during and after the treatment period for both groups.Of the ongoing trial, the preliminary analyses of 42 participants who completed 12 months follow-up did not show a statistically significant difference between the simvastatin and the placebo arm in visual acuity, drusen score or visual function (effect estimates and confidence intervals were not available). We contacted the investigators and will update the review as data become available.
We included 13 studies with a total of 445 participants. The quality of the trials was generally poor and no results could be pooled due to the treatments being so heterogeneous. Treatment with thalidomide showed a significant remission of skin lesions compared to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) (RR 2.43; 95% CI 1.28 to 4.59) (1 trial, 92 participants). Clofazimine treatment was superior to prednisolone (more treatment successes; RR 3.67; 95% CI 1.36 to 9.91) (1 trial, 24 participants), and thalidomide (fewer recurrences; RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.56) (1 trial, 72 participants). We did not find any significant benefit for intravenous betamethasone compared to dextrose (1 trial, 10 participants), pentoxifylline compared to thalidomide (1 trial, 44 participants), indomethacin compared to prednisolone, aspirin or chloroquine treatments (2 trials, 80 participants), or levamisole compared to placebo (1 trial, 12 participants). Mild to moderate adverse events were significantly lower in participants taking 100 mg thalidomide compared to 300 mg thalidomide daily (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93). Significantly more minor adverse events were reported in participants taking clofazimine compared with prednisolone (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.35). None of the studies assessed quality of life or economic outcomes.
Twenty studies (1150 women) were included. Women who had caesarean section performed under regional analgesia and had wound infiltration had a decrease in morphine consumption at 24 hours (SMD -1.70mg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75 to -0.94) compared to placebo.In women under general anaesthesia, with caesarean section wound infiltration and peritoneal spraying with local anaesthetic (one study, 100 participants), the need for opioid rescue was reduced (risk ratio (RR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69). The numerical pain score (0 to10) within the first hour was also reduced (mean difference (MD) -1.46; 95% CI -2.60 to -0.32).Women with regional analgesia who had local anaesthetic and non-steriodal anti-inflammatory cocktail wound infiltration consumed less morphine (one study, 60 participants; MD -7.40 mg; 95% CI -9.58 to -5.22) compared to local anaesthetic control.Women who had regional analgesia with abdominal nerves blocked had decreased opioid consumption (four studies, 175 participants; MD -25.80 mg; 95% CI -50.39 to -5.37).For the outcome of visual analogue scale 0 to 10 over 24 hours, no advantage was demonstrated in the single study of 50 participants who had wound infiltrated with a mixture of local analgesia and narcotics versus local analgesia.Addition of ketamine to the local analgesia in women who had regional analgesia does not confer any advantage.
No randomised or quasi-randomised trials were identified. In 30 articles anecdotal evidence was found on treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy. Only three of these articles contained more than 10 treated cases, with one providing sufficient details to calculate the primary and secondary outcome measures for this review.
Ten studies (845 patients) were included. Compared to ACEi and/or ARB plus placebo, non-selective aldosterone antagonists along with ACEi and/or ARB significantly reduced 24 hour proteinuria (7 studies, 372 patients; MD -0.80 g, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.38). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the end of treatment with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB. This did not translate into an improvement in glomerular filtration rate (5 studies, 306 patients; MD -0.70 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -4.73 to 3.34). There was a significant increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB (8 studies, 436 patients; RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.41). In two studies, the addition of selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi resulted in an additional reduction in 24 hour proteinuria but without any impact on BP and renal function. Data on cardiovascular outcomes, long-term renal outcomes and mortality were not available.
We identified three trials. One randomised 83 patients with emotional disturbance after stroke to fluoxetine or placebo. After correcting for differences in fatigue severity at baseline, there was no significant difference in fatigue between groups at follow up. The second trial randomised 31 women with subarachnoid haemorrhage to tirilazad or placebo, of whom 18 were available for follow up. There was no difference in fatigue between the two groups. The third trial investigated a chronic disease self-management programme in 1150 patients with chronic diseases, of whom 125 had had a stroke. There was no difference in fatigue at follow up between the treatment and control in the subgroup with stroke.
We included 13 trials (962 participants); the period of follow up in all included trials ranged from 10 to 30 days. None of the trials reported the pre-specified primary outcome death or dependency during the follow-up period. The outcome measure in all included trials was the improvement of neurological deficit after treatment; acanthopanax was associated with a significant increase in the number of participants whose neurological impairment improved (risk ratio (RR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.29). Two trials reported adverse events; five trials reported no adverse events.
We included one RCT with 34 participants who were randomly assigned to receive IVIg or placebo once daily in addition to azathioprine and prednisolone for remission maintenance. There were no significant differences between adjuvant IVIg and adjuvant placebo in mortality, serious adverse events, time to relapse, open-label rescue therapy, and infection rates. The fall in disease activity score, derived from patient-reported symptoms, was slightly greater in the IVIg group than in the placebo group at one month (MD 2.30; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 3.48, P &lt; 0.01) and three months (MD 1.80; 95% CI 0.35 to 3.25, P = 0.01). There was a significant increase in total adverse events in the IVIg group (relative risk (RR) 3.50; 95% CI 1.44 to 8.48, P &lt; 0.01).
There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis.Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia.With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo.Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.
We found no studies meeting our inclusion criteria.
Of 12 trials identified, five were eligible for inclusion (n = 507). Three included singleton gestations with preterm labor (PTL); one included singleton gestations with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM); and one included twin gestations without or with PTL.In the three trials of singleton gestations with PTL, 290 women were randomized; 147 to knowledge and 143 to no knowledge of TVU CL. Knowledge of TVU CL results was associated with a non-significant decrease in PTB at less than 37 weeks (22.3% versus 34.7%, respectively; risk ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.32). Delivery occurred at a later gestational age in the knowledge versus no knowlege groups (mean difference 0.64 weeks (CI 0.03 to 1.25)). All other outcomes for which there were available data (PTB at less than 34 or 28 weeks; birthweight less than 2500 grams; perinatal death; maternal hospitalization; tocolysis; and steroids for fetal lung maturity) were similar in the two groups.The trial of singleton gestations with PPROM (n = 92) evaluated as its primary outcome safety of TVU CL in this population, and not its effect on management. The incidence of maternal and neonatal infections was similar in the TVU CL and no TVU CL groups.In the trial of twin gestations with or without PTL (n = 125), PTB at less than 36, 34, or 30 weeks, gestational age at delivery, and other perinatal and maternal outcomes were similar in the TVU CL and the no TVU CL groups. Life table analysis revealed significantly less preterm birth at less than 35 weeks in the TVU CL group compared to the no TVU CL group (P = 0.02).
Identified were 1408 records, and eight trials with a total of 1181 participants were included in the review. Trials were conducted in higher income earning countries between 2002 and 2007. Sample sizes ranged between 40 and 230. The methodological quality of the studies was judged to be generally good, although allocation concealment was reported in only three of the eight studies. A meta-analysis including three studies did not show any significant effect on virological suppression below 500 HIV-RNA copies/mL at one year (RR 1.28; [0.86, 1.92] chi(2) = 11.55 (P = 0.003), I(2) = 83%). Two trials including participants predominantly treated with unboosted PI-based regimens reported a 49% increased likelihood of achieving a HIV-RNA viral load below 500 copies/mL at 52 weeks (RR 1.49 [1.20, 1.83] chi(2) = 0.69 (P = 0.4), I(2) = 0%). Safety outcomes were reported in four studies and were similar between TDM and standard of care. Uptake of expert advice based on TDM results was good in two trials (&gt;70%), but low (&lt;35%) in the remaining three studies that reported uptake of the recommendations.
A total of 13933 cancer patients from 53 trials were analyzed, 1530 patients died on-study and 4993 overall. ESAs increased on study mortality (combined hazard ratio [cHR] 1.17; 95% CI 1.06-1.30) and worsened overall survival (cHR 1.06; 95% CI 1.00-1.12), with little heterogeneity between trials (I(2) 0%, p=0.87 and I(2) 7.1%, p=0.33, respectively). Thirty-eight trials enrolled 10441 patients receiving chemotherapy. The cHR for on study mortality was 1.10 (95% CI 0.98-1.24) and 1.04; 95% CI 0.97-1.11) for overall survival. There was little evidence for a difference between trials of patients receiving different cancer treatments (P for interaction=0.42).
Three trials were included, all of which evaluated doxycyline use. Trial quality suffered from a lack of intention-to-treat analysis and variability across trials in methodology and targeted outcomes. One trial assessed post-exposure prophylaxis in an indigenous population after a flood without apparent efficacy in reduction of clinical or laboratory identified Leptospira infection. Two trials assessed pre-exposure prophylaxis, one among deployed soldiers and another in an indigenous population. Despite an odds ratio of 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.36) for laboratory-identified infection among deployed soldiers on doxycyline in one of these two trials, pooled data showed no statistically significant reduction in Leptospira infection among participants (Odds ratio 0.28 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.48). Minor adverse events (predominantly nausea and vomiting) were more common among those on doxycycline with an odds ratio of 11 (95% CI 2.1 to 60).
Seven studies, including 2 cohort and 5 case-control studies, of 659,675 participants were included. We did not undertake a meta-analysis due to considerable methodological heterogeneity. The available data was limited and mainly on orofacial cleft. Most studies did not find significant associations between topical corticosteroids and pregnancy outcomes including mode of delivery, congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. One study found a significant association between first trimester topical corticosteroid use and orofacial cleft, and another found a significant association between very potent topical corticosteroids and low birthweight. Nevertheless, all the studies had drawbacks, and the quality of evidence was low to very low.
Nine studies (1459 participants) compared etodolac and placebo. Studies were of adequate reporting quality, and the majority of participants had pain following dental extractions. The dose of etodolac used was 25 mg to 1200 mg, with most of the information for 100 mg and 200 mg. For at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours compared with placebo the NNT for etodolac 100 mg (498 participants) was 4.8 (3.5 to 7.8) and for etodolac 200 mg (670 participants) it was 3.3 (2.7 to 4.2). Very limited information with the extended release formulation did not suggest improved benefit for this outcome.The proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 41% with 100 mg and 44% with 200 mg. Remedication was needed by about 60% with etodolac 200 mg or 400 mg over 6 to 8 hours, compared with almost 80% with placebo.Adverse events were uncommon, and not significantly different form placebo.
Eleven studies compared flurbiprofen (699 participants) with placebo (362 participants) in studies lasting 6 to 12 hours. Studies were of adequate reporting quality, and most participants had pain following dental extractions.The dose of flurbiprofen used was 25 mg to 100 mg, with most information for 50 mg and 100 mg. The NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours for flurbiprofen 50 mg compared with placebo (692 participants) was 2.7 (2.3 to 3.3) and for 100 mg (416 participants) it was 2.5 (2.0 to 3.1). With flurbiprofen 50 mg and 100 mg 65% to 70% of participants experienced at least 50% pain relief, compared with 25% to 30% with placebo. Rescue medication was used by 25% and 16% of participants with flurbiprofen 50 mg and 100 mg over 6 hours, compared with almost 70% with placebo.Adverse events were uncommon, and not significantly different from placebo.
The search strategy identified 793 citations. Twenty-three citations were deemed relevant for full text review; an additional ten articles were retrieved through hand searching references, for a total of thirty-three articles. Following full text review no articles met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were therefore not possible.
Four trials met the inclusion criteria; the total number of participants was 2204. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs of varying types and doses were not effective for reducing pain during IUD insertion. Misoprostol for cervical ripening did not reduce pain with IUD insertion in nulliparous women. Two trials evaluated pain that occurs after IUD insertion using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In one trial, naproxen taken prior to IUD insertion was effective in reducing pain compared with placebo in the first two hours after IUD insertion in mostly nulliparous women. However, this trial utilized the Dalkon Shield, an IUD with a wider diameter than modern IUDs. In another trial, ibuprofen 600 mg taken before IUD insertion did not show evidence of an effect on pain four to six hours after IUD insertion.
Six placebo and one active controlled studies (560 and 137 participants) in acute pain, and seven placebo and two active controlled studies (489 and 90 participants) in chronic pain were included. All used topical salicylates. The evidence in acute conditions was not robust; using only better quality, valid studies, there was no difference between topical rubefacient and topical control, though overall, including lower quality studies, the NNT for clinical success compared with placebo was 3.2 (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.9). In chronic conditions the NNT was 6.2 (95% CI: 4.0 to 13) compared with topical placebo. Adverse events and withdrawals occurred more often with rubefacients than placebo, but analyses were sensitive to inclusion of individual studies, so not robust. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions against active controls.
No included studies were identified after examining in detail thirteen studies on oral nefopam in participants with established postoperative pain.
Three trials (involving 852 women) evaluating the effects of IAP versus no treatment were included. The risk of bias was high. The use of IAP did not significantly reduce the incidence of all cause mortality, mortality from GBS infection or from infections caused by bacteria other than GBS. The incidence of early GBS infection was reduced with IAP compared to no treatment (risk ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.74, three trials, 488 infants; risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; number needed to treat to benefit 25, 95% CI 14 to 100, I(2) 0%). The incidence of LOD or sepsis from organisms other than GBS and puerperal infection was not significantly different between groups.One trial (involving 352 women) compared intrapartum ampicillin versus penicillin and reported no significant difference in neonatal or maternal outcomes.
Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. All five ACTs achieved PCR adjusted failure rates of &lt; 10%, in line with WHO recommendations, at most study sites.Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine performed well compared to the ACTs in current use (PCR adjusted treatment failure versus artesunate plus mefloquine in Asia; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.79; three trials, 1062 participants; versus artemether-lumefantrine in Africa; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.64; three trials, 1136 participants).ACTs were superior to amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in East Africa (PCR adjusted treatment failure versus artemether-lumefantrine; RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.24; two trials, 618 participants; versus AS+AQ; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; three trials, 1515 participants).Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.43; four trials, 1442 participants) and artesunate plus mefloquine (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.41; four trials, 1003 participants) were more effective than artemether-lumefantrine at reducing the incidence of P.vivax over 42 days follow up.
In the single included study, both S(+)-ibuprofen (dexibuprofen, an active isomer of ibuprofen) 200 mg and 400 mg gave high levels of response, with 31/51 (61%) and 35/50 (70%) respectively having at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, compared with 2/25 (8%) with placebo. The median time to additional analgesic use was 5.8 hours, 6.1 hours, and 1.8 hours respectively. The numbers of participants was too small to calculate NNTs with any meaning.
Only one trial fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This trial randomized 30 patients to methotrexate and 37 to placebo. Methotrexate was given orally in a dose of 12.5 mg/week. Fourteen patients in the methotrexate group and 18 patients in the placebo group who entered remission were followed for 9 months or to the time of first relapse. Sixty-four per cent of methotrexate patients relapsed compared to 44% of placebo patients (OR 2.25; 95% CI 0.54 to 9.45; P = 0.27).
Searches identified only one study (217 participants total), which used oral aceclofenac 150 mg in patients with established postoperative pain. Aceclofenac 150 mg could not be distinguished from placebo, though ibuprofen 400 mg was distinguished from placebo.
No study fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Not one of sixteen studies identified by the searches and examined in detail studied oral tenoxicam in patients with established postoperative pain and therefore no results are available.
We detected four eligible trials. Two trials compared lower vs. higher rates of glucose infusion in the early postnatal period. These trials were too small to assess effects on mortality or major morbidities. Two trials, one a moderately large multicentre trial (NIRTURE, Beardsall 2008), compared insulin infusion with standard care. Insulin infusion reduced hyperglycemia but increased death before 28 days and hypoglycemia. Reduction in hyperglycemia was not accompanied by significant effects on major morbidities; effects on neurodevelopment are awaited.
Eight studies comparing orlistat or sibutramine to placebo fulfilled our inclusion criteria. No relevant studies investigating rimonabant for weight loss were identified. No study included mortality and cardiovascular morbidity as a pre-defined outcome. Incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher in orlistat treated vs. placebo treated patients. Most frequent side effects with sibutramine were dry mouth, constipation and headache. Patients assigned to weight loss diets, orlistat or sibutramine reduced their body weight more effectively than patients in the usual care/placebo groups. Blood pressure reduction in patients treated with orlistat was for systolic blood pressure (SBP): weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.9 mm Hg and for diastolic blood pressure (DBP): WMD -1.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.0 to -0.9 mm Hg. Meta-analysis showed DBP increase under therapy with sibutramine: WMD +3.2 mm Hg; 95%CI +1.4 to +4.9 mm Hg.
Four trials involving 334 participants were included. Results showed pentoxifylline had no significant effect on reduction in pain (one RCT, MD -1.60, 95% CI -3.32 to 0.12). There was no evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancy events in the pentoxifylline group compared with placebo (three RCTs, OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.89 to 266). For recurrence of endometriosis, one RCT reported an OR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.27 to 2.84). No trials reported the effects of pentoxifylline on the odds of live birth rate per woman, improvement of endometriosis-related symptoms, or adverse events.
We did not identify any studies which met our full inclusion criteria.
We retrieved 128 references to studies, none of which matched the inclusion criteria for this review and all of which were excluded.
Ten RCT were identified that met the eligibility criteria. HAI regimens were based on floxuridine (FUDR), 5-fluorouracil or either one of these two fluoropyrimidines in eight and one RCT, respectively. SCT consisted of FUDR or 5-fluorouracil in three and seven RCT, respectively. By pooling the summary data, tumor response rate resulted 42.9% and 18.4% for HAI and SCT, respectively (RR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.80 to 2.84; P &lt; 0.0001). Mean weighted median OS times were 15.9 and 12.4 months for HAI and SCT, respectively: the meta-risk of death was not statistically different between the two treatment groups (HR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.07; P = 0.24).
Combining the results of the five included RCTs demonstrated a small treatment effect for pain, but no benefit in terms of improved self-reported physical function. Only one of these five RCTs exclusively recruited people with symptomatic hip OA.
No studies (RCTs or quasi RCTs) met the inclusion criteria.
A total of 25 trials representing 31 control-intervention comparisons were included in the review randomising 5572 children. Most of the participants were inadequately controlled on current ICS dose. We assessed the addition of LABA to the same dose of ICS and to an increased dose of ICS:(1) The addition of LABA to ICS was compared to same dose ICS, namely 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or less in 16 of the 24 studies. The mean age of participants was 10 years and males accounted for 64% of the study populations. The mean FEV(1) at baseline was 80% of predicted or above in 10 studies; FEV(1) 61% to 79% of predicted in eight studies; and unreported in the remaining study. Participants were inadequately controlled before randomisation in all but seven studies. Compared to ICS alone, the addition of LABA to ICS was not associated with a significant reduction in exacerbations requiring oral steroids (seven studies, RR 0.92 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40). Compared to ICS alone, there was a significantly greater improvement in FEV1 with the addition of LABA (nine studies; 0.08 Litres, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.11) but no statistically significant group differences in symptom-free days, hospital admission, quality of life, use of reliever medication, and adverse events. Withdrawals occurred significantly less frequently with the addition of LABA.(2) A total of seven studies assessed the addition of LABA to ICS therapy compared with an increased dose of ICS randomising 1021 children. The mean age of participants was 8 years with 67% of males. The baseline mean FEV(1) was 80% of predicted or above in 2 of the 3 studies reporting this characteristic. All trials enrolled participants who were inadequately controlled on a baseline dose equivalent to 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or less. There was no group significant difference in the risk of an exacerbation requiring oral steroids with the combination of LABA and ICS compared to a double dose of ICS (two studies, RR 1.5 95% CI 0.65 to 3.48). The increased risk of hospital admission with combination therapy was also not statistically significant (RR 2.21 95% CI 0.74 to 6.64). Compared to double dose ICS, use of LABA was associated with a significantly greater improvement in morning PEF (four studies; MD 7.55 L/min 95% CI: 3.57 to 11.53) and evening PEF L/min (three studies, MD 5.5 L/min; 95% CI 1.21 to 9.79), but there were insufficient data to aggregate data on FEV(1), symptoms, rescue reliever use, and quality of life. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall risk of all cause withdrawals (five studies; RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.20. There was no group difference in the risk of overall adverse effects detected. Short term growth was significantly greater in children treated with combination therapy compared to double dose ICS (two studies: MD 1.2 cm/year; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.7).
There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6-8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo. For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43.. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively) . The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs.
PostalWe found 481 eligible trials. The trials evaluated 110 different ways of increasing response to postal questionnaires. We found substantial heterogeneity among trial results in half of the strategies. The odds of response were at least doubled using monetary incentives (odds ratio 1.87; 95% CI 1.73 to 2.04; heterogeneity P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 84%), recorded delivery (1.76; 95% CI 1.43 to 2.18; P = 0.0001, I(2) = 71%), a teaser on the envelope - e.g. a comment suggesting to participants that they may benefit if they open it (3.08; 95% CI 1.27 to 7.44) and a more interesting questionnaire topic (2.00; 95% CI 1.32 to 3.04; P = 0.06, I(2) = 80%). The odds of response were substantially higher with pre-notification (1.45; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.63; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 89%), follow-up contact (1.35; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.55; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 76%), unconditional incentives (1.61; 1.36 to 1.89; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 88%), shorter questionnaires (1.64; 95% CI 1.43 to 1.87; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 91%), providing a second copy of the questionnaire at follow up (1.46; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.90; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 82%), mentioning an obligation to respond (1.61; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.22; P = 0.98, I(2) = 0%) and university sponsorship (1.32; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.54; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 83%). The odds of response were also increased with non-monetary incentives (1.15; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.22; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 79%), personalised questionnaires (1.14; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 63%), use of hand-written addresses (1.25; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45; P = 0.32, I(2) = 14%), use of stamped return envelopes as opposed to franked return envelopes (1.24; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.35; P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 69%), an assurance of confidentiality (1.33; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.42) and first class outward mailing (1.11; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21; P = 0.78, I(2) = 0%). The odds of response were reduced when the questionnaire included questions of a sensitive nature (0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00; P = 0.51, I(2) = 0%).ElectronicWe found 32 eligible trials. The trials evaluated 27 different ways of increasing response to electronic questionnaires. We found substantial heterogeneity among trial results in half of the strategies. The odds of response were increased by more than a half using non-monetary incentives (1.72; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.72; heterogeneity P &lt; 0.00001, I(2) = 95%), shorter e-questionnaires (1.73; 1.40 to 2.13; P = 0.08, I(2) = 68%), including a statement that others had responded (1.52; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.70), and a more interesting topic (1.85; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.26). The odds of response increased by a third using a lottery with immediate notification of results (1.37; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.65), an offer of survey results (1.36; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.61), and using a white background (1.31; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.56). The odds of response were also increased with personalised e-questionnaires (1.24; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.32; P = 0.07, I(2) = 41%), using a simple header (1.23; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48), using textual representation of response categories (1.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36), and giving a deadline (1.18; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.34). The odds of response tripled when a picture was included in an e-mail (3.05; 95% CI 1.84 to 5.06; P = 0.27, I(2) = 19%). The odds of response were reduced when "Survey" was mentioned in the e-mail subject line (0.81; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97; P = 0.33, I(2) = 0%), and when the e-mail included a male signature (0.55; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.80; P = 0.96, I(2) = 0%).
At 6 months, mean weight loss was 12.6 +/- 8.3 kg, 63 individuals had &gt; or = 10 % baseline weight loss; no severe morbidity was detected. During the first and second years following intragastric balloon removal, mean body mass increased by 4.2 +/- 6.8 and 2.3 +/- 6.0 kg, respectively ( P &lt; 0.001 for both year-on-year comparisons). At 2.5 years, intragastric balloon therapy had been successful in 24 participants. At final follow-up (4.8 +/- 1.6 years), 28 had &gt; or = 10 % baseline weight loss, 35 had undergone bariatric surgery (60 % had preoperative mass higher than baseline), and 3 were lost to follow-up; the 34 remaining had lost 1.5 +/- 5.8 kg compared with baseline. During follow-up, 13 had a second intragastric balloon implanted and 13 took sibutramine for short periods.
The procedure was successfully completed in 868 patients from group V (93.3 %) and 931 patients from group S (99.7 %; P &lt; 0.001). Patients and endoscopists reported a higher degree of satisfaction in group S than group V ( P &lt; 0.0001). Procedural pain score in group S was significantly lower than in group V ( P &lt; 0.0001). The endoscopist rated patients in group S as having better tolerance and ease of intubation than those in group V ( P = 0.0004 and P = 0.002, respectively). Adverse events occurred in 370 patients in group V and 316 patients in group S ( P = 0.002). These were mainly transient changes in vital signs including hypertension, tachycardia, and bradycardia.
193 patients (119 men, mean age 61.6 +/- 16.2) first underwent capsule endoscopy and then DBE. The most frequent positive findings at capsule endoscopy were vascular lesions (74 patients, 38.3 %), blood or clot in the lumen (34, 17.6 %), and tumor mass (20, 10.4 %). The most frequent findings at DBE were vascular lesions (72 patients, 37.3 %), neoplasia (30, 15.5 %) and ulcers/inflammatory lesions (12, 6.2 %). Overall kappa coefficient was 0.46 (95 %CI 0.38 - 0.54), with maximum concordance for vascular (0.72 [95 %CI 0.59 - 0.84]) and inflammatory (0.78 [0.58 - 0.99]) lesions and minimum for polyps (0.46 [0.16 - 0.80]). Blood in the lumen was the only positive finding at capsule endoscopy in 34 cases; of these, 12 had negative DBE findings whereas 10 had vascular lesions, 6 neoplasia, 1 ulcer, and 5 diverticula.
189 EUS-CPB and 31 EUS-CPN procedures were done in 128 and 30 patients, respectively (60 men, 98 women). Indications for blockades included chronic pancreatitis (122), relapsing pancreatitis with chronic pain (28), upper abdominal pain of suspected pancreatic origin (37), and suspected (yet unproven) pancreatic cancer with pain (2). Neurolyses were performed for refractory pain from cancer (21) or chronic pancreatitis (10). No prophylactic antibiotics were administered. Acid suppression was not withheld. Complications were defined as procedural side effects treated with anything beyond standard observation. Four complications were observed during clinical follow-up (three after CPB, one after CPN), giving an overall complication rate of 1.8 % (CPB 1.6 %, CPN 3.2 %). Complications included asymptomatic hypotension after neurolysis, retroperitoneal abscess after CPB, and severe self-limited postprocedural pain in two patients after CPB.
Injection of 5 mL, 2 mL and 1 mL of hot saline produced localized necrosis (7 - 10 mm) of pancreatic tissue in the acute study. However, there was pooling of hot saline on the surface of the pancreas when 5mL was injected. On the basis of the results of the acute study, the volume of hot saline injected in the survival study was 1 mL. One milliliter of hot saline produced localized or sporadic necrosis of pancreatic tissue without any signs of pancreatitis in all three pigs in the survival study; hot saline was observed to pool on the pancreatic surface of one pig. There was no histological evidence of necrosis in the pancreatic tissue adjacent to the pooled hot saline in either the acute or the survival study.
During the first 5 years, the mean costs per procedure were Euro 4.78 for handwritten, Euro 6.39 for dictated and Euro 8.90 for computerized reports. Due to depreciation, after this initial period, the respective costs declined to Euro 4.37, Euro 5.20 and Euro 5.13, respectively. Despite high initial costs, a cost-benefit analysis already revealed a financial benefit from a computerized system after 3 years.
The global Moran's I value is 0.2673 (p = 0.001), indicating an overall positive spatial correlation of CIHD SMR and AOD. The entire study area is dominated by spatial clusters of AOD against SMR (high AOD and high SMR in the east, and low AOD and low SMR in the west) (permutations = 999, p = 0.05). Of the three regression models, the spatial error model achieved the best fit (R2 = 0.28). The effect of AOD is positive and significant (beta = 0.7774, p = 0.01).
Twelve defects were gunshot wounds, 12 free latissimus dorsi flaps, and no flap losses. Patients received psychiatric treatment after 22 days (7-29); the tracheotomy was removed in 10 patients with normal alimentation in all cases. Mean hospitalization duration was 21 days.
Patients showed an impaired postural control compared with controls. Patients with Child C cirrhosis had lower scores in the posturography than those with Child A or B cirrhosis. Patients with alcohol-induced (AIC) Child B cirrhosis achieved lower scores in the posturography than those with non-alcohol-induced (NAIC) Child B cirrhosis. Patients with AIC Child C had lower scores than the corresponding NAIC patients, although this did not reach statistical significance. In the NAIC group Child C patients, in the AIC group Child B and C patients had lower scores than the controls. Patients with abnormal results in the number connection tests, as well as those with high NH3 and pNH3 levels showed worse postural control than those with normal results.
Sixty-nine patients, with an average age of 65.8 years (range 29-87), were followed up for a median of 5 years and 10 months (range 7-109). In 57 patients (83%), the anaemia resolved after the initial treatment period. Fifteen patients (22%) died during the follow-up period, two from a GI cancer and 13 from non-GI-related causes. Six patients (9%) developed persistent anaemia severe enough to require recurrent blood or iron transfusions. Seventeen patients (25%) had a transient recurrent anaemia and four (6%) were diagnosed with GI malignancies during the follow-up.
Two hundred and fifty-five cases were identified with a mean age of 62 years and a median Rockall score of 3. Eighty-two percent of gastroscopies were performed within 24 h. Of these, 29% were undertaken after 5 p.m. Peptic ulcer and varices (15%) were the commonest diagnosis. The rebleeding (12%) and mortality rate (9%) were comparable with that of the units previous audit (P=0.47, 0.51, respectively) and the current national audit (P=0.58, 0.76, respectively). The number of patients requiring surgery has reduced from 6 to 0.4% in our unit over the last 8 years. Preendoscopy and postendoscopy Rockall scores were predictive of rebleeding (P=0.013, 0.045) and mortality (P=0.003, 0.01).
Surveys were answered by 197 GIE units (65%), which had performed 588,326 endoscopies over the past 12 months. Sedation was used in more than 20% of gastroscopies performed at 55% of the GIE units, and more than 20% of colonoscopies were sedated at 71% of the units; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is almost always performed under sedation. The most common drugs were midazolam for gastroscopy and midazolam and pethidine for colonoscopy and ERCP; propofol is used by anesthetists; pulse oximetry is used at 77% of GIE units; 42% of the GIE units fill in a nursing record; 52% of GIE units have recovery rooms and 91% have a cardiac arrest trolley.
HCV could have caused around 70% of HCC deaths and 50% of cirrhosis mortality in Spain in 2000 (60% HCC, 40% cirrhosis with HCV lower estimate). For HBV these proportions are 10 and 13%, respectively. We estimated 4342 HCV-related deaths and 877 HBV-related deaths in Spain in 2000, globally 1.5% of total deaths in Spain that year. Mortality by cirrhosis and HCC represented most of these viral-related deaths. Attributable mortality in AIDS patients was also estimated.
Of the 18,414 patients who underwent EGD, 81 (0.44%) were found to have gastric cancer. Incidence of gastric cancer in repeated screening group was lower than that of infrequent screening group (multiple adjusted odds ratio=0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.77, P=0.004). The proportion of EGCs was 96% (25 of 26) n the repeated screening group and 71% (34 of 48) in the infrequent screening group (P=0.01). Mean (SD) tumor size was smaller [1.9 (1.2) vs. 3.0 (1.6) cm, P=0.01] and the proportion of intramucosal cancer was higher [81% (21 of 26) vs. 50% (24 of 48), P=0.02] in the former than in the latter. Endoscopic resection was performed more frequently in the repeated screening group [54% (14 of 26) vs. 23% (11 of 48), P=0.007].
Serum markers of liver damage increased by CCl4 intoxication (P&lt;0.05), whereas cotreatment with NAC prevented these increases (P&lt;0.05); glycogen was depleted in the cirrhotic group (P&lt;0.05), but preserved by NAC (P&lt;0.05). Lipid peroxidation increased and glutathione decreased by the administration of CCl4 (P&lt;0.05), again NAC prevented both effects (P&lt;0.05). Importantly, collagen increased by about seven-fold in the CCl4 group (P&lt;0.05); administration of NAC preserved the normal levels of collagen (P&lt;0.05). Biochemical determinations were corroborated by hematoxylin and eosin, and trichromic stains. Western blots revealed a four-fold increase in TGF-beta in the group receiving CCl4, NAC cotreatment abolished TGF-beta signal (P&lt;0.05).
Six hundred and twenty-eight (70.5%) out of 891 patients with hepatitis C had hyperlipidemia. Of the 628 patients who had hyperlipidemia, 81 (12.7%) had positive antibody and RNA not tested; 162 (25.4%) had positive antibody but negative RNA testing; and 385 (61.3%) had positive testing for viral RNA. Two hundred and eighty-four (45.2%) of 628 patients with hyperlipidemia were eligible for treatment to lower it. Of 146 patients with hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus or arterial disease who were qualified for treatment (LDL &gt;99), 95 (65.1%) were treated with lipid-lowering medication. Of 148 patients with hyperlipidemia and without diabetes or arterial disease who were qualified for treatment, 64 (43.3%) were treated with lipid-lowering medication.
We identified eight variants among this sample. Three were synonymous and c.180 C&gt;T was significantly enriched in patients (odds ratio=2.09; 95% confidence interval=1.19-3.67; P=0.03). We identified a novel nonsynonymous CTRC (p.G61R) variant in one of 146 patients (0.7%), but absent from controls. In-silico analysis showed that this variant affected a conserved residue, and functional analysis showed that p.G61R results in a complete loss of CTRC secretion from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells. SPINK1 p.N34S was present in 31.8% of patients compared with 4.7% in controls, there was no significant cosegregation with CTRC variants.
In livers with ALF or undergoing warm hepatic I/R, injury was quantified by intravital fluorescence microscopy, chemical, and immunohistochemical analysis as well as western immunoblot. Induction of both ALF and I/R injury led to hepatocellular expression of c-mpl, the receptor of TPO. Exogenous application of recombinant TPO in a low (12.5 microg/kg) as well as a high (75 microg/kg) dose, however, did not ameliorate postischemic perfusion and leukocyte endothelial cell interaction, but slightly aggravated transaminase release upon I/R. Similarly, TPO was unable to dampen hepatic microcirculatory deteriorations after the induction of ALF, but caused an increase of leukocyte accumulation and transaminase activity when applied in high dose. Low dose of TPO did not influence the amount of hepatocellular apoptosis, whereas high-dose TPO slightly diminished the activation of caspase 3. Interestingly, exogenous TPO application completely reversed the stress-induced increase of plasma IL-6 levels, suggesting a negative feedback of TPO on IL-6 release.
Enteroclysis was unsuccessful in two patients from group 1 8 and six patients from group 2, respectively. In group 1, abnormal findings consistent with CD were detected in 20 patients by using WCE and in 11 patients by using enteroclysis, out of the total 27, at per-protocol analysis (74.1 vs. 40.7%, P&lt;0.05). Of the 11 patients who had ileal CD on enteroclysis, three had more extensive small-bowel disease, which was detected only by WCE. In group 2, WCE showed findings consistent with CD in 13 of 20 patients, in contrast with enteroclysis, which was positive for CD in only six of 20 patients (65 vs. 30%, P&lt;0.05). Three more patients had findings compatible with CD on WCE, but they failed their enteroclysis. Overall, a new diagnosis of CD was made in 16 patients.
A higher proportion of T2D patients were heterozygous at SNP rs2267161 with both T (methionine) and C (valine) alleles present (49.8% versus 41.3%, P = .04). The calculated odd risk for T2D was 1.47 (1.01-2.15, P = .047). Among female controls, the homozygous CC individuals displayed lower insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR (P = .05) than the C/T or TT persons; this was particularly prevalent in individuals who exercise (P = .03).
The study group was in mild dehydration. As a significant difference was found in ANP levels between children in the 3mo-3y group and older children 3y-14y. We analyzed the results according to age. No difference was found between children with AGE and control, in the 3mo-3y, ANP was 12.1 +/- 11 pg/ml versus 13.4 +/- 12 pg/ml respectively, and 3 +/- 2 versus 3.8 +/- 3 pg/ml in the 3y-14y groups, respectively.
The overall prevalence of khat chewing in all the studied population was 21.4% (colleges 15.2% versus schools 21.5%). There were 3.8% female khat chewers and 37.70% male Khat chewers. Significant differences were found between khat chewers according to age, gender and residence (p &lt; 0.05). The prevalence was different in different colleges and in different provinces of Jazan region.
Dyspnoea was the only symptom or sign with high sensitivity (89%), but it had poor specificity (51%). Clinical features with relatively high specificity included history of myocardial infarction (89%), orthopnoea (89%), oedema (72%), elevated jugular venous pressure (70%), cardiomegaly (85%), added heart sounds (99%), lung crepitations (81%) and hepatomegaly (97%). However, the sensitivity of these features was low, ranging from 11% (added heart sounds) to 53% (oedema). Electrocardiography (ECG), B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) all had high sensitivities (89%, 93% and 93% respectively). Chest X-ray was moderately specific (76-83%) but insensitive (67-68%). BNP was more accurate than ECG, with a relative diagnostic odds ratio of ECG/BNP of 0.32 (95% CI 0.12-0.87). There was no difference between the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT-proBNP. A model based upon simple clinical features and BNP derived from one data set was found to have good validity when applied to other data sets. A model substituting ECG for BNP was less predictive. From this a simple clinical rule was developed: in a patient presenting with symptoms such as breathlessness in whom heart failure is suspected, refer directly to echocardiography if the patient has a history of myocardial infarction or basal crepitations or is a male with ankle oedema; otherwise, carry out a BNP test and refer for echocardiography depending on the results of the test. On the basis of the cost-effectiveness analysis carried out, such a decision rule is likely to be considered cost-effective to the NHS in terms of cost per additional case detected. The cost-effectiveness analysis further suggested that, if likely benefit to the patient in terms of improved life expectancy is taken into account, the optimum strategy would be to refer all patients with symptoms suggestive of heart failure directly for echocardiography.
Active social participation and easy access to help from others were associated with good self-rated health, especially in the urban and sparsely populated rural areas. Trust was a particularly important correlate of subjective health in the urban area, though its significance diminished after adjusting to all background variables. No overall disparities in self-rated health between the areas emerged. Social participation and access to help as indicators of social capital seem to be important resources when aging men and women assess their subjective health.
Unlike previous studies, we found that a four-factor solution splitting cons into esthetic and health cons significantly improved the fit of model to the data. ME/I testing showed that the same structure and measurement model held for both smokers and nonsmokers, girls and boys, and across the three occasions the scale was administered.
The prevalence of Type D personality was 22.4%. The two-factor structure and the validity of the DS14 were confirmed. The DS14 subscales were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86/0.71; mean inter-item correlation = 0.48/0.27) and stable over a 4-week period (r = 0.85/0.63). Type D individuals had significantly higher mean scores on anxiety (p &lt; 0.001), depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), and negative affect (p &lt; 0.001), and lower scores on positive affect (p &lt; 0.001) compared to non-Type D individuals.
The scale was demonstrated to be unifactorial and internally reliable and to show the expected relationships with several measures of socioeconomic position, physical health, and mental health.
Exploratory factor analysis revealed a similar factor structure as the original English version and similar problems with items 13 (compassion) and 14 (mercy). After carefully deliberating on the Chinese conceptualization of spirituality and balancing psychometric properties, the one-factor 16-item structure of the English version was supported. DSES-C showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.97). Construct validity was supported by correlations with validation scales in expected directions.
The minimum average partial method suggested a three-factor solution. The three factors were named (1) health anxiety, (2) health behavior, and (3) health habits. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for the three scales were (1) alpha = 0.88, (2) alpha = 0.75, and (3) alpha = 0.56.
The first study showed that the content and formulation of the French BIAQ items were adequate for children and adolescents. The following three studies provided support for the factor validity, measurement invariance (across sex), reliability, and convergent validity of the French BIAQ. Regarding the measurement invariance tests, the results revealed that the models were invariant up to the levels of the latent means structures. Post hoc probing of these differences showed a significant higher latent mean score of the global BIAQ scale in females (in samples 2 and 3).
The two-factor structure of the DS14 was confirmed; the subscales negative affectivity and social inhibition were shown to be valid, internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87/0.91; mean inter-item correlations = 0.49/0.59), and stable over 3 and 12 weeks (r = 0.85/0.78; 0.83/0.79; ps &lt; 0.01). Type D was an independent associate of anxiety (beta, 0.49; p &lt; 0.01) and depression (beta, 0.47; p &lt; 0.01) in univariable linear regression analysis and remained a significant independent associate of anxiety (beta, 0.26; p &lt; 0.01) and depression (beta, 0.17; p &lt; 0.01) in adjusted analyses.
Presence and severity of clinically significant depressive symptomatology were associated with cervical neoplasia. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that women with greater depressive symptoms had marginally greater odds of presenting with cervical neoplasia (BDI: OR = 1.16, p = 0.092; CES-D: OR = 1.15, p = 0.067. Women with greater somatic depressive symptoms, specifically, had significantly greater odds of presenting with cervical neoplasia (BDI: OR = 1.86, p = 0.027; CES-D: OR = 1.56, p = 0.017).
The Portuguese version of WHOQOL-100 showed acceptable internal consistency (alpha range 0.84-0.94) and test-retest reliability in all domains (r range 0.67-0.86). Discriminant validity was significant for all domains, except in Spirituality. Convergent validity with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory was satisfactory for most domains.
More than 70% of the participants scored positively for the items concerning non-tobacco use, limiting alcohol consumption, non-drug use, washing hands before eating, and were abstinent or had used a condom at last sex, while fewer than 50% fulfilled criteria for washing hands with soap, never bullied in the past 30 days, no passive smoking, condom use at last sex, physically active for at least 60 min per day for 3 days in a week, and walk or bike to school. Multiple logistic regression identified school attendance, parental or guardian connectedness, peer support at school, and parental supervision are important for adolescent health in this sample.
On average, 36% to 39% of the total tested items appeared to be cross-language DIF items in the statistical analyses. The judgmental review indicated that half of the DIF items may be associated with translation difference. The impacts of the DIF items on the mean comparisons of the JCQ scales between the centers were non-trivial: underestimated skill discretion (Milan), underestimated decision authority (Leiden), underestimated psychological demands (Milan women), and incomparable coworker support (Gothenburg 95).
In both systems, the major von Mises stresses occurred with vertical loading on the mesial and the distal neck area of the first and third implants, respectively: 6.304 MPa on the first implant of the straight system and 6.173 MPa on the third implant in the angled system. The peak stress occurred for the minimum principal stress (S3) on the neck of the first implant for both systems at the level of -8.835 MPa for the straight system and -8.511 MPa for the angled system. There was no stress concentration on the inner or outer angles of the angled implants, on the notches along the implant body, or on any apex.
There was a significant difference in peak insertion torque between the self-tapping and self-drilling group (P&lt;.05), except when the average drilling force at host sites was less than 1.2 N (P&gt;.05). In addition, this experiment demonstrated that the lateral displacement of the self-tapping group was comparable to that of the self-drilling group (P&gt;.05).
Analysis of variance of the values obtained at the different stages showed significant differences (P&lt;.05) for the heart rate and for the duration of the RR and QT intervals. The heart rate increased during the anesthesia, incision, and bone drilling stages, reaching a peak during drilling. Duration of the RR and QT intervals decreased during the incision and drilling stages. Among the electrocardiographic parameters individually assessed, several altered values were found for the duration of the P wave, the QRS complex, and the QT and QTc intervals. Sinusal tachycardia and bradycardia, sinusal arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystole, ventricular extrasystole, and T-wave inversion were detected.
The machined surface showed a flat profile with isotropic grooves, the AE1 surface showed a uniformly microscale roughened surface, and the AE2 surface had a grooved profile with intermediate surface roughness. The AE2 surface contained fluoride atoms (2.45%+/-0.44% as F/Ti atomic ratio). Cell attachment was significantly weaker on the machined surface than on the AE1 and AE2 surfaces, whereas no differences were observed between the AE1 and AE2 surfaces. The cell counts on the machined and AE2 surfaces were higher, with a parallel orientation, whereas the cell count was lower and randomly distributed on the AE1 surface. The expression level of fibroblastic genes was similar among surfaces for all time points tested. Collagen production was highest on the machined surface, followed by AE2 and AE1 surfaces. Collagen deposition displayed a parallel pattern on the machined surface, while it was multidirectional on the AE1 and AE2 surfaces.
PRP accelerated the repair process for both BO and BG; however, the action of PRP associated with BO did not surpass that of BG alone.
There was a high level of agreement regarding the quality of strains, as determined by both techniques, although the mean values obtained with EV-SGA were higher than those found with NL-FEA. However, the strains recorded by NL-FEA did not differ significantly (P&lt;.05) from the strains recorded by EV-SGA.
The mean deviation of borehole apex positions in the slave phantoms, as compared to the master phantom, was 0.50+/-0.04 mm and was below 1 mm in 29 of 30 models. The accuracy was highly reproducible, irrespective of the template used and the surgeon involved.
The von Mises stress was highest in the 7-mm-long implant. Stresses in cortical and trabecular bone were reduced by at least 50% for all other implants (length greater than or equal to 8.5 mm) with bicortical anchorage. Increasing the length of the bicortically anchored implant did not decrease the stress in native bone, but it decreased the stress in sinus grafts by at least 20%. The use of a wide implant decreased the stress by 24% to 42% in cortical bone and 17% to 36% in trabecular bone. Increasing the elastic modulus of grafted bone decreased the stress in native bone by approximately 10%.
No statistically significant differences were found between the groups with or without perforations to the area of the graft (P=.85) or the percentage of hard tissue in the grafts (P=.53), the interface (P=.65), or the receptor bed (P=.18).
The highest percentage shortfall was 20.5% at a set torque of 11.4 Ncm (absolute deviation of -2.4 Ncm). The highest percentage by which a torque was exceeded was 54.6% (absolute deviation of 5.5 Ncm). The lowest value for absolute shortfall was found to be -5.6 Ncm at a set torque of 45 Ncm. The highest absolute exceeded was 15 Ncm at a set torque of 40 Ncm. Potentially problematic torque values were identified in the low-torque-value setting, as the implant position may be changed if a machine driver applies excessive torque to the first-stage healing screw. In addition, in the indication of immediate loading in the high-set-torque group, torque values above the critical value of 50 Ncm may be unwittingly applied while working with a set torque of 40 Ncm.
The mathematical calculations met the clinical requirements using a contact pressure of 2 3 108 Nm2 with a preload of 1.9 kN on cooled abutments. After recooling, the contact pressure was 1.3 Nm2, allowing for easy disassembly. Microbacterial analysis revealed no penetration of Escherichia coli under static conditions either in the control group or in the prototypes. Under dynamic conditions, however, the prototypes showed significantly reduced bacterial leakage compared to the controls.
The median increase (25th through 75th percentiles) of the local intraosseous temperature was 3.0 degrees C (2.2 degrees C to 4.2 degrees C) for the SurgySonic, 2.2 degrees C (1.8 degrees C to 3.2 degrees C) for the Piezosurgery II, and 1.1 degrees C (0.7 degrees C to 1.6 degrees C) for the Piezotome. The median cutting performance was 0.31 mm/s (0.11 to 0.46 mm/s) for the Piezotome, 0.25 mm/s (0.23 to 0.27 mm/s) for the Piezosurgery II, and 0.04 mm/s (0.03 to 0.05 mm/s) for the SurgySonic.
Thirty-one patients showed clinical signs of peri-implant mucositis and, in 25 implant sites, periodontal pathogens were found. Smoking showed a statistically significant correlation with clinical signs of peri-implant mucositis (univariate analysis). For periodontal pathogens at the implant site, the type of dentition was statistically significant. In the multivariate analysis of the clinical signs of peri-implant mucositis, smoking and radiation therapy were significant explanatory variables. Seventy-two percent of the patients showed agreement for finding either clinical signs of peri-implant mucositis and periodontal pathogens or for no clinical signs and no pathogens. The sensitivity for diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis was 45%, and the specificity was 84%.
All patients successfully adapted to the new VDO. Two patients in group B and four in group C reported tooth clenching or grinding, which abated after 2 to 3 months (P&lt;.05). More bone loss and tooth failures were observed in group A, and more mechanical complications, such as porcelain fractures, were observed in group C (P&lt;.05).
At membrane removal, mean vertical augmentation was 5.5 mm (+/-2.29 mm). Mean combined crestal remodeling was 1.01 mm (+/-0.57 mm) at 12 months, which remained stable through the 6-year follow-up period. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in mean marginal bone remodeling. One defect had a bone graft complication (2.78%, 95% CI: 0.00%, 8.15%). The overall implant survival rate was 100% with a cumulative success rate of 94.7%.
In the tilted model with 5-mm cantilever and in the nontilted model, the maximum value of compressive stress (-18 MPa) was found near the cervical area of the distal implant. Higher values for compressive stress were predicted near the cervical area of the distal implant in the tilted model with a 15-mm cantilever, as compared to the tilted model with the 5-mm cantilever. For the tilted model with the 5-mm cantilever, peak values of tensile stress were predicted near the cervical area of both the distal (1.25 MPa) and the mesial implants (2.5 MPa). For the nontilted model, the peak value was found near the cervical area of the in-between implant (5 MPa). For the tilted model with 15-mm cantilever, tensile stress values were higher than in the tilted model with 5-mm cantilever.
At the 3-month follow-up examination, 294 of 306 implants placed in 51 subjects were found to be integrated. This represents a cumulative implant survival rate of 96%. At the 1-year follow-up examination, mean marginal bone loss of 0.5 mm was noted, with no further loss of implants.
Sixty-nine patients with severely resorbed edentulous maxillae were included in the study. Four hundred and ninety implants (six to eight in each patient) were placed to support 69 fixed prostheses; 330 were in palatal positions and 160 were in molar positions (84 over the crest in the first molar position and 76 in anatomic buttresses). The success rate of palatally positioned implants was 97.8% (323/330). The mean bone loss of implants with palatal anchorage after 2 years of loading was 0.61 mm (range, 0 to 3.10 mm). All patients had stable prostheses at the end of the observation period. Patients were satisfied with comfort and stability, ability to speak, ease of cleaning, esthetics, and function of the prosthesis.
A total of 61 patients were treated between 1991 and April 2007 (n=134 implants). Three of these implants in three different patients failed during the observation period, demonstrating an estimated probability of functional implant survival of 97.6% (SE 1.4%) after 16 years. In patients who were seen during the clinical evaluation in 2004 (n=76 implants), only mild inflammation of the peri-implant mucosa was generally observed (Gingival-Bleeding Index=1), despite the fact that the level of oral hygiene was considered inadequate around 55 of 76 implants (72%). Obvious signs of drug-induced gingival hyperplasia in relation to the implants were not observed. Probing depths averaged approximately 2 mm. Stable marginal bone levels were observed on the radiographs.
Six (6) studies including a total of 537 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five (5) of them used acupuncture while another one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trials reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side-effects were not reported in any of the trials. Flaws in study design or reporting (particularly uncertain allocation concealment and substantial loss to follow-up) and clinical differences between trials prevented conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture.
A total of 12 ADRs to CAM were reported, which included 9 to Ayurvedic and 3 to homeopathic medicines, which accounted for 1.5% of the ADRs reported to the ADR reporting unit. ADR resulted in hospitalization in 5 patients. The system organ class most commonly involved included skin and appendage disorders (58.3%). Only four of the reactions were previously reported in the literature. The mean time for onset of the ADR after the administration of the drug was 27.8 +/- 36.1 days. The suspected drug was withdrawn in all the reports that resulted in recovery, with mean time for recovery 5.9 +/- 3.6 days. The majority (66.6%) were moderate in severity and 2 were severe in nature. On causality assessment, 6 were probable in nature and the remaining were possible.
For authors in the China group versus those outside the China group, the search results were 4790 versus 2609 citations and approximately 40,000 versus 20,000 MeSH terms, respectively. The threshold value of highly frequent terms was set at 30 versus 20, and the cumulative frequency percentage of these terms was 40.92% versus 36.67%, respectively. Thus, 43 highly frequent MeSH terms were identified and 43 x 43 co-word matrices were acquired for each group. The appearance frequency of MeSH showed that most research focused on pharmacology, therapeutic application, phytotherapy, side-effects of Chinese herbal drugs, and identification of active chemical components in herbs.
The clinical trial showed that application of IR can reduce the severity of radiation mucositis (p = 0.01), anorexia (p = 0.002), and swallowing difficulty (p = 0.002). Although patients' resting days did not show a significant difference (p = 0.06), complete radiotherapy was done without rest for 4 of 11 patients in the IR group versus 2 of 9 in controls. Hemoglobin level between both groups showed no significant difference. Serum interleukin-6 was significantly lower in the IR group during the first, fifth, and seventh weeks.
The MIC of RJ without starch was 1.7% (vol/vol) and 2% (vol/vol) against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. When starch was incubated with RJ and then added to media, a significant MIC drop has been noticed against both strains. This MIC drop was 61% and 30% against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively.
Slow breathing had a stronger effect than fast breathing. BP decreased longitudinally over a 3-month period with both interventions. S/L ratio, 30:15 ratio, E/I ratio, and BP response in the hand grip and cold pressor test showed significant change only in patients practicing the slow-breathing exercise.
Five hundred and seventy-eight (578) questionnaires were returned (55.7%). Three hundred and thirty-four (334) of the 578 respondents (57.8%) reported using herbal remedies during pregnancy with a mean of 1.2 remedies per woman (median: 1, range: 0-10). The most commonly used remedies were ginger, cranberry, and raspberry leaf. The most probable user had been pregnant before and had a university degree. "Family and friends" were the most frequently cited source of information about herbal remedies during pregnancy, and more than 75% of the users reportedly did not tell their doctor or midwife about the use.
The inter-rater correlation with respect to the TCM diagnoses among the 10 practitioners increased from 0.112 to 0.618 with training. Statistically significant improvements were found between the baseline and 18 month exercises (p &lt; 0.01).
Linkage analysis showed four significant peaks, 3q27.3, 8p11.21, 8q11.22-23, and 11q22.1-3, whose NPL Z scores are greater than 5.0. Among the significant loci, the 8q11.22-23 and 11q22.1-3 regions were supported by independent association analysis at the level of p &lt; 0.05.
Kampo medicine was chosen to address the necessity for a comprehensive treatment. We prescribed saikokaryukotsuboreito, with clear positive effect. Although headaches re-appeared when she later forgot to take the formula, the symptom disappeared by taking it again. Treatment was discontinued after 11 months, and the headache has not recurred for 3 years.
The median leukocyte value in the acupuncture arm at the first day of the third cycle of chemotherapy was significantly higher than in the control arm after adjusting for baseline value (8600 cells/microL, range: 4800-12,000 versus 4400 cell/microL, range: 2300-10,000) (p = 0.046). The incidence of grade 2-4 leukopenia was less in the acupuncture arm than in the sham arm (30% versus 90%; p = 0.02). However, the median leukocyte nadir, neutrophil nadir, and recovering ANC were all higher but not statistically significantly different (p = 0.116-0.16), after adjusting for baseline differences. There were no statistically significant differences in plasma G-CSF between the two groups.
The hypertensive patients had significantly elevated PIP and CRP levels in serum, increased LV wall thickness, and impaired LV diastolic function compared with the normotensive subjects (0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the placebo group, the transmitral flow velocities (E/A ratio) (1.11 +/- 0.36 versus 0.85 +/- 0.24, p &lt; 0.01) and the myocardial motion velocities (Em/Am ratio) at the septal mitral annulus (0.90 +/- 0.19 versus 0.70 +/- 0.18, p &lt; 0.05) and the lateral mitral annulus (1.06 +/- 0.20 versus 0.86 +/- 0.14, p &lt; 0.01) were significantly increased, while there was no significant change in the LV wall thickness after 72 weeks of therapy with Xuezhikang. The serum levels of PIP (0.43 +/- 0.13 ng/mL versus 0.51 +/- 0.20 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.05) and CRP (0.32 +/- 0.13 mg/L versus 0.40 +/-0.17 mg/L, p &lt; 0.05) were significantly reduced compared to placebo treatment. There was no significant correlation between changes in LV diastolic function and blood pressure or lipid profile with Xuezhikang therapy.
Twenty (20) nonsmoking, allergic subjects with asthma were included in the study. Eight (8) subjects (4 ASHMI and 4 placebo) reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms. No grade 3 AEs were observed during the study period. Vital signs, electrocardiogram findings, and laboratory results obtained at pre- and post-treatment visits remained within normal range. No abnormal immunologic alterations were detected.
Patients completed anonymous surveys about their perceptions of physician PDA use. Data were collected during 2006 and 2007 at 12 family medicine practices. Survey items included physician sex, patient demographics, if physicians explained why they were using the PDA, and Likert ratings on 8 dimensions of how a PDA can influence physician-patient interactions (surprise, confidence, feelings, comfort, communication, relationship, intelligence, and satisfaction). The survey response rate was 78%. Physicians explained to their patients what they were doing with the PDA 64% of the time. Logistic regression analyses determined that patients of male physicians, patients attending private practices and underserved sites, patients with Medicaid insurance, and patients who observed their physician using a PDA during both the index visit and at least one prior visit were more likely to receive an explanation of PDA use. Most importantly, physician-patient communication was rated significantly more positive if an explanation of PDA use was offered.
After the intervention, the rates of completed bone mineral density testing were 45.2% in the CR+PtEd group, 31.4% in the chart remainder only group, and 9.7% in the usual care practice. Bayesian analysis adjusted for patient and clinic characteristics, which made use of collateral data, gave an odds ratio of 5.47 for the effect of CR+PtEd group. The Bayesian P was .029 and the one-sided 95% credible interval for the odds ratio was greater than 1.2. The effect of CR+PtEd was confirmed by sensitivity analyses. Traditional hierarchical analysis adjusted for practice characteristics could not be used to estimate statistical significance because there were not enough clinics to accommodate a model that included all the important covariables.
Smoking, unhealthy diet, and inactivity were associated with more self-reported unhealthy days after adjusting for clustering and significant covariates. Smoking was associated with increased odds of more unhealthy days (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; P &lt; .0001), as was a poor diet (OR, 1.10; P &lt; .0001). More exercise (OR, 0.96; P = .0005) was associated with decreased odds of physical or mental unhealthy days.
Across 4 practices, 164 cases of skin and soft tissue infections were collected during 10 months. Of the 94 with a culture, 63 (67%) were MRSA positive. Patients working in or exposed to a health care setting were more likely to have a culture positive for MRSA, as were those presenting with an abscess. MRSA-positive lesions were also significantly smaller in size.
Data were available for 3936 pregnancies during the course of the study period. Results varied across the clinical interventions. Significant improvement in care processes was seen for 3 screening activities: (1) prenatal depression symptomatology (by 15 weeks' gestation); (2) screening for smoking at 30 weeks' gestation; (3) and postpartum contraception planning. Screening for smoking by 15 weeks' gestation and testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria were already conducted &gt;90% of the time during the baseline period and did not increase significantly after initiating the CQI program. Screening for postpartum depression symptomatology was recorded in 50% to 60% of women before the CQI program and did not increase significantly.
A sample of 102 health care professionals (10 physicians; 30 physician assistants or nurse practitioners; 36 medical students; 26 pharmacy, physican assistant, or nurse practitioner students) were randomly assigned to a no training group (n = 51) or a computer-based virtual reality intervention (n = 51). Professionals in both groups had similar pretest standardized patient alcohol screening skill scores: 53.2 (experimental) vs 54.4 (controls), 52.2 vs 53.7 alcohol brief intervention skills, and 42.9 vs 43.5 alcohol referral skills. After repeated practice with the simulation there were significant increases in the scores of the experimental group at 6 months after randomization compared with the control group for the screening (67.7 vs 58.1; P &lt; .001) and brief intervention (58.3 vs 51.6; P &lt; .04) scenarios.
Challenges (eg, added cost, time) and benefits (eg, improved research data collection process, enhanced data analysis) resulted from application of the CBPR model and are detailed.
Survey and qualitative data indicated strong interest in clinical research among current and potential PBRN members if it was relevant to improving quality of care in their practice or community. They also identified important perceived barriers (lack of time, inadequate training in research methods, lack of collaborators and support staff, institutional review board hurdles, and community distrust of research) and the necessary requirements for overcoming barriers to conducting research in busy clinical settings, which included collaborators, mentors, research support staff, and a trusting patient-clinician relationship.
Among 103 participating clinicians, statistically significant increases in knowledge acquisition were demonstrated for all but 2 of the individual topics and in total scores on the assessments. AN diagnostic sensitivity increased from 52% to 99% to 96% to 100%, whereas specificity increased from 70% to 96% to 74% to 97%. Total costs for the web aspects of the training were $3732.
Our study required IRB approval from a total of 19 local, hospital, academic center, and professional organization-based IRBs that reviewed a protocol of postpartum depression screening and follow-up completed in English or Spanish. Initial approval of the protocol and consent forms proceeded with only the usual barriers of submitting 19 different forms, and no protocol amendments were required. However, 2 unanticipated IRB issues provided significant additional work for the study team and the local practice sites. First, several IRBs required staff to repeat human subjects training every 1 to 2 years, resulting in 92 practicing physicians, residents, and members of the nursing staff spending time completing the exact same human subjects' training at least twice during the course of this study. Second, 17 of the 19 IRBs required that the patient be given consent forms that were newly stamped and dated each year, requiring the central site to reprint and replace consent forms yearly. Because not all IRBs returned the newly stamped and dated forms in a timely fashion, study enrollment with valid consent forms was interrupted in 4 sites for periods of 2 to 13 weeks.
With data on 99 paired samples, the POC method yielded a mean HbA1c of 7.38%, which was equivalent to the mean of 7.53% produced with all combined standard laboratory analyses. The Pearson correlation between POC and the laboratory analysis test results was 0.884 (P &lt; .001). POC test sensitivity was 81.8% and specificity was 93.2%. Eighteen percent of patients with an HbA1c &gt; = 7% by laboratory analysis were not identified as such by the POC test.
Foreign travel was the major risk factor for ciprofloxacin-resistant infection [adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) 24.0, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 12.6-45.9]. Among travellers, case patients were five times more likely to drink still bottled water (adjOR 4.7, 95% CI 1.0-21.7), whilst among non-travellers, case patients were three times more likely to drink sparkling bottled water (adjOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.4). There was no increased risk associated with eating poultry or prior quinolone use.
Ceftobiprole T &gt; MIC of &gt; or =100% (ceftobiprole MICs, &lt; or =2 mg/L) was bactericidal (&gt; or =3 log(10) killing) against MSSA, CA-MRSA, HA-MRSA, VISA and VRSA at 16 and 24 h. Vancomycin fAUC(24)/MIC of 340 (vancomycin MIC, 1 mg/L for MSSA and MRSA) resulted in a 1.8-2.6 log(10) reduction in colony count at 24 h. Vancomycin fAUC(24)/MIC of 85-170 (vancomycin MIC, 2-4 mg/L for VISA) resulted in a 0.4-0.7 log(10) reduction at 24 h. Vancomycin fAUC(24)/MIC of 5.3 (vancomycin MIC, 64 mg/L for VRSA) resulted in a limited effect.
MICs determined by MGIT methods showed 80%-100% agreement (+/-1 log(2) dilution) with those determined by the BACTEC and agar dilution methods for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, azithromycin and clofazimine. The MGIT and BACTEC methods showed 70%, 80% and 90% agreement (+/-1 log(2) dilution) for MICs of ethambutol, rifabutin and rifampicin; agreement for all drugs increased to 100% at 2 log(2) dilution differences. For clarithromycin, the MGIT method had greater agreement with the agar dilution method (70% at the same dilution) than the BACTEC method (60% at +/-1 log(2) dilution); agreement increased to 100% at +/-2 log(2) dilutions in both cases. The MGIT and agar dilution methods agreed 60% and 100% for amikacin MICs at +/-1 log(2) dilution and +/-2 log(2) dilutions, respectively. By all methods MICs were higher than achievable serum concentrations for isoniazid and dapsone. There was 100% agreement between all three methods for azithromycin, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin, and 80% agreement for rifampicin using published MIC thresholds available for M. avium complex strains.
Twenty isolates belonged to the two important clones representing KPC-possessing strains endemic to our region. Virtually all of these isolates had negligible or absent expression of the genes, and resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides could be explained by alternative mechanisms. All of these isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. A group of 14 heterogeneous isolates was also examined. There was a correlation between expression of marA with expression of soxS. Only expression of soxS was significantly correlated with expression of acrB. With a background substitution in GyrA, increased expression of acrB and marA appeared to contribute to fluoroquinolone resistance in some isolates. A correlation was noted between expression of soxS and ramA (but not marA and acrB) and tigecycline MICs. Following in vitro exposure to tigecycline, resistance occurred in association with a marked increase in marA and acrB expression in isolates lacking expression of soxS and ramA.
MIC/MPC values (mg/L) of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin for ATCC 49226 were 0.0078/0.03125, 0.0078/0.125 and 0.0156/0.0625, respectively. The MIC of all fluoroquinolones for m-49226 was 0.125 mg/L; MPCs of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin for this isolate were 4, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Concentrations of all agents are predicted to exceed the MPC for ATCC 49226 for the entire dosage interval, while concentrations of moxifloxacin alone will exceed the MPC for m-49226. The hierarchy of tested agents with respect to %T(MSW) [percentage of the dosage interval that concentrations fall within the mutant selection window (MSW)] for m-49226 was ciprofloxacin &gt; levofloxacin &gt; moxifloxacin. Multiple-dose fluoroquinolone regimens are predicted to achieve superior pharmacodynamics in comparison with single-dose regimens for m-49226, with increased AUC/MPC values and a reduced %T(MSW).
The MIC values of the liposomal aminoglycosides were similar to or lower than those of free aminoglycosides. Biofilm formation increased the bactericidal concentrations of these drugs by 8- to 256-fold and treatment with AlgL improved killing of the mucoid strain. The activity of some aminoglycosides against the sputum was increased by the addition of DNase or AlgL (P &lt; 0.05), and was increasingly evident with concurrent DNase and AlgL administration. Addition of mucin inhibited liposomal aminoglycosidic activity (up to 32-fold) evidently more than the free aminoglycosides (up to 8-fold). The addition of NAC did not improve activity significantly (P &gt; 0.05). Tobramycin was the most effective aminoglycoside to reduce biofilms and sputum.
Combination therapy with micafungin and amphotericin B gave excellent survival of infected mice compared with monotherapy with micafungin or amphotericin B alone. Combined therapy reduced the fungal burden in the lungs and the serum GM levels compared with monotherapy or untreated controls, resulting in a significant histological improvement with disappearance of fungi in the lungs.
A slight drift towards higher MICs of azithromycin was observed in the gonococcal population since 2001. Of greater concern was the first example of a shift to high-level resistance observed in six isolates in 2007. All six isolates were sequence type 649, which was not observed in any of the lower-level azithromycin-resistant isolates from 2007 or in any isolates tested from the same geographical locations. Contact tracing data for one patient suggested a link with Scotland. Disc diffusion testing of all 108 isolates showed that azithromycin, but not erythromycin, discs can differentiate between low-level and high-level resistance.
Of 118 episodes, 16 were excluded because patients died in the first 48 h. Among the 102 patients analysed, 33 (32%) had received combined beta-lactam and aminoglycoside therapy and 69 (68%) beta-lactam monotherapy. Both groups had similar demographic and clinical features, and rate of appropriate initial therapy. Overall mortality was 21/102 (20.6%). Early overall mortality was 11.8%: 27.3% (9/33) in the combined group and 4.3% (3/69) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.003). Late mortality was 8.8%. In the multivariate analysis, the factors predicting early mortality were renal failure, previous corticosteroid therapy and age &gt;65 years, whereas neoplastic disease and coma were associated with late mortality. Gentamicin administration did not decrease early mortality, but seemed to increase it. In the late mortality analysis, gentamicin use had no impact. In an analysis with the propensity score method for the use of aminoglycosides, combined therapy with this antibiotic was associated with an increasing trend for early mortality (OR 3.40, 95% CI 0.82-14.07).
The patients were treated with linezolid for a median duration of 359 days [interquartile range (IQR) 268-443 days]. Seventeen (71%) patients received 300 mg of linezolid once daily from the beginning of treatment for a median duration of 289 days (IQR 233-405 days). Of these patients, four developed peripheral neuropathy, one of whom discontinued linezolid. In seven (29%) patients, 600 mg/day linezolid was administered initially for a median duration of 104 days (IQR 26-145 days) followed by 300 mg/day linezolid for a median duration of 348 days (IQR 298-427 days). In five of these seven patients, the reason for changing from 600 to 300 mg/day was due to side effects of 600 mg/day linezolid (peripheral neuropathy in four patients and leucopenia in one patient). After reducing the dose to 300 mg/day, linezolid could be continued in six of the seven patients. Negative sputum conversion was achieved in 22 (92%) patients after a median of 89 days from the start of linezolid treatment (IQR 48-160 days).
PA30 was hypersusceptible to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and antimetabolites, with MICs at least 4-fold lower than those for the prototype strain PAO1, while PA431 was hypersusceptible to beta-lactams and antimetabolites. Both isolates overproduced the porin OprF but showed down-regulation in the production of the carbapenem channel OprD despite carbapenem hypersusceptibility. PA30 had decreased expression of the mexAB-oprM pump involved with intrinsic antibiotic resistance but overexpressed the mexCD-oprJ and mexEF-oprN efflux systems normally associated with acquired resistance. PA431 showed down-regulation of oprM, the last gene in the mexAB-oprM operon, but overexpressed the mexXY pump. The ampC beta-lactamase was weakly inducible in strain PA30, corresponding to cefoxitin hypersusceptibility.
One hundred and forty-three ESBL isolates were found positive with the assay. These isolates were all of O25b type and, when studied by multilocus sequence typing (25 cases), were all of ST131. The O25b-ST131 clone was found to produce ESBLs other than CTX-M-15, specifically CTX-M-2, -3, -14, -27, -32 and -61 as well as TEM-24. This clone represents 3% of non-ESBL B2 isolates originating from urinary tract infections in Paris.
Sixteen isolates (10 Salmonella Typhimurium, 2 Salmonella Anatum, 2 Salmonella Paratyphi B dT + , 1 Salmonella Infantis and 1 Salmonella London) carried bla(CTX-M) (15 bla(CTX-M-1) and one bla(CTX-M-15)) genes located on self-transferable IncB/O, IncI1 and/or IncN plasmids. Seven of the Salmonella Typhimurium isolates carried the SGI1-M variant. Six isolates (five Salmonella Agona and one Salmonella Kentucky) carried the bla(CMY-2) gene on IncI1 conjugative plasmids. bla(TEM-20) genes were detected in two Salmonella Paratyphi B dT+ isolates, and bla(TEM-52) in one Salmonella Paratyphi B dT+ and one Salmonella Virchow, located on IncI1 plasmids. All Salmonella Paratyphi isolates harboured a 2300 bp/dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 class 2 integron.
When antimicrobial resistance in EAEC and ETEC isolates was compared between the two periods of time, a statistically significant increase in resistance (P &lt; 0.01) was observed in EAEC for chloramphenicol and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, whereas in ETEC it was for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Mutations in the gyrA gene were found in all nalidixic acid-resistant isolates, whereas mutation(s) in both gyrA and parC genes were found in the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates.
Adaptation occurred through parallel stepwise increases in the moxifloxacin MICs up to 512-fold the MIC for the parental strain. Mutations affected the topoisomerase II-encoding genes gyrA, parC and gyrB, reflecting a high degree of genetic parallelism across the independent lineages. During evolution, the T83I change in GyrA occurred first, followed by G78D or S80R in ParC and D87N in GyrA, or S464Y or D426N in GyrB. By constructing isogenic strains, we showed that the progressive increase in resistance was linked to a precise order of mutation substitution, but also to the co-existence of several subpopulations of bacteria bearing different mutations.
Eight patients (four in each group) had persistent infection following the first attempt of surgery and antibiotic treatment; in three of them the infection was cured by additional debridement prior to re-implantation. Forty-two (91%) patients in the long-term group and 47 (89%) patients in the short-term group were free of infection (P = 0.67) at an average follow-up of 43 months (range, 24-60 months). Five (11%) patients developed complications related to prolonged antibiotic therapy. The short-term treatment resulted in a shorter hospital stay (18 versus 43 days, P &lt; 0.001) and a lower direct medical cost (US$13 732 versus US$21 756, P &lt; 0.001).
Forty-nine trials, including 19 882 patients, published between 2000 and 2008, met the inclusion criteria. Only one of the trials reported on AE collection methods. Twenty-six trials reported only AEs attributed to drugs, 17 of which did not refer to the attribution methods. AE reporting was nearly always selective and selection criteria were highly variable, based on severity grading or occurrence threshold. Presentation of AEs above an occurrence threshold was more common in studies sponsored by industry (30/31) than in studies sponsored by non-profit organizations (3/18). Moreover, we showed that differences in the methods of reporting AEs may affect the results reported for AEs. No significant improvement in AE reporting was seen over this period.
Of the randomized patients, 99% reported information regarding their compliance and adverse events. A 100% tablet intake was reported by 90% of the clarithromycin group and by 93.7% of the placebo group. Of the clarithromycin patients, 39.5% reported at least one non-serious adverse event versus 25.1% of the placebo patients (P &lt; 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported 950 times by 697 patients (32.3%) in the clarithromycin group and 485 times by 390 patients (17.9%) in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were seen in other non-serious or serious adverse events during the first month after inclusion. Short-term non-serious adverse events did not explain the previously reported long-term significantly increased mortality associated with clarithromycin.
Fifty-nine courses were post-HSCT (42%, 49 allogeneic), and 92 courses were started during granulocytopenia (65%). The median duration of LAMB therapy was 13 days (range 1-79), and the median maximum dosage was 2.8 mg/kg (range 0.93-5.10). Mild-to-moderate adverse events were noted during 109 courses (77%; hepatic, 58.8%; electrolyte wasting, 52.5%; renal, 31.9%; infusion-related reactions, 8.5%); adverse events necessitating discontinuation of LAMB occurred in 6 courses (4.3%; renal, 3; anaphylaxis, 2; hepatic, 1). While median hepatic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and blood urea nitrogen values were slightly (P &lt; 0.01) higher at end of treatment (EOT), bilirubin and creatinine values were not different from baseline. Complete or partial responses were observed in 16/19 and 2/7 courses for possible and probable/proven invasive infections. Thirty-two of 33 courses of prophylaxis and 74 of 83 courses of empirical therapy were completed with success. Overall survival was 90.8% at 3 months post-EOT.
NXL104 was a potent inhibitor of KPC-2 with an IC(50) of 38 nM. NXL104 restored the antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and piperacillin against Enterobacteriaceae strains producing KPC-2 or KPC-3. MIC values of ceftazidime against KPC producers were reduced by up to 1000-fold by combination with NXL104.
Dissolution of albendazole from solid dispersions was markedly enhanced by increasing the polymer concentration. At a 1:9 drug:polymer ratio, &gt;90% of the albendazole was dissolved in 10 min. SEM showed microparticles to be of small spherical shape compared with the pure components. In vivo evaluation of larva migration showed that both albendazole-PEG 6000 solutions exhibited a greater anthelmintic effect in the brain (0 larvae/mouse). In addition it was also found that liver and lung showed a significant decrease in the number of larvae. Evaluation of vehicle toxicity (PEG 6000 in water) showed a mice survival rate of 100% at the assayed concentrations.
ESBLs had no effect on the activity of razupenem against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., and only a small effect when coupled with outer membrane impermeability. Inducible or, more especially, derepressed AmpC enzymes gave some protection, with most AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. requiring MICs of approximately 8 mg/L. This relative resistance was further increased when porins were lost, restricting drug uptake. Metallo- and class A-carbapenemases conferred resistance, with MICs &gt; or =16 mg/L.
Thymidine analogue resistance mutations were strongly associated with therapy failure to all nucleoside analogue combinations analysed. Previously identified accessory mutations at positions 35, 39, 43, 90, 98, 101, 122, 178, 196, 203, 208, 221, 223 and 228 were associated with therapy failure with at least one of the drug combinations studied. Interestingly, several mutations affecting RT thumb subdomain polymorphisms were strongly associated (P &lt; 10(-3)) with therapy failure to abacavir/stavudine, stavudine/didanosine and abacavir/stavudine/didanosine. Mutations A272P, K277R and V293I were more prevalent in patients failing treatment with abacavir/stavudine than in naive individuals, while mutation frequencies of T286A, V292I and to a lesser extent E291D and E297K decreased in the treated population. These effects were also detected for A272P, T286A and V292I, when analysing didanosine/stavudine therapy failure, although statistical significance was higher for T286A.
There was no difference in the week 24 AAUCMB between the regimens. The proportion of patients with &lt;50 copies/mL of plasma HIV RNA was 21%, 24% and 20%, respectively, by time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) analysis. High baseline drug resistance provided some explanation for the low efficacy. A lower baseline background drug resistance and higher fosamprenavir genotypic inhibitory quotient led to better antiviral responses. The plasma amprenavir trough concentartion (C(tau)) was 49% higher in the HD-FPV/RTV arm than in the STD-FPV/RTV arm and similar in the FPV/LPV/RTV and STD-FPV/RTV arms. The plasma lopinavir C(tau) was similar to historical data with standard LPV/RTV 400 mg/100 mg twice daily. All regimens were relatively well tolerated, although diarrhoea was more frequent in the HD-FPV/RTV and FPV/LPV/RTV arms, and hypertriglyceridaemia and increased total cholesterol were more common in the FPV/LPV/RTV arm.
For 60 strains the hot-spot region of the rpoB gene was sequenced, confirming the results of the hybridization assays and allowing the identification of new mutations. In total, 17 mutations involving 10 codons were observed, two of which are newly described (D516Y and E562G/P564L). Mutations L533P, H526L, D516Y and L511P and the double mutation E562G/P564L conferred a low level of resistance.
A total of 3729 non-duplicate isolates were identifed, including 43 (1.2%) meningeal isolates showing high rates of penicillin (79.1%) and ceftriaxone (34.9%) resistance. For non-meningeal isolates, penicillin non-susceptibility was reduced significantly from 75.1% (72.4% in 2000-03 increasing to 77.4% in 2004-07) to 16% (28.6% in 2000 decreasing to 2.4% in 2007) if the modified breakpoints were applied. However, isolates for which penicillin MICs were 1-2 mg/L increased significantly from 34.2% in 2000 to 59.8% in 2007. Ceftriaxone non-susceptibility also increased significantly from 2.8% before 2005 to 18.4% thereafter. A quarter (25.7%) of the pneumococcal isolates were recovered from patients &lt;10 years old. Higher resistance to penicillin (89.8% versus 70.4%; or 19.1% versus 13.2% by the modified breakpoints) or ceftriaxone (11.1% versus 5.8%) was found among these isolates, compared with those from older patients.
Eighteen different mutation types were found in the rpoB region of rifampicin-resistant isolates. Isolates with mutations at residues rpoB531 (64.1%), rpoB526 (15.2%) and rpoB516 (8.7%) were the most common. In addition, an insertion was found at residue 514. Three phenotypically rifampicin-resistant isolates (3.3%) were genotypically wild-type. In isoniazid-resistant strains, mutations were found most commonly at katG315 (45.4%) as well as at the inhA promoter region (28.6%). Thirty-nine isolates (25.3%) were phenotypically isoniazid-resistant but genotypically wild-type. The katG315 mutation was statistically associated with multidrug-resistant isolates.
A constitutive and enhanced expression of GFP in promastigote and amastigote stages was achieved for approximately 12 months without any need for drug pressure. These transfectants were highly infective to macrophage cell lines as well as to hamsters, as observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (FACS). GFP-tagged promastigotes as well as intracellular amastigotes were found to be highly susceptible to miltefosine, amphotericin B and pentamidine, in a concentration-dependent manner. SAG was inactive against the GFP-promastigotes, as well as SAG-resistant intracellular amastigotes, correlating well with earlier reports.
The 47 K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited various susceptibilities to imipenem and meropenem; all were non-susceptible to ertapenem and several other antibiotics but most were susceptible to gentamicin, colistin and tigecycline. PFGE classified the isolates into two clonal types, with the predominant type, which was closely related to that of hyperepidemic strains from the USA and Israel, comprising three subtypes. All isolates carried the bla(KPC-2) gene; 45 also carried bla(SHV-12) and 29 bla(TEM-1). Patients were hospitalized in nine different units. The median length of hospital stay prior to KPC isolation was 21 days; 38 patients (80.9%) had evidence of clinical infection due to a KPC producer and 16 (34%) had bacteraemia. The crude mortality rate was 27.7%. A beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination was the most frequently administered antimicrobial prior to KPC isolation (20 patients; 42.5%), whereas only nine patients (19.1%) had prior carbapenem use.
A metronidazole-resistant mutant was isolated and the transposon insertion site was identified in an intergenic region between the rhaO and rhaR genes of the gene cluster involved in the uptake and catabolism of rhamnose. Metronidazole resistance was observed during growth in defined medium containing either rhamnose or glucose. The metronidazole-resistant mutant showed improved growth in the presence of rhamnose as compared with the wild-type parent. There was increased transcription of all genes of the rhamnose gene cluster in the presence of rhamnose and glucose, likely due to the transposon providing an additional promoter for the rhaR gene, encoding the positive transcriptional regulator of the rhamnose operon. The B. thetaiotaomicron metronidazole resistance phenotype was recreated by overexpressing the rhaR gene in the B. thetaiotaomicron wild-type parent. Both the metronidazole-resistant transposon mutant and RhaR overexpression strains displayed a phenotype of higher lactate dehydrogenase and lower pyruvate oxidoreductase activity in comparison with the parent strain during growth in rhamnose.
Eukaryotic expression vector HIF-1alpha-pcDNA(3.1) was constructed successfully. Analyzed by flow cytometer, The MSCs' surfaces mark were CD44+, SH3(CD73)+, CD34-, CD45- and the CD44+ cells and SH3(CD73)+ cells were 94.7% and 97.3%, respectively, showing the high purity of the cultured MSCs. After inducing, the cultured MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes successfully. In HIF-1alpha gene transfected MSCs, the expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA and HIF-1alpha protein were both increased obviously.
In all patients, DWI disclosed small punctuate (1-3 mm), high-signal lesions in the lateral portion of the hippocampus. The initial SPECT also revealed hypoperfusion in the cerebellar vermis, which had recovered by the follow-up examination. Three patients showed saccadic hypermetria or impaired smooth pursuit only during the acute phase.
Severe impairments were observed in most domains for the ET group compared to the controls, including attention, part of language function, verbal memory, and frontal executive functions.
In a univariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of moderate-to-severe WMC in AD was significantly associated with increasing age, female gender, lower education level, hypertension, high plasma tHcy levels, and lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed only high plasma tHcy as the independent and significant risk factor for moderate-to-severe WMC [odds ratio (OR; adjusted for age, gender, education level, MMSE score, and hypertension comparing the top tertile - tHcy levels &gt;/=12.9 micromol/L - with the bottom tertile - tHcy levels &lt;/=9.4 micromol/L)=7.35; 95% confidence interval, confidence interval=1.36-39.84; p=0.02], and age as a borderline significant risk factor (OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.99-1.19, p=0.09) in AD patients. Plasma tHcy levels were not correlated significantly with either right or left MTA.
True scoliosis was found in 32 of the 97 PD patients, and was observed more frequently in women than in men (28 vs. 4, respectively; p=0.006). The age of patients without scoliosis was significantly lower than that of those with scoliosis (66.5+/-9.2 years vs. 72.8+/-7.3 years, respectively, mean+/-SD, p&lt;0.001). There was no correlation between PD symptom laterality and scoliosis. The rate of occurrence of scoliosis did not differ between de novo and levodopa (L-dopa)-treated patients.
There were 90 men and 74 women in the study, with median age of 63 years. Radiation doses ranging from 60 to 70 Gy (median = 63 Gy) in 30 to 58 fractions were given to 158 patients (96.3%) and platinum-based chemotherapy to 147 (89.6%). Grade &gt; or = 2 and grade &gt; or = 3 RP were observed in 74 (45.1%) and 36 patients (22.0%), respectively. Multivariate analysis found CT/CC genotypes of TGFbeta1 rs1982073:T869C to be associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of RP grades &gt; or = 2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.489; 95% CI, 0.227 to 0.861; P = .013) and grades &gt; or = 3 (HR = 0.390; 95% CI, 0.197 to .774; P = 0.007), respectively, compared with the TT genotype, after adjustment for Karnofsky performance status, smoking status, pulmonary function, and dosimetric parameters.
A total of 330 PCPs responded (adjusted response rate, 51.7%). After completion of active treatment, PCPs were willing to assume exclusive responsibility for routine follow-up care after 2.4 +/- 2.3 years had elapsed for prostate cancer, 2.6 +/- 2.6 years for colorectal cancer, 2.8 +/- 2.5 years for breast cancer, and 3.2 +/- 2.7 years for lymphoma. PCPs already providing this care were willing to provide exclusive care sooner. The most useful modalities PCPs felt would assist them in assuming exclusive responsibility for follow-up cancer care were (1) a patient-specific letter from the specialist, (2) printed guidelines, (3) expedited routes of rereferral, and (4) expedited access to investigations for suspected recurrence.
Adults with rhabdomyosarcoma had significantly worse outcome than children (5-year overall survival rates, 27% +/- 1.4% and 61% +/- 1.4%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). Tumors in adults were more likely to be at an unfavorable site (65% v 55%; P &lt; .0001) and to have histologies that are unusual during childhood, particularly the pleomorphic subtype (19%) and not otherwise specified (43%). Regional and distant spread was not more frequent in adults. Adults had significantly worse outcome than children with similar tumors. The most significant difference was in localized disease; 5-year survival estimates were 82% +/- 2.0% for children and 47% +/- 2.9% for adults (P &lt; .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that age, histologic subtype, primary site location, stage, and local control with surgery and/or radiation were significant predictors of survival. However, alveolar subtype and unfavorable primary site lost significance when analysis was restricted to adults.
Overall rates of grade 4 or 5 toxicities were nearly identical in the FOLFOX6 and FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab arms (15.2% and 15.0%, respectively). Six-month mortality rates were 0.96% and 0.90% for the control and experimental groups, respectively. Grade 3+ toxicities that occurred more often in the experimental arm versus control arm included hypertension (12% v 1.8%, respectively), wound complications (abdominal incisional hernia or infusion port dehiscence/inflammation; 1.7% v 0.3%, respectively), pain (11.1% v 6.3%, respectively), and proteinuria (2.7% v 0.8%, respectively). Grade 2+ neuropathy was increased in the experimental arm versus the control arm (grade 2, 33% v 29%, respectively; grade 3, 16% v 14%, respectively; and grade 4, &lt; 1% each). In the experimental arm versus control arm, significantly less thrombocytopenia (1.4% v 3.4%, respectively) and fewer allergic reactions (3.1% v 4.7%, respectively) were observed. Advanced age was associated with a significantly greater rate of grade 4 and 5 toxicities regardless of treatment.
Progression-free survival at 3 years was 52%. Overall- and cancer-specific survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 86%, 65%, 60%, and 93%, 88%, 88%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with T1 or T2 tumors. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4 to 47 months), 27 patients (47%) were deceased, seven as a result of lung cancer and 20 as a result of concurrent disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated local control at 3 years was 92%. Local relapse was observed in four patients (7%). Regional relapse was observed in three patients (5%). Nine patients (16%) developed distant metastases. The estimated risk of all failure (local, regional, or distant metastases) was increased in patients with T2 (41%) compared with those with T1 (18%) tumors (P = .027).
from the first 30 procedures were assessed for a potential learning curve. Results A total of 323 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma, which included 611 clinically node-negative groins, were scheduled for sentinel node biopsy. A sentinel node was found in 572 of the 592 groins (97%) that proceeded to sentinel node biopsy. In 79 groins, a sentinel node was positive for tumor. Six inguinal node recurrences occurred after a negative sentinel node procedure, all within 15 months after sentinel node biopsy. The combined false-negative rate was 7%. Complications occurred in 4.7% of explored groins. None of the false-negative procedures occurred in the initial 30 procedures.
Eighteen patients were treated in three cohorts. Two patients in separate cohorts experienced UHT; the maximum-tolerated dose for this regimen was not reached. The median interval between (153)Sm doses was 35 days (range, 27 to 57 days). The only significant toxicity was mild, transient myelosuppression. Five patients (28%) experienced grade 3 hematologic toxicity. There were no grade &gt; or = 4 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities.
Fifty patients were enrolled and received treatment. The median follow-up was 13.0 months, and the median number of treatment cycles was seven (range, one to 51). Thirty patients (60%) completed &gt; or = six treatment cycles, and nine (18%) completed &gt; or = 18 treatment cycles. Among the 49 patients assessable for response, the objective response rate was 55% (95% CI, 41% to 69%). Median progression-free and overall survival rates were 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.2 to 11.5 months) and 14.1 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 19.6 months), respectively. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was modest-anemia (6%; 0), neutropenia (4%; 0), and thrombocytopenia (0; 8%). Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were proteinuria (2%; 0), venous thrombosis (4%; 2%), arterial thrombosis (2%; 0), fatigue (8%; 0), infection (8%; 2%), nephrotoxicity (2%; 0), and diverticulitis (6%; 2%). There were no grade 3 or greater hemorrhagic events or hypertension cases.
Twenty-eight (11%) of 251 registered patients with precursor T-cell LBL (T-LBL) and six (8%) of 73 patients with precursor B-cell LBL (pB-LBL) suffered from relapse. Of the 28 patients with T-LBL, one died from infection during relapse chemotherapy, 18 failed to achieve stable remission and died from disease progression, and nine reached allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT). Two of these nine patients who underwent SCT died from transplantation-associated toxicity, three died from disease progression, and four are still alive. These four patients are in second remission of their lymphoma for 48, 68, 125, and 131 months, respectively, after allogeneic SCT. One of the four patients developed colon adenocarcinoma 47 months after SCT. Of the six patients with pB-LBL who experienced relapse, one patient died as a result of toxicity of relapse chemotherapy, two died from disease progression after chemotherapy, and three received allogeneic SCT. Of these, two died from subsequent disease progression, and one is still alive 57 months after allogeneic SCT.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 43), polymorphic PTLD (n = 10), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 7), Burkitts lymphoma (n = 6), plasmacytoma (n = 5), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (n = 3) were all over-represented in the SOT population compared with a population sample from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database; follicular lymphoma (n = 0) was underrepresented. Negative pretransplantation Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology was a risk factor for PTLD. Available histologic analysis of tumor tissue showed that 75% were CD20 positive and that 62% were EBV positive; EBV-positive tumors occurred sooner after SOT than EBV-negative tumors (mean, 29 v 66 months). Extralymphatic disease (79%), poor performance status (68%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 71%), and advanced stage (68%) disease were all common at the time of lymphoma diagnosis. Two thirds of patients had a complete response when treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone-like chemotherapy (either with or without rituximab). Median overall survival in all patients with PTLD was 8.23 years (95% CI, 2.28 to 30.0 years).
Veltuzumab was well tolerated, with no grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events despite short infusion times (typically 2 hours initially, 1 hour subsequently at doses &lt; 375 mg/m(2)). In follicular lymphoma, 24 (44%) of 55 patients had objective responses (OR), with 15 (27%) complete responses (CRs) or CRs unconfirmed (CRus) by International Working Group criteria, and with some responses occurring despite two to five prior rituximab-containing regimens, less favorable prognosis (elevated lactate dehydrogenase, tumors &gt; 5 cm, and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index &gt; or = 2), and at all dose levels. The CRs/CRus were durable (median duration, 19.7 months), with five patients still ongoing (15.9 to 37.6 months duration). In marginal zone lymphoma, five (83%) of six patients had ORs, with two CRs/CRus (33%), and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, three (43%) of seven patients achieved partial responses. At all dose levels studied, B cells were depleted after the first infusion, veltuzumab serum half-lives were similar after the fourth infusion, and mean antibody serum levels exceeded values considered important for anti-CD20 therapy (ie, 25 microg/mL).
The final OS of patients receiving sorafenib was comparable with that of patients receiving placebo (17.8 v 15.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; P = .146); however, when post-cross-over placebo survival data were censored, the difference became significant (17.8 v 14.3 months, respectively; HR = 0.78; P = .029). Adverse events at 16 months after cross over were similar to those previously reported. Baseline VEGF levels correlated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P &lt; .0001), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center score (P &lt; .0001), and PFS and OS in univariate (PFS, P = .0013; OS, P = .0009) and multivariate (PFS, P = .0231; OS, P = .0416) analyses of placebo patients and with short OS by multivariate analysis of patients receiving sorafenib (P = .0145). Both high-VEGF (P &lt; .01) and low-VEGF (P &lt; .01) groups benefited from sorafenib.
In 102 evaluable patients, the median overall survival time was 14 months (range, 1 to &gt; 41 months). Midtherapy CTC levels correlated with FDG-PET/CT response in 68 (67%) of 102 evaluable patients. In univariate analysis, midtherapy CTC counts and FDG-PET/CT response predicted overall survival (P &lt; .001 and P = .001, respectively). FDG-PET/CT predicted overall survival (P = .0086) in 31 (91%) of 34 discordant patients who had fewer than five CTCs at midtherapy. Only midtherapy CTC levels remained significant in a multivariate analysis (P = .004).
We found 13 RCTs including 3,027 patients. Extending chemotherapy improved PFS substantially (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.81; P &lt; .00001) and OS modestly (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99; P = .03). Subgroup analysis revealed that effects on PFS were greater for trials extending chemotherapy with third-generation regimens rather than older regimens (HR, 0.70 interaction v 0.92 interaction; P = .003). Extending chemotherapy was associated with more frequent AE in all trials where it was reported and impaired HRQL in two of seven trials.
The rate of pCR was 24% in the metformin group, 8.0% in the nonmetformin group, and 16% in the nondiabetic group (P = .02). Pairwise comparisons between the metformin and nonmetformin groups (P = .007) and the nonmetformin and nondiabetic groups (P = .04) were significant. Comparison of the pCR rates between the metformin and nondiabetic groups trended toward but did not meet significance (P = .10). Metformin use was independently predictive of pCR (odds ratio, 2.95; P = .04) after adjustment for diabetes, body mass index, age, stage, grade, receptor status, and neoadjuvant taxane use.
Of 233 patients, 217 (93%) never required surgical palliation of their primary tumor. Sixteen patients (7%) required emergent surgery for primary tumor obstruction or perforation, 10 patients (4%) required nonoperative intervention (ie, stent or radiotherapy), and 213 (89%) never required any direct symptomatic management for their intact primary tumor. Of those 213 patients, 47 patients (20%) ultimately underwent elective colon resection at the time of metastasectomy, and eight patients (3%) underwent this resection during laparotomy for hepatic artery infusion pump placement. Use of bevacizumab, location of the primary tumor in the rectum, and metastatic disease burden were not associated with increased intervention rate.
Serum sCD163 treated as an updated continuous covariate as well as the baseline value were analyzed together with the covariate's ulceration and thickness in a Cox proportional hazards model. sCD163 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (baseline, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.7; P = .01; and updated, HR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.8; P = .003). Melanomas with dense CD163(+) macrophage infiltration in tumor stroma and CD68(+) macrophage infiltration at the invasive front were associated with poor overall survival (CD163, HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 0.8 to 9.3; P = .11; and CD68, HR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.8; P = .02) independent (borderline for CD163) of thickness and ulceration.
Expression of p63 (4A4) and p63 (H-137) is similar in all conditions, although there is some variation in psoriasis. However, expression of p63alpha (C-12) is markedly different. In normal skin, p63alpha (C-12)-positive cells were scattered in whole epidermis. But in psoriasis, p63alpha (C-12)-positive cells were observed at the tips of rete ridges. In SEs, p63alpha (C-12)-positive cells were not well observed. Western blot results showed that the RA cells express p63 (4A4) and p63 (H-137) strongly compared with SA or nonadhering (NA) cells. In contrast, SA or NA cells strongly express p63alpha (C-12).
Four different histopathologic patterns were observed: interstitial (57.9%), palisadic granulomatous (26.3%), sarcoidal granulomatous (5.3%) and mixed (10.5%). Dermal mucin deposition was determined in 84.2% of specimens. Solar elastosis was observed in only seven specimens, and elastophagocytosis was observed in only two specimens. Collagen and elastic tissue damages were consistent findings in all biopsy specimens. Fibrin thrombi and vasculitic changes were not found in any of the specimens from this patient group.
Elastin immunostain was superior to EVG in showing the elastic fiber patterns. In nevi, the elastic fibers were preserved between nests and often around individual melanocytes. In contrast, melanomas had markedly decreased elastic fibers in the stroma and within the nests of melanocytes. The melanoma pushed down the pre-existing thin elastic fibers of the papillary dermis, forming a compressed layer at its base, which separated the melanoma from the nevus. On sun-damaged skin, the solar elastosis had similar elastin and EVG patterns. In three cases with dense inflammation, the layer of elastic fibers between melanoma and nevus was still present but less evident.
CD163 was expressed in 11 of 14 (79%) AFXs, with moderate to strong intensity. No staining was observed in cases of spindle cell SCC (0/5) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (0/10). Rare spindle cell/desmoplastic melanomas (2/7) and cutaneous leiomyosarcomas (1/5) demonstrated positive staining. CD163 reactivity was seen in 24 of 29 of benign fibrous histiocytomas (BFHs), including 8 of 8 cellular fibrous histiocytomas and 6 of 9 epithelioid cell histiocytomas. The majority of cutaneous histiocytic lesions, including juvenile xanthogranuloma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Rosai-Dorfman disease, were positive for CD163.
All three cases displayed the B-cell phenotype and showed monoclonality with immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. Bcl2 was expressed in the two systemic IVLBCL cases with fatal outcomes. The third patient with the 'cutaneous variant' achieved complete remission and a longer survival time of 15 months after chemotherapy.
The SCE and MN frequencies were significantly higher in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p &lt; 0.00001, p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively), and the MDA level was significantly higher in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly lower in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively).
All of the patients were male patients. Their age ranged from 17 to 29 years with a mean of 21.60 +/- 3.13 years. They had Fitzpatrick skin type III, IV and V. The patients have got 3 to 8 sessions of LHR (mean 4.87 +/- 1.64). Follow up period lasted between 12 to 23 months. None of the patients, who underwent LHR, has required further surgical treatment to date. Seven patients out of ten in the control group have developed recurrent PNS. Pain was the most frequent side effect and it was seen in 6 patients (40%).
The histopathologic findings were characterized by an interface dermatitis with sparse perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and scattered necrotic keratinocytes, especially in the upper part of epidermis. Direct immunofluorescence studies excluded lupus-like pattern, revealing nests of fluorescent bodies at the dermal-epidermal junction and in papillary dermis.
Active melanocytes were detected in black hairs of 6.7% of vitiligo patients and in 100% of apparently normal skin of the same patients and controls. On examining black hairs of the 28 vitiligo patients with negative DOPA reaction, 19 of them (67.9%) showed positive NKI/beteb stain. Disease duration was inversely correlated with the melanocytes' presence within hair follicles. Melanocytes were absent from 100% of white hairs.
Of 711 patients, 64% reported joint pain and 79% nail psoriasis at baseline. Patients with baseline joint pain or nail psoriasis had significantly worse HR-QoL than unaffected patients. Mean baseline differences between patients with and without joint pain in DLQI (3.3), EQ-5D utility (0.2), and EQ-5D VAS (7.3) were clinically meaningful. In patients with nail psoriasis, a clinically meaningful difference in EQ-5D VAS (5.0) was seen. Etanercept significantly improved symptom severity and HR-QoL. Patients with joint pain had improvements of 47%, 61%, 29%, and 23% in mean joint pain score, DLQI, EQ-5D utility, and EQ-5D VAS, respectively, at Week 54. Patients with nail psoriasis had improvements of 51%, 63%, and 24% in NAPSI, DLQI, and EQ-5D VAS.
Minimal incision method successfully treated 16 out of the 22 epidermoid cyst cases that ranged from 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. And only one out of six was successfully treated for diameters greater than 1.1 cm.
Treatment with the two-compound scalp formulation (n = 207) resulted in significant improvements from baseline on the SF-36v2 (Physical Component Summary, P = 0.005, week 8; Mental Component Summary, P &lt; 0.05, weeks 2, 4, 8). A significant change from baseline in the calcipotriol scalp solution group (n = 105) was seen only on the Mental Component Summary (P = 0.04, week 8). Change from baseline in Skindex-16 was significantly in favour of the two-compound scalp formulation. Change was significant on both total score and individual scales.
In both groups, decreased VAS scores were observed, but naltrexone showed to be significantly more effective than placebo in decreasing VAS score after 1 week (P &lt; 0.005) and 2 weeks (P &lt; 0.001).
After the first week of treatment in the study group, the reduction of PASI score was 44%, statistically significant greater than the reduction of PASI score in the second group (37%). Quality of life estimated by DLQI indicated significant lower values in the first (study) group.
A decrease in NAPSI score was observed with both treatments and in both nail matrix and nail bed involvement. No statistical differences were found between PDT and PDL (P = 0.632, P = 0.084, P = 0.535, at baseline, and 3 and 6 months, respectively), and between nail matrix and nail bed NAPSI scores (P = 0.423 and P = 0.853, respectively). The subjective impression of the patients was good, especially regarding the decrease in the pain.
A total of 178 patients including 78 (43.8%) males and 100 (56.2%) females entered the study. The commonest psychocutaneous disorder was neurotic excoriation followed by trichotillomania, delusion of parasitosis and dermatitis artefacta. Mood disorder was the commonest DSM-IV disorder in our patients, then anxiety disorder and drug-induced symptoms.
Three hundred forty-seven (77.5%) questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Most of the patients knew about HIV incurability (89.4%), HIV transmissibility during needle sharing (95.3%), or vaginal (87.4%) and anal intercourse (79.5%), as well as about HIV prevention by condom use (97.8%), and use of single needles (76.2%). However, knowledge gaps and misconceptions were detected regarding the risk of HIV transmission during oral sex, and the efficacy of sexual fidelity and avoidance of blood transfusions in HIV prevention. The lowest knowledge level (&lt; 50% correct answers) was detected in patients aged 50-59 years, in unemployed, divorced/widowed, and in those without or with incomplete school education.
Fifteen patients with 40 target lesions completed the study. Twice-daily treatment induced excellent (&gt; 75%) repigmentation in two lesions, moderate (&gt; 25-50%) and poor (1-25%) repigmentation in four lesions each, and no response in five lesions. Once-daily treatment resulted in moderate repigmentation in two lesions and poor repigmentation in five lesions, whereas no effect was observed in the remaining eight lesions. One out of 10 control lesions developed moderate spontaneous repigmentation, the other nine remained unchanged. Besides the frequency of tacrolimus application, the treatment outcome was determined by the localization of the affected areas with the facial region showing the best response.
Capsule endoscopy showed probable small bowel mass lesions in six patients, and a low lesion probability in the other six. Capsule endoscopy showed that new lesions were not detected by esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy. All six patients with probable small bowel tumors were found to have pathological findings upon capsule endoscopy: two with lymphangioma, and one each with ileal ectopic pancreas, with melanoma metastasis, gastrointestinal lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
The immunogenicity results obtained 1 month after vaccination with Mencevax ACWY vaccine indicated that the vaccine elicited a good immune response in vaccinees aged 2-30 years. This was both in terms of functional activity directed against meningococcal polysaccharide (A, C, W-135 and Y) as measured by serum bactericidal assay (&gt; 93% activity against all serogroups), and specific IgG concentrations measured by ELISA (&gt; 96% seropositivity to all serogroups).
One hundred and sixty-nine patients completed the study: 86 in the control group and 83 in the study group. The incidence of nausea was lower in the study group (41%) than in the control group (65%). The incidence of vomiting, use of antiemetics, pruritus, and use of antipruritics did not differ between the two groups. The numerical rating pain score and PCA requirements were not significantly different between the two groups.
There was no statistically significant difference in Cd concentration between the CaP and BPH groups. Immunoblots from both groups revealed a single band. The relative intensity of the MT band was 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the BPH group and 0.17 +/- 0.03 in the CaP group. MT expression in patients with BPH was 3.4-fold higher than in those with CaP.
MDA level in alcoholics was higher at baseline than in healthy controls. It decreased after 1 week of detoxification, and normalized at week 2. SOD and GPX activities remained significantly lower throughout the 2-week period. CAT activity in alcoholics was comparable to that in the controls at baseline, but decreased at week 1 of detoxification, and was significantly lower than that in the controls after 2 weeks. Moreover, baseline MDA level was correlated with baseline CAT activity in alcoholics; the magnitude of the decrease in MDA level was correlated with the decrease in CAT activity following the 1-week detoxification.
Retrospective analysis of the medical records revealed that 48 OI patients could be classified into types I (n = 19), III (n = 10), and IV (n = 19). There were statistically significant differences between these three types in terms of height, weight, BMD, dentinogenesis imperfecta, bone deformity, scoliosis, walking ability, annual fracture rate, and family history. However, no significant differences were noted for blue sclera (p = 0.075) and hearing loss (p = 0.832).
Linear regression showed that all three compartments (V UT, V LT and V AB) in the inspiratory phase were correlated highly with DE during tidal and deep breathing. However, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the VAB contributed 94-95% of the variance when performing either tidal or deep breathing. A predicted equation for diaphragmatic movement during deep breathing was DE = 0.052 + 0.294 V AB.
In cohort 1, the percentage of memory B cells that expressed IgM was lower among HIV+CN+ subjects, compared with HIV+CN- subjects (P &lt; .01) and HIV- subjects (P &lt; .05); expression of IgM on 50% of memory B cells was a significant predictor of C. neoformans disease status (odds ratio, 5.5; P = .03). In cohort 2, the percentage of memory B cells that expressed IgM was lower in HIV+CN+ subjects than in HIV+CN- subjects (P = .02) and HIV- subjects (P &lt; .01); an IgM(+) memory B cell percentage of 38.5% was a significant predictor of future development of cryptococcosis (odds ratio, 14; P = .02).
There were 2767 uncontrolled asthmatics and 2912 controlled asthmatics. Adjusting for confounders, controlled asthmatics reported (P &lt; 0.001) higher physical and mental health-related quality of life scores (SF-8); fewer emergency room visits, hospitalization days, and medical provider visits; lower levels of overall work productivity loss and activity impairment.
: Risks for MetS in this manufacturing population are in a constant state of change. Changes in MetS status over time were associated with commensurate changes in health care, pharmacy, and short-term disability costs. Employees who reduced the greatest number of MetS risks over time had the largest cost decrease (-$437), whereas those who increased the greatest number of risks experienced the largest cost increase (+$1348).
The studied biomarkers were not able to discriminate between exposed and control individuals, but sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and high frequency cells were influenced by smoking habits. Smokers having fast microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity showed higher SCE frequency (7.61) respect to those presenting intermediate (5.86) or slow (6.65) enzymatic activity.
Self-report and administrative data showed greater concordance for monthly compared with yearly health care utilization metrics. Percent agreement ranged from 30% to 99% with annual doctor visits having the lowest percent agreement. Younger people, males, those with higher education, and healthier individuals more accurately reported their health care utilization and absenteeism.
Across all overweight and obese employees, 5% weight loss would result in a reduction in total annual costs (medical plus absenteeism) of $90 per person.
SRT and APE compared with REF showed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (approximately 6 mm Hg), body fat percentage (approximately 2.2 body fat%), as well as shoulder and back pain (approximately 30% reduction in duration). Muscle strength (APE and SRT) and maximal oxygen uptake (APE) increased approximately 10%.
VGDF was reported in 123 (53%) of 233 cases versus 577 (34%) of 1709 referents. VGDF was associated with COPD (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.5; 95% CI = 1.9 to 3.4); the population attributable fraction was 32%. In the lung function subset, the FEV1/FVC was &lt;70% in 79 (57%); 35 (44%) reported VGDF associated with an OR = 1.6 (95% CI = 0.99 to 2.6) and population attributable fraction 17%.
: Thirty-seven percent of the population engaged in the health assessments; however, participation varied widely by work area (10% to 83%) and by job type (17% to 56%). Participation was significantly correlated with selected aspects of job satisfaction.
The 27 most commonly reported symptoms were selected and grouped into five symptom categories. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity were found to be satisfying. Cluster analysis identified two subgroups of IEI to chemicals.
From 2004 to 2008, there were 16 new studies that met the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. These studies are critiqued and entered into a data table consisting of 13 variables and citations of the 16 new studies.
B. longum SPM1207 reduced serum total cholesterol and LDL levels significantly (p &lt; 0.05), and slightly increased serum HDL. B. longum SPM1207 also increased fecal LAB levels and fecal water content, and reduced body weight and harmful intestinal enzyme activities.
Our results showed that total n-3 PUFA was positively associated with weight gain (p = 0.05), height (p = 0.04) and body mass index (BMI) of children (p = 0.05). Our results also indicate that both linoleic acid and total essential fatty acids were positively associated with BMI and head circumference, whereas oleic acid was positively associated only with head circumference.
The NICU nurses identified a norm for formula feeding during their formative experiences as children. The nurses described increased exposure to varied feeding methods during their adulthood, but breastfeeding was often associated with difficulties among their families and friends. The nurses in this study recounted minimal exposure to breastfeeding in nursing school. The nurses' personal experiences with breastfeeding were laden with strong emotional reactions intertwined with their feelings about motherhood.
Major themes identified were in the area of beliefs, such as "They say" it's healthy, or "It hurts"; attitudes, such as breastfeeding is the mother's "choice" and "The baby comes first"; and concerns such as privacy, and "Breastfeeding leads to dependency."
Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r &gt; or = 0.80) when 3 days of data were used.
Using predictive models, focal seizures (OR 3.21; 95% CI 1.42-7.25, p = 0.005), cerebral malaria (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.20-4.91, p = 0.01) and a blood sugar &gt;or=200 mg/dl at presentation (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.11-7.20, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of treatment failure (seizure persistence beyond 10 minutes or recurrence within one hour of treatment). Predictors of seizure recurrence included: 1) cerebral malaria (HR 3.32; 95% CI 1.94-5.66, p &lt; 0.001), 2) presenting with multiple seizures (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.42-4.23, p = 0.001), 3) focal seizures (HR 2.86; 95% CI 1.49-5.49, p = 0.002), 4) recent use of diazepam (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.19-4.95, p = 0.01) and 5) initial control of the seizure with diazepam (HR 1.96; 95% CI 1.16-3.33, p = 0.01).
The MCP-1 levels in urine were significantly higher in patients in stable phase of the disease, compared with healthy controls. Patients in stable phase, with subsequent adverse events; had significantly higher MCP-1 values than patients who did not. MCP-1 and IgM both tended to be higher in patients relapsing within three months, an observation, however, not reaching statistical significance. Urinary levels of IL-6 correlated with relapse tendency, and IL-8 was associated with disease outcome.
Vasomotor symptoms were significantly associated with insomnia (P = 0.001). When depressive symptomatology was added to the logistic regression analysis, the predictive ability of the model was significantly improved as defined by the increase in the log likelihood (P &lt; 0.001) and the increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
The overall prevalence of dyspareunia in this population was 18%. Dyspareunia was somewhat lower among women aged 40 to 49 years (17%) than among those aged 50 to 59 years (21%), not reaching statistical significance. Dyspareunia was associated with educational attainment, employment status, menopause status, current hormone therapy use, genitourinary symptoms, and loss of libido (P &lt; 0.05). Current cigarette smoking, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol use, parity, and ever use of oral contraceptives were not associated with dyspareunia in bivariate analysis (P &gt; 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, incontinence (prevalence odds ratio [POR], 1.67; 95% CI, 1.02-2.73), vaginal dryness (POR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.49-6.31), vaginal itching (POR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.55-3.83), loss of libido (POR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.92-4.94), and partnership (POR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.29-3.82) remained associated with dyspareunia.
The incidence of hot flashes significantly increased compared with the incidence of depressed mood in the 10-year follow-up (P &lt; 0.001). Sixty-seven percent of the women reported hot flashes, 50% reported depressed mood, and 41% reported both symptoms during the study interval. Reporting of both hot flashes and depressed mood was greater than expected if the processes operated independently (P &lt; 0.001). Of the women who experienced both symptoms, depressed mood was more likely to precede hot flashes (relative risk = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-2.9). Within-woman increases in follicle-stimulating hormone levels were associated with the onset of depressed mood in unadjusted analysis (P = 0.05). Increased follicle-stimulating hormone levels, decreased inhibin B levels, and the variability of estradiol were significantly associated with hot flashes. Follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin B remained significantly associated with hot flashes in the final multivariable models (P &lt; 0.001).
On objective assessments, depressed women with VMS spent less time in bed (by 64.8 min; P &lt; 0.001) and had shorter total sleep time (by 47.7 min; P = 0.008), longer sleep-onset latency (by 13.8 min; P = 0.03), and lower sleep efficiency (by 3.2 percentage points; P = 0.09), but did not awaken more or spend more time awake after sleep onset than nondepressed controls with VMS. Depressed women also reported worse sleep quality (mean Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index 12.0 vs 8.3; P &lt; 0.001). Adjustment for VMS frequency and important demographic characteristics did not alter these associations.
Sixty (50.4%) of 119 participants demonstrated at least one immune abnormality. Both groups did not differ statistically in age, mean follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, and antimüllerian hormone levels, although antimüllerian hormone suggested a trend toward higher levels in autoimmune participants (P = 0.19). Autoimmune participants also demonstrated lower mean triple CGG expansion sizes (P &lt; 0.05) and included fewer women with greater than or equal to 35 triple repeats (relative risk, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.3-11.9; P &lt; 0.01), previously reported to demarcate increased risk for premature ovarian aging.
At baseline, HT and placebo groups were similar (P &gt; 0.05) in age (mean +/- SEM, 57 +/- 1 y), height (162 +/- 2 cm), weight (72 +/- 4 kg), VO2 peak (21.5 +/- 1.4 mL . kg . min), and all cardiovascular measures. Posttraining oxygen consumption and HR decreased (P &lt; 0.05) within groups during each submaximal exercise workload. Stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance remained unaltered (P &gt; 0.05). VO2 peak and oxygen consumption at the ventilatory threshold increased (P &lt; 0.05) within groups. Resting and postischemic blood flow were unaltered. HT did not influence any of the cardiovascular responses.
A total of 19,024 women were included in the analysis and 976 excluded; qualified rate is 95% (19,024/20,000). Of the Chinese women aged from 20 to 99 years (mean +/- SD, 45 +/- 16 y), the overall prevalence rate of UI was 30.9%. Estimates of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence, and mixed urinary incontinence prevalence were 18.9%, 2.6%, and 9.4%, with a corresponding proportional distribution of 61%, 8%, and 31%, respectively. The prevalence of mixed urinary incontinence increased with aging, whereas the prevalence of SUI peaked in the group of women aged 50 years and that of urge urinary incontinence in the group of women aged 70 years. Only 25% of women have consulted doctors on this issue. Through multivariable logistic regression analysis, we identified age, vaginal delivery, multiparity, alcohol consumption, central obesity (women's waist circumference, &gt;/=80 cm), constipation, chronic pelvic pain, history of respiratory disease, gynecological events, pelvic surgery, and perimenopause and postmenopause status as potential risk factors for SUI, among which age, vaginal delivery, and multiparity are three major risk factors.
After controlling for age, body mass index, daily calcium intake, serum vitamin D, serum parathyroid hormone, estrogen use, smoking status, and exercise status, bone density increased as the frequency of onion consumption increased. Individuals who consumed onions once a day or more had an overall bone density that was 5% greater than individuals who consumed onions once a month or less (P &lt; 0.03).
Among the basal values, only the ApoA-I level was significantly lower in the alendronate group (P &lt; 0.01). IMT measurement results (mean [SE]) of the alendronate group were 0.622 [0.015], 0.616 [0.014], and 0.597 [0.013] mm; those of the control group were 0.600 [0.010], 0.611 [0.011], and 0.620 [0.011] mm, respectively. In both groups, the difference between the start and 12-month values was significant (P &lt; 0.05). A significant difference was not determined in the triglyceride and lipid measurement results between the groups and also within groups. ApoA and ApoB levels at the start and the 12th month of the study were as follows: 159.8 [3.6], 162.2 [3.4] (P &gt; 0.05) and 96.2 [4.2], 101.5 [4.5] (P &gt; 0.05) in the control group and 145.1 [4.0], 173.7 [4.3] (P &lt; 0.05) and 98.7 [3.9], 84.6 [3.3] (P &lt; 0.05) in the alendronate group, respectively. The ratios of ApoB/ApoA-I were 0.611 [0.029] is to 0.636 [0.031] (P &gt; 0.05) in the control group and 0.703 [0.04] is to 0.498 [0.0] (P &lt; 0.05) in the alendronate group.
In all, 1,189 women with a mean age of 48.1 +/- 5.9 years were interviewed. Prevalence of any menopausal symptom was 84.5% during the 4-week period studied. Joint and muscular discomfort was the most common reported symptom among all women in this study (59.0%), followed by physical and mental exhaustion (43.0%), sexual problems (40.4%), and hot flashes (39.0%). Factors predicting the total score on the MRS were age of respondent (P = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.02-0.17), menopause status (P = 0.001; 95% CI, 0.33-1.24), and occupational group (P = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.10-1.42). Age of respondent and menopause status also predicted scores on the somatovegetative and urogenital subscales, but not on the psychological subscale. Occupation was the only predictor on the psychological subscale (P = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.16-0.75).
Efficacy was assessed at 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 weeks and included the change from baseline in the severity of the most bothersome symptom (MBS), maturation index, and pH. Most women identified vaginal dryness as the MBS (48%) followed by pain with intercourse (31.3%). A statistically significant increase in the maturation index and significant decreases in pH and severity of the MBS were observed for those treated with SCE-A vaginal cream compared with placebo.
Response to acute tryptophan depletion was variable and unexplained by use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiestrogens, breast cancer disease and treatment variables, or genetic polymorphisms in serotonin receptor and transporter genes. Contrary to our hypothesis, hot flashes were not worsened with acute tryptophan depletion.
At a bivariate level, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were inversely associated with regional and total body fat mass (P &lt; 0.05), whereas positive associations were observed with regional and total body fat-free mass (P &lt; 0.05). After controlling for age, serum intact parathyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor I levels, ultraviolet B radiation exposure, and physical activity levels, most of the associations observed at a bivariate level between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and body composition indices (as obtained by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) remained significant. No significant associations were observed between anthropometric indices of body mass and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
We found no association between memory complaints and performance on tests of retentive memory. However, memory complaints were associated with poorer memory encoding and increased depressive symptoms. Regression analyses revealed that memory complaints were best predicted by depressive symptoms, whereas encoding performance was predicted by depressive symptoms and estrogen level. Women with significant memory complaints performed worse on tests of encoding, after controlling for depression and sleep disturbance.
Fifty-one women participated in our study. By week 4, the difference in severity and frequency of hot flashes had become statistically significant between the treatment groups and the control participants. In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in Menopausal-Specific Quality of Life Scale scores between treatment group 2 and the other groups.
When tested with age as a measure of time, menopause-related covariates, including E1G, FSH, and testosterone, were associated with significant increases in overnight cortisol levels (P &lt; 0.0001). Likewise, epinephrine and norepinephrine were each associated significantly with overnight cortisol levels (P &lt; 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, E1G, FSH, and testosterone constituted the best set of predictors.
The mean age of participants was 66.7 +/- 6.8 years, and 89% (n = 2,448) were white. Sixteen percent (n = 434) of participants reported clinically significant hot flushes at baseline. Among women with baseline flushing, EPT increased risk of CHD events nine-fold in the first year compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 9.01; 95% CI, 1.15-70.35); among women without baseline flushing, treatment did not significantly affect CHD event risk in the first year (hazard ratio = 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86-2.03; P = 0.07 for interaction of hot flushes with treatment). The trend toward differential effects of EPT on risk for CHD among women with and without baseline flushing did not persist after the first year of treatment.
Initial analysis demonstrated high correlations between TT, BT, and FT levels (r = 0.776-0.855). However, there was no correlation with salivary T levels for any of the serum T subtypes (r = 0.170-0.261). After log transformation, salivary T correlated modestly with BT (r = 0.436, P &lt; 0.001), FT (r = 0.452, P &lt; 0.001), and TT (r = 0.438, P &lt; 0.001).
One hundred fifty-four (94%) of the 164 postmenopausal women who consented to the study were included in the final analysis. Fifty-one women had received the five-night course of tablets, 50 had received one tablet, and 53 were assigned to the group with no previous estrogen use. The odds of an atrophic smear were significantly lower in women who used the five-night estrogen regimen than in women who did not use estrogen. The estimated odds ratio of an atrophic smear in the five-night regimen was 0.01 (95% CI, 0.03-0.26) compared with the no-estrogen control group. Moreover, using one tablet of estrogen had no significant effect on the likelihood of an atrophic smear compared with using none. The odds ratio of an atrophic smear in the single estrogen tablet group was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.48-2.29) compared with the no-estrogen group.
Six of the plant extracts bound to the ERs. Four of the six extracts stimulated reporter gene expression in the ER-beta-Chemically Activated Luciferase Expression assay. All six extracts modulated expression of endogenous genes in MCF-7 cells, with four extracts acting as estrogen agonists and two extracts, Pimenta dioica and Smilax domingensis, acting as partial agonist/antagonists by enhancing estradiol-stimulated pS2 mRNA expression but reducing estradiol-stimulated PR and PTGES mRNA expression. Both P. dioica and S. domingensis induced a 2ERE-luciferase reporter gene in transient transfected MCF-7 cells, which was inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780.
At week 12, improvements in VMI with daily and twice-weekly use of low-dose CE cream (27.9% and 25.8%, respectively) were significantly greater compared with placebo (3.0% and 1.0%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Improvements in vaginal pH with daily and twice-weekly CE cream (-1.6 for both) were also significantly greater relative to placebo (-0.4 and -0.3, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). VMI and vaginal pH responses were sustained through 52 weeks. Both CE cream regimens significantly reduced most bothersome symptom scores compared with placebo (P &lt; or = 0.001), including those for dyspareunia (P &lt; or = 0.01). There was no report of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency among the active and placebo groups during the double-blind phase.
Participants had a mean age of 60 years and were mainly white (92%). Across time points, monitor hot flashes were (1) significantly more frequent than diary and/or event button flashes (P &lt; 0.05) and (2) moderately correlated with subjective measures (0.35 &lt; r &lt; 0.56). Monitor hot flashes did not significantly change over time with aromatase inhibitor therapy, whereas both diary and event button frequencies significantly varied but in dissimilar patterns (51% nonlinear). No consistent predictors of hot flashes across measures or time points were identified.
Higher anxiety at study entry predicted placebo response on all three outcome measures individually (flushing: R = 0.33, P = 0.03; depression: R = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001; and Greene Climacteric score: R = 0.24, P = 0.04); and in combination (P = 0.002), as did total Greene Climacteric scores at study entry (R = 0.24, P = 0.005). Improvement during nontreatment run-in predicted placebo response for depression (P = 0.005), menopausal symptoms (R = 0.28, P = 0.013), and the three combined endpoints (P = 0.015). Severity of scores at baseline predicted subsequent improvement on the Greene Climacteric scores only (r = 0.038, P = 0.009).
We enrolled and treated 60 patients; 22 were carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and 1 had a strong family history of BRCA-associated cancer but declined to undergo mutational testing. The olaparib dose and schedule were increased from 10 mg daily for 2 of every 3 weeks to 600 mg twice daily continuously. Reversible dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one of eight patients receiving 400 mg twice daily (grade 3 mood alteration and fatigue) and two of five patients receiving 600 mg twice daily (grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 somnolence). This led us to enroll another cohort, consisting only of carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, to receive olaparib at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. Other adverse effects included mild gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no obvious increase in adverse effects seen in the mutation carriers. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination; pharmacodynamic studies confirmed PARP inhibition in surrogate samples (of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and plucked eyebrow-hair follicles) and tumor tissue. Objective antitumor activity was reported only in mutation carriers, all of whom had ovarian, breast, or prostate cancer and had received multiple treatment regimens.
In both rabbits and monkeys, the time to detection of protective antigen correlated with the time to bacteremia (r=0.9, P&lt;0.001). In the therapeutic-intervention studies, the survival rate was significantly higher among rabbits that received raxibacumab at a dose of 40 mg per kilogram (44% [8 of 18]) than among rabbits that received placebo (0% [0 of 18]; P=0.003). Raxibacumab treatment also significantly increased survival in monkeys (64% [9 of 14], vs. 0% [0 of 12] with placebo; P&lt;0.001). In human subjects, intravenous raxibacumab at a dose of 40 mg per kilogram had a half-life of 20 to 22 days and provided a maximum concentration of the drug in excess of levels that are protective in animals. Concentrations of raxibacumab provide a surrogate end point that should be predictive of clinical benefit.
Rates of serious infection dropped significantly after the joint change to buccal misoprostol from vaginal misoprostol and to either testing for sexually transmitted infection or routine provision of antibiotics as part of the medical abortion regimen. The rate declined 73%, from 0.93 per 1000 abortions to 0.25 per 1000 (absolute reduction, 0.67 per 1000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.94; P&lt;0.001). The subsequent change to routine provision of antibiotics led to a further significant reduction in the rate of serious infection - a 76% decline, from 0.25 per 1000 abortions to 0.06 per 1000 (absolute reduction, 0.19 per 1000; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.34; P=0.03).
In Study 1, blocking autoantibodies were found in 17% of case mothers, as compared with 13% of control mothers (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 3.39), and binding autoantibodies in 29%, as compared with 32%, respectively (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.50). Study 2 showed similar results, indicating that sample degradation was unlikely.
We found PARP fragmentation, along with usual approximately 89 kDa and approximately 24 kDa fragments, into other fragments of different molecular weights. Caspase mediated cell death may lead to appearance of larger approximately 89 kDa fragment and smaller approximately 24 kDa fragment indicating existence of apoptosis in the tumors. However, other fragments corresponding to approximately 64 kDa, approximately 54 kDa, and approximately 40 kDa were observed concomitantly in all glial tumor tissues.
All the 37 patients received microsurgical resections, there was no surgery-related mortality. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cavernoma. Postoperatively, 20 patients had functional improvement, 15 patients had no change in the neurological status, and two patients deteriorated. Early surgery was associated with better outcomes. Mean followed up period was 21.5 months (range 6-36 months). During the follow-up 20 patients had resumed activities of daily living (KPS scores of 90-100), 10 patients were able to self-care with some efforts (KPS scores of 70-80), five patients needed considerable assistance (KPS score of 50-60) and two patients suffered hemiparesis (KPS scores of 40). None of the patient had recurrent hemorrhage.
The 'intrinsic' brainstem tumors were classified into three types: Expanding, diffuse infiltrative and pure ventral varieties. Only patients with expanding variety of brainstem gliomas were subjected to surgery, mean age 19.2 years (range 4-55 years) and male to female ration mean: 3:2). The tumor location included pons (n=19), midbrain (n=13) and medulla (n=8). Surgical approaches included midline suboccipital (n=28), retromastoid (n=7), subtemporal (n=3) and supracerebellar-infratentorial (n=2). Thirty-two cases with 'diffuse infiltrative' and 'pure ventral' variety were given radiotherapy only. Histology pathology revealed pilocytic variety (n=10), Grade II (n=17) and Grade III (n=13). There was one death in the surgical series (due to aspiration). Complications included meningitis (n=2), wound infection (n=1), chest infection (n=5) and transient mutism (n=1). Follow-up ranged from 3-68 months. Overall, 36 improved /remained same and three worsened in their clinical status at the time of discharge.
There were 12 cases of AMAN out of a total of 84 cases of GBS. All AMAN patients showed a characteristic pattern of hand weakness predominant weakness of finger extensors with relatively normal power in finger flexors, wrist flexors and extensors. Proximal limb weakness was mild and was present in 85% cases. One patient had cranial nerve palsy and one had hyperreflexia. None of the patients progressed to respiratory failure.
Elevated TP concentration and lower prealbumin were observed in almost 70% of the patients on admission, but this percentage was lower (52.4%) during the first week from onset of symptoms. Both variables were directly associated with the time of evolution of the disease and also with a greater clinical severity. Follow-up CSF studies showed higher CSF TP and lower prealbumin percentages, while deceased patients did not display this response pattern in the follow-up CSF.
The mean Ashworth score changed significantly (P = 0.00) for patients in the SR group from 3.03-2.69 (-0.35) and 3.07-2.70 (-0.37) for patients in the GRS group. There was no significant difference (P = 0.87) between baseline-adjusted Ashworth score reductions on SR (-0.35) and GRS (-0.37). Similar results were obtained for spasm, reflex, and functional independence scores. The mean baseline-adjusted patient-diary scores did not differ significantly between 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm, and 8 pm (P = 0.96), either on SR (-5.3 to -6.1) or GRS (-7.3 to -8.1), indicating a uniform effect round-the-day on both. Further, sedation scores (mean +/- SEM) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) on both SR (10.36 +/- 1.37 to 6.18 +/- 0.92) and GRS (8.14 +/- 1.57 to 5.33 +/- 1.11), suggesting better toleration.
The median dosage of gabapentin was 1800 mg/daily. Side effects were mild and transient. There was a statistically significant difference in both symptom SSS and FSS scores between before and after treatment in patient groups at the end of six months (P &lt; 0.001). According to grading the changes in subscales of BCTQ, of 41 patients, 34.1 and 29.3 had a &gt;or= 40% decrease in SSS and FSS, respectively.
The age range of the patients was 35 to 60 years (mean: 42.2 years). Mean +/- SD preoperative pain scores for ibuprofen or mesalamine-treated groups were 7.852 +/- 2.441 and 7.806 +/- 2.892, respectively. At the end of day 9, mean +/- SD of pain score was 2.704 +/- 2.284 and 2.717 +/- 2.273 for ibuprofen and mesalamine-treated groups respectively. Both drugs significantly reduced postoperative pain and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.
All the eight patients presented with low back pain and/or symptoms of infection, such as draining from the incision site, fever, and tenderness. The diagnosis was confirmed by the imaging findings on MRI with gadolinium enhancement.
Examples of the metaphorical expressions and words used described the service as a 'secure rock in a changing world'; transition was felt as 'sadness', a 'betrayal', with feelings that the changes were 'bitter and twisted;' and left 'a black hole'. Post transition the mood had changed to acceptance 'When life throws lemons at you, you make lemonade'.
Here, we demonstrated that treatment with cisplatin in fission yeast causes a Chk1-dependent DNA damage signal. chk1(-) cells were sensitive to cisplatin and Chk1 was phosphorylated in response to cisplatin treatment. We also showed that a Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway is activated in a dose-dependent fashion in cells challenged with cisplatin. Furthermore the Cds1 checkpoint kinase was also important for viability in cisplatin challenged cells. In cds1(-) cells, cisplatin treatment reduced cell viability and this phenotype was exacerbated in a chk1(-)/cds1(-) background.
We explored these polymorphisms with real-time polymerase chain reaction in a case-control study (184 white women with preeclampsia and 184 matched normotensive pregnant women). Endothelial dysfunction biomarkers including von Willebrand factor, VCAM-1 and thrombomodulin, as well as the soluble form of CX3CL1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The I249 and M280 alleles were associated neither with preeclampsia, nor with its more severe form or with endothelial injury. In contrast, we found a trend toward increased CX3CL1 levels in preeclampsia patients, especially in early-onset- preeclampsia as compared to its level in later-onset- preeclampsia.
In this study, various temporal discrepancies between visual and tactile stimulations were introduced by using a visual feedback delay experimental setup, and RHI effects in each temporal discrepancy condition were systematically tested. The results showed that subjects felt significantly greater RHI effects with temporal discrepancies of less than 300 ms compared with longer temporal discrepancies. The RHI effects on reaching performance (proprioceptive drift) showed similar conditional differences.
Size matched fragments containing the polyadenylation signal of the human beta-actin gene (ACTB) and the human beta-globin gene (HBB) were evaluated for transcription termination using this new ratiometric tandem reporter assay. Constructs bearing just 200 base pairs on either side of the consensus poly(A) addition site terminated 98% and 86% of transcription for ACTB and HBB sequences, respectively. The nearly 10-fold difference in read-through transcription between the two short poly(A) regions was eclipsed when additional downstream poly(A) sequence was included for each gene. Both poly(A) regions proved very effective at termination when 1100 base pairs were included, stopping 99.6% of transcription. To determine if part of the increased termination was simply due to the increased template length, we inserted several kilobases of heterologous coding sequence downstream of each poly(A) region test fragment. Unexpectedly, the additional length reduced the effectiveness of termination of HBB sequences 2-fold and of ACTB sequences 3- to 5-fold.
Here, we investigate the role of mTOR signaling in the regulation of HIF-1alpha stability in primary GBM-derived cells maintained under hypoxia (2% oxygen). We found that GBM cells, when acutely exposed to high oxygen tension, undergo Akt/mTOR pathway activation and that BMP2 acts in an analogous way. Importantly, repression of Akt/mTOR signaling is maintained by HIF-1alpha through REDD1 upregulation. On the other hand, BMP2 counter-acts HIF-1alpha stability by modulating intracellular succinate and by controlling proline hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) protein through inhibition of FKBP38, a PHD2 protein regulator.
In order to clarify this issue, we backcrossed the coilin deletion onto the C57BL6/J background for ten generations and then investigated the consequences of coilin removal on overall viability and reproductive success. We conclude that semi-lethal phenotype observed in mixed-background crosses is due to loss of the Coilin gene (or a very tightly-linked locus). Interestingly, coilin knockout embryos die relatively late in gestation, between E13.5 and birth. We show that the maternal contribution of coilin is not important for organismal viability. Importantly, coilin knockout mice display significant fertility and fecundity defects. Mutant males that escape the embryonic lethality display reduced testis size, however, both males and females contribute to the observed reduction in reproductive fitness.
LBD-NGF could specifically bind to laminin and maintain NGF activity both in vitro and in vivo. In the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model, we found that LBD-NGF could be retained and concentrated at the nerve injury sites to promote nerve repair and enhance functional restoration following nerve damages.
We targeted a region of 19'980 bp encompassing the RPS19 gene in a cohort of 89 DBA and TEC patients for resequencing. We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1).
To address the requirement of IL-6 during disease induction, IL-6 deficient mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CB3). Following infection, mice lacking IL-6 developed increased chronic autoimmune disease pathology compared to wild type controls without a corresponding change in the level of viral replication in the heart. This increase in disease severity was accompanied by elevated levels of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-10, activated T cells and cardiac infiltrating macrophage/monocytes. Injection of recombinant IL-6 early following infection in the IL-6 deficient mice was sufficient to lower the serum cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-10 as well as the serum chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1beta, RANTES and MIG with a corresponding decrease in the chronic disease pathology strongly suggests an important regulatory role for IL-6 during the early response.
The motor behavior was examined by the open field actimeter and the neuronal activity of basal ganglia nuclei was investigated using extracellular single unit recordings on urethane anesthetized rats. We show that alpha-flupentixol induced EPS paralleled by a decrease in the firing rate and a disorganization of the firing pattern in both substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Furthermore, alpha-flupentixol induced an increase in the firing rate of globus pallidus (GP) neurons. In the striatum, we recorded two populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) after their antidromic identification. At basal level, both striato-pallidal and striato-nigral MSNs were found to be unaffected by alpha-flupentixol. However, during electrical cortico-striatal activation only striato-pallidal, but not striato-nigral, MSNs were found to be inhibited by alpha-flupentixol. Together, our results suggest that the changes in STN and SNr neuronal activity are a consequence of increased neuronal activity of globus pallidus (GP). Indeed, after selective GP lesion, alpha-flupentixol failed to induce EPS and to alter STN neuronal activity.
Gene deletion revealed that pik1 is essential. In cells with pik1 deleted, ectopic expression of a loss-of-function allele, created by fusion to a temperature-sensitive dihydrofolate reductase, allowed normal cell proliferation at 25 degrees C. At 36 degrees C, cells arrested with abnormally thick, misplaced or supernumerary septa, indicating a defect late in septation. In addition to being Golgi associated, ectopically expressed GFP-tagged Pik1 was observed at the medial cell plane late in cytokinesis. New alleles, created by site-directed mutagenesis, were expressed ectopically. Lipid kinase and Cdc4-binding activity assays were performed. Pik1(D709A) was kinase-dead, but bound Cdc4. Pik1(R838A) did not bind Cdc4, but was an active kinase. Genomic integration of these substitutions in S. pombe and complementation studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae pik1-101 cells revealed that D709 is essential in both cases while R838 is dispensable. In S. pombe, ectopic expression of pik1 was dominantly lethal; while, pik1(D709A,R838A) was innocuous, pik1(R838A) was almost innocuous, and pik1(D709A) produced partial lethality and septation defects. The pik1 ectopic expression lethal phenotype was suppressed in cdc4(G107S). Thus, D709 is essential for kinase activity and septation.
We analyzed skin biopsies of normal controls (n = 24), patients with SSc (n = 30) and c-GVHD with dermal fibrosis (n = 133)). Immunostaining was employed to identify vessels, vascular smooth muscle, dermal matrix, and cell proliferation. C-GVHD and SSc had similar dermal matrix composition and vascular smooth muscle pathology, including intimal hyperplasia. SSc, however, differed significantly from c-GVHD in three ways. First, there were significantly fewer (p = 0.00001) average vessels in SSc biopsies (9.8) when compared with c-GVHD (16.5). Second, in SSc, endothelial markers were decreased significantly (19/19 and 12/14 for VE cadherin and vWF (p = &lt;0.0001 and &lt;0.05), respectively). In contrast, 0/13 c-GVHD biopsies showed loss of staining with canonical endothelial markers. Third, c-GVHD contained areas of microvascular endothelial proliferation not present in the SSc biopsies.
Of patients with affective/schizophrenic/alcohol-related mental disorders, 153/143/145 (89/86/91%), respectively, completed the TTO elicitation; 29/43/28% of the respondents were zero traders. The mean TTO utility was 0.66/0.75/0.61 and the median was 0.85/0.95/0.75. TTO utility scores discriminated well among more impaired mental health states, but discrimination was limited among less impaired health states. In patients with affective and alcohol-related mental disorders, TTO utility scores were significantly correlated (mostly moderate: 0.3 &lt; r &lt; 0.5) with all other scores. However, in schizophrenic patients, TTO utility scores were only a little correlated with other subjective measures and not correlated with objective measures. QOL was significantly associated with zero trade; the influence of the other variables on zero trade was negligible.
A total of 34,942 patients (27.78% of all patients with cSSSIs) were treated with vancomycin. Mean age was 54.7 years and 54.3% of the patients were males. Mean unadjusted total LOS was 8.46, 9.44 and 13.2 days, and hospital costs in 2005 values were USD10 211.94, USD12 361.94 and USD18 344.00 for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In-hospital mortality rate was highest in group 3 (4.18%) and lowest in group 1 (1.75%). Generalized linear models used to control for potential confounding variables between early versus late vancomycin use suggest that among cSSSI patients late vancomycin use is an independent predictor of higher LOS and costs.
The relative risk of developing oral submucosal fibrosis was highest with gutka-chewing habit (relative risk, 1,142.4), which was significant (P &lt; .01) at 95% confidence interval. The next highest relative risk for development of oral submucosal fibrosis was observed for the combination of gutka with other chewing habits. The relative risk of developing submucosal fibrosis increased with the frequency of chewing habit up to 15 times daily with a duration of habit up to 4 years. The relative risk decreased with chewing frequency beyond 15 times daily and 4 years in duration. Logistic regression and discriminative analysis show that chewing areca nut and gutka, especially daily, greatly influence the development of submucosal fibrosis.
Most pulps showed moderate to severe inflammatory responses. Hard tissue formation appeared at 14 to 30 days. Positive bacterial staining was observed in most specimens in experimental groups. The histological changes in the pulps of the experimental groups were more pronounced than in the control group. Differences in inflammatory response, tissue disorganization, and hard tissue formation were observed among teeth treated with the three self-etching systems.
Statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks showed that the dual-cured composite light polymerized 1 minute after placement exhibited the lowest microleakage (P &lt; .05) in both bonding agent groups.
Eight patients had 1 graft, and 6 patients had 2 grafts harvested from their palate. Twelve patients had never noticed any dysfunction. Two patients reported a persistent numbness or a rough palatal surface. Statistically significant differences between donor sites and nondonor sites were shown by 2-point discrimination 5 mm from the margin of canines (6.57 mm +/- 3.79 mm at donor sites and 4.71 mm +/- 4.14 mm at nondonor sites, P = .01). Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences between donor sites and nondonor sites for measurements taken 5 and 10 mm from the margin of all included teeth (P = .02).
The density of fibrous connective tissue was significantly higher after 30 days in both groups (P &lt; .001). Congestion, hemorrhage, calcification, and swelling of the odontoblasts were similar in both groups. The total capillary area was significantly higher after 7 and 30 days in both groups. Positive immunoreactions for iNOS were found in 1 case (20%) of the 30-day Scotchbond group. Immunoreactions for IFN-gamma were positive in a few cells in 1 case (20%) of the 7-day Clearfil group. There were no positive immunoreactions for TNF-alpha in any case.
The study dentifrice showed a significant reduction in VMI in relation to the initial situation (P = .009). There were also significant differences in VMI values between the 2 dentifrices (P = .010). VMI differences were not significant for either dentifrice when analyzed by gender, tobacco use, and toothbrushing frequency before starting the study.
In subjects with papilla recession, the longer the bone crest-contact point distance, the greater the mean papilla height in all study groups except the narrow-long group. Significant correlations were found between papilla height and bone crest-contact point distance in subjects with recession.
The mean marginal gaps were measured as follows (CRE/EDM/control): position 25: 0.0 microm/1.0 +/- 1.6 microm/1.5 +/- 2.1 microm; position 23: 5.2 +/- 5.6 microm/18.7 +/- 29.3 microm/23.6 +/- 30.7 microm; and position 21: 36.0 +/- 21.6 microm/40.7 +/- 31.0 microm/46.0 +/- 41.1 microm. The only statistically significant difference was found at location 23 between group CRE on one side and both group EDM and control on the other side. The strong increase of misfit for group CRE from location 23 to location 21 indicates that laser welding is the crucial parameter in this technique.
The recovery time to normal ambulation after intrathecal injection was significantly faster with procaine than with the other 3 drugs at all concentrations. There were no significant differences in the sensory threshold among the 4 anesthetics. Histologic damage was observed only in rats treated with greater than 16% prilocaine or mepivacaine or with greater than 4% bupivacaine. Histologic damage occurred at the posterior root and posterior white matter and was characterized by axonal degeneration. Rats treated with procaine, even at 20%, showed no histologic abnormalities.
The block using chloroprocaine followed by bupivacaine in group 1 had an onset of 2.5 mins (SD, 0.4 mins) and duration of 104 mins (SD, 16 mins). Adding epinephrine to both chloroprocaine and bupivacaine (group 2) did not significantly change the onset (2.8 mins [SD, 1.3 mins]; P = 0.35) or duration (110 mins [SD, 25 mins]; P = 0.23). With group 3, adding bicarbonate to chloroprocaine hastened the onset (1.2 mins [SD, 0.4 mins]; P &lt; 0.0001) and shortened the duration (87 mins [SD, 13 mins]; P = 0.008). In group 4, adding bicarbonate and epinephrine to chloroprocaine and epinephrine to bupivacaine hastened the onset (1.4 mins [SD, 0.4 mins]; P &lt; 0.0001) and increased the duration (130 mins [SD, 23 mins]; P &lt; 0.0001).
A total of 520 fascicles were quantified, of which 134 were in contact with the needle trajectories. The numbers of fascicles and vessels per section were 65 +/- 8 and 14 +/- 7, respectively. A mean of 16 +/- 5 fascicles were found in contact with the needle trajectory (group A: 17+/- 3, group D: 15 +/- 6). Of these, 4 fascicles (3.2%) and 1 intraneural vessel were found damaged in group D. No fascicular or vascular injuries were found in group A.
Forty patients (52%) obtained a positive outcome. In multivariate analysis, preprocedure pain intensity, age older than 65 years, and pain radiating below the knee were significant predictors of failure. A trend was noted whereby patients receiving regular opioid therapy were more likely to experience a negative outcome. The use of cooled, rather than conventional RF, was associated with a higher percentage of positive outcomes.
The minimum effective anesthetic volume in 50% and calculated effective volume in 95% of patients were 23 mL (95% confidence interval, 13-39 mL) and 42 mL (95% confidence interval, 19-65 mL), respectively. Seven patients received supplemental LA, with no patient requiring a general anesthetic.
Of the 2301 surgical procedures amenable to a regional technique, 839 (36.5%) involved use of regional anesthetic, and 1462 (63.5%) involved only a general anesthetic. Of the subjects receiving RA, 32% were performed by general anesthesiology faculty, and 68% were performed by regional anesthesiology faculty. The most common type of regional anesthetic performed by the general anesthesiology faculty was neuraxial blockade (95.2%) (vs 52.5% by regional anesthesiology faculty). Of the cases not involving RA, the reasons were anesthesiology related (40%), surgeon related (34%), patient related (12%), and medical contraindication related (14%).
Seventy-two sessions performed by 24 residents were recorded. Manual Skill Checklist and Global Rating Scale total scores were compared across the 2 study groups at baseline (first epidural), middle (31-90 epidurals) and late (&gt;90 epidurals) time points using independent-samples t tests. No significant differences in scores were detected at either one of these time points.
In the mid-infraclavicular area, the lateral cord always lies anterior to either the posterior or the medial cord and cranial to the axillary artery; the posterior cord was always cranial to the medial cord; and both cords were always located dorsal to the artery. In the clinical study, in 98% of the included patients, finger flexion or finger and/or wrist extension was elicited as predicted. The overall success rate was 92%. No vascular or lung puncture occurred.
A total 17 of volunteers were investigated. The ED50 volume was 0.08 mL/mm (SD, 0.01 mL/mm), and the ED95 volume was 0.11 mL/mm (SD, 0.03 mL/mm). The mean cross-sectional area of the nerves was 6.2 mm (1.0 mm).
The placement of local anesthetic by LOR was accurate in 45% of attempts but was superficial and deep to the rectus sheath in 34% and 21% of punctures, respectively. Accurate placement of local anesthetic within the rectus sheath decreased significantly as body mass index increased. Ultrasound guidance significantly improved the accuracy of needle placement, with 89% of abdominal punctures being correctly placed at the time of first injection of local anesthetic. An additional fascial plane lying at variable distance above the anterior layer of the rectus sheath was commonly observed.
There were 5436 consecutive peripheral noncatheter block cases (interscalene, axillary, femoral, sciatic, popliteal) during the 28-month period surveyed, with 3290 guided by landmark-nerve stimulation, and 2146 by ultrasound-nerve stimulation. Eight adverse outcomes occurred among patients having blocks guided by landmark-nerve stimulation technique, including 5 seizures and 3 nerve injuries. There were no such occurrences in the ultrasound-nerve stimulation group. When comparing the 4 brachial plexus block-related seizures that occurred with landmark guidance versus none with ultrasound guidance, the associated risk of seizures reached statistical significance (P = 0.044 by Fisher exact test). There was no difference between the 2 groups in the number of seizures occurring with lower extremity blocks, or in the frequency of neurologic injury.
At 30 mins, the block was complete in 72% of participants in group US as compared with 22% in group LM. At all times, the proportion of complete blocks was higher in group US. Ultrasound-guided blocks took longer on average to perform than traditional blocks (159 vs 79 secs; P &lt; 0.001). There were more needle redirects in group US, with 8 subjects requiring 3 or more redirects versus none in group LM. Subjects preferred the US block 78% of the time (95% confidence interval, 52%-95%).
All patients showed reduction of strength, and 28 of 30 or 93% met the criteria for successful block with mean strength reduction of 82.2% (SD, 21.6%) at 15 mins. Blocks were completed in 122 secs (SD, 33 secs).
Ultrasound allowed visualization of the LFCN in the cadaveric specimen on both sides and in all but 1 volunteer. Ultrasound-guided block of the LFCN was successful in all but 1 volunteer. The mean distance of LFCN from the anterior iliac spine was 2.9 cm on the right side and 2.8 cm on the left side. The mean duration of the block was 4.4 hours.
On the measurements performed, the notch was found to be deeper in men than in women on both the right (P = 0.022) and the left (P = 0.011) sides. Taking all volunteers into account without grouping sex, no differences were detected between the two sides with respect to the measurements of the notch width, notch depth and distance between the skin and the notch base. The superior transverse scapular ligament was demonstrated in 48 (96%) of 50 volunteers. On color Doppler ultrasound, the artery-vein complex was visualized in a total of 43 (86%) volunteers.
For the abdominal wall, registration was not able to be achieved with five fiducial markers, and was successfully achieved in all cases with either six or seven fiducial markers. For the anterolateral thigh, registration was achieved with either nine or ten markers. The four patients who also underwent surface-landmark registration and 'Z-touch' laser surface matching registration all failed the registration process.
Superior hypogastric plexus, which deviated to left, located in a triangle formed by the common iliac arteries and its bilateral branches, its truck sited anterior to the lumbarsacral space in seven cases (70%), and anterior to sacrum in three cases (30%); at the aortic bifurcation, SHP strided over left iliac artery from left-hand side, then located in front of sacrum in four cases (40%), and sifted to the left at the lumbar sacral promontory in six cases (60%); from both anatomic and histological view, the autonomic nerve plexus lying in an fascia layer of retroperitoneum.
Five different connection types between the accessory nerve and the posterior roots of the cervical nerves were recorded and photographed (types A-F). One of these types was not described previously in literature (type F). All connections between the posterior roots of the C2-C6 spinal nerves and the accessory nerve were at the level of the C2 segment. Type B was the most frequently seen type in our series. One of the rootlets of the cervical posterior root joined the accessory nerve without a connection to the spinal cord in type B.
A 3D model of human liver and its surrounding structures was built. The reconstructed structures can be displayed singly, in small groups or as a whole and can be continuously rotated in 3D space at different velocities. This model can help doctors to understand the spatial structure of the liver and its surrounding organs and also help surgeons to devise a reasonable surgical plan and reduce the risk of surgical malpractice.
Towards a drug-design approach, the 3D model of the Usutu virus helicase structure has been designed, using conventional homology modelling techniques and the known 3D-structure of the Murray Valley Encephalitis virus helicase, of the same viral family, as template. The model was then subjected to extended molecular dynamics simulations in a periodic box, filled with explicit water molecules for 10 nanoseconds. The reliability of the model was confirmed by obtaining acceptable scores from a variety of in silico scoring tools, including Procheck and Verify3D.
The carotid and femoral IMT separately and in combination were found to be correlated with the FHS risk score, calculated based on either the total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein plasma levels (carotid IMT: r = 0.28, p = 0.035, and r = 0.35, p = 0.007, respectively, femoral IMT: r = 0.38, p = 0.003, and r = 0.43, p = 0.001, respectively, carotid-femoral IMT: r = 0.37, p = 0.005, and r = 0.46, p = 0.0001, respectively). In addition, femoral IMT was found to be correlated with the carotid IMT (r = 0.41, p = 0.001).
After 3 months patients in the treated group had reached target cholesterol values (LDL cholesterol = 2,34 +/- 0.9 mmol/l), whereas no significant change in lipids was observed in the control group. The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) did not change significantly in either group. After 3 months the pain-free walking distance was increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001), but similarly in both groups (at entry: 56 (53-108) m vs 53 (53-106) m; after 3 months: 79 (53-108) m vs 106 (66-159) m, for the treated and placebo group, respectively). Therefore this effect had to be attributed to regular exercise and not to statin use.
In the retrospective analysis, where no systematic screening for thromboses was performed and only symptomatic thrombosis was recorded, venous thrombosis was found in 6.6% of all tumour patients, whereas in the prospective examination with systematic duplex sonography and / or venography of all patients, the percentage was 33%. In the prospective study, 31.3% of venous thromboses were symptomatic and 68.7% asymptomatic. In 39.3% of the cases in the retrospective analysis and 25% in the prospective analysis, venous thrombosis occurred during chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy. Venous thrombosis was most often seen in metastasizing tumours and in colorectal carcinoma (40%), haematological system diseases (28.6%), gastric cancer (30%), bronchial, pancreas and ovarian carcinoma (28.6%), and carcinoma of the prostate (16.7%).
There were 18 patients (12.9%) suffering from thrombophlebitis in association with a malignant tumor: breast cancer in seven patients, colon carcinoma and haematologic cancer in four, skin cancer in three patients and one case each of oesophageal, prostatic, kidney and neck cancer . In two patients thrombophlebitis preceded the diagnosis of the malignancy. Superficial thrombophlebitis may have been associated in four cases (2.9%) with a benign tumor.
A higher degree in clinical severity of CVD was related to shorter venous refilltime (VRT) and lower venous pump power (VPP) measured by DPPG. The strength of dorsiflexion was significantly reduced in group C6 compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between measurements of DPPG and the strength of dorsiflexion and also with total strength (p &lt; 0.05). In limbs with pathological reflux (&gt; 1 s) the strength of dorsiflexion, range of ankle plantarflexion movement and total range of ankle movement were significantly reduced compared to those without pathological reflux (p &lt; 0,05). Strength of plantarflexion was significantly reduced in group C1/2 compared to control group (p &lt; 0,05).
5 cases of patients with colorectal bleeding were performed using this technique with cessation of bleeding in 4/5 initial attempts. 1 patient required a repeat angiogram that did demonstrate the bleeding on the second attempt allowing superselective angiography and embolization that resulted in cessation of bleeding. This patient with a rectal bleed required selection of additional vessels guided by the marker on the second attempt.
Compared with the controls, DCs stimulated with CpG ODN represented enrichment in cell surface protrusions and rough endoplasmic reticulum, decreased or disappeared vacuole. The expressions of HLA-DR, CD86, and CD80 were much higher in DCs stimulated with CpG ODN than those in complete medium control (P&lt;0.05). When culturing in complete medium, the expressions of HLA-DR, CD86, and CD80 were much lower in CHB patients and HBV carriers than healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). The expressions of HLA-DR and CD86 stimulated with CpG ODN were much lower in CHB patients than HBV carriers and healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). The expressions of CD80 were much lower in CHB patients and HBV carriers than healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). The levels of IL-12 were much higher in DCs stimulated with CpG ODN than that in complete medium controls (P&lt;0.05). The levels of IL-12 in complete medium or medium added with CpG ODN were much lower in CHB patients and HBV carriers than in healthy controls (P&lt;0.05).
Neurologic impairment scores at 2 h, 1 d, 2 d, and 3 d of the model group and the treatment group were obviously higher than the sham-operation group (P&lt;0.01), and those at 2 d and 3 d of the treatment group were obviously lower than those of the model group (P&lt;0.05). The number of apoptosis cells and the expression of caspase-3 protein in the model group significantly increased compared with those in the sham-operation group (P&lt;0.01), while those in the treatment group was significantly lower than the model group (P&lt;0.01). Bcl-2 protein expression in the model group increased more obviously than that in the sham-operation group (P&lt;0.01), and that in the treatment group was much higher than the model group (P&lt;0.01). The EL time of the model group was much longer than that of the sham-operation group and the number across platform was obviously decreased compared with that of the sham-operation group (P&lt;0.01), while the EL time of the treatment group was much shorter than that of the model group and the number across platform was more than that of the model group (P&lt;0.05).
The tumors in 52 cases ruptured. Rupture hemorrhoea first occurred in 45 patients before admission and in 7 during hospitalization. Twenty-six patients suffered from recurrent or multiple hemorrhoea while in hospital. Forty-nine patients received external iliac artery-superficial femoral artery extra-anatomic bypass reconstruction with banded vascular grafts and the other 14 received ligation operations of the external iliac artery or the femoral artery. No one died in the perioperative period. One patient with vascular graft reconstruction developed graft infection during hospitalization and 5 developed graft infection during the follow-up. No ischemic necrosis occurred in the affected limbs after the infected vascular grafts were removed. One patient developed necrosis in the affected limb after the femoral artery was ligated and then above-knee amputation was performed. The others recovered well. Unobstructed blood circulation in the vascular graft was exhibited by color Doppler ultrasonography in 36 cases during the follow-up.
A 2-DE reference map of NPC was established. On the 2-DE map, a total of (1 312+/-30) protein spots were detected, and 427 protein spots representing 241 non-redundant proteins were identified. The 2-DE database of NPC proteome was constructed. These data could be accessed at our website (http://www.xyproteomics.org).
There was no significant difference in left ventricle end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricle ejective fraction (LVEF), and fractional shortening (FS) between pre-operation and pre-pacing. LVEDD [(44.71+/-3.35) vs. (38.01+/-1.54) mm] and left ventricle end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) [(25.63+/-1.86) vs. (10.58+/-1.23) mmHg] at 4 weeks after pacing significantly increased compared with the pre-pacing data(P&lt;0.05). LVEF, FS, and LV dp/dt max were significantly declined (P&lt;0.01).
Most RPCs expressed Notch1 intracellular domains or its downstream transcriptional factor Hes1. A few expressed bHLH transcriptional factors NeuroD and Mash1. Most auto-differentiated RPCs expressed NeuroD or Mash1, while a few of them expressed Notch1 intracellular domains or Hes1. In the group treated with gamma-secretase inhibitor X, the positive rate of Nestin or GFAP was much lower than that in the control group while the positive rate of beta-tubulin was much higher than that in the control group. The difference in the positive rate of recovering between the two groups was not significant.
We detected GJB2 mutation in 56 out of the 140 patients (40%, 56/140). Both of the 2 alleles were mutated in 29 patients and 1 allele in the other 27 patients, and the rate of allele mutation was 30.4%(85/280). Ten variations were detected, including 7 mutations and 3 polymorphisms. The deaf-causing mutations were nonsense mutation c.139G&gt;T; frameshift mutation c.235delC and c.176-191del16; and missense mutation c.109G&gt;A, c.344T&gt;G, c.550C&gt;T and c.571T&gt;C. The unreported missense mutation was c.344T&gt;G. The c.235delC mutation was the most prevalent mutation found in the 27 patients (19.3%, 27/140). The frequency of c.109G&gt;A mutation was next to c.235delC found in 25 patients (17.9%, 25/140).
(1) One month after the disaster, and the positive rate of PTSD screening in these survivors was 35.56%, the positive rate in women was significantly higher than that in men (chi(2)=16.27,P&lt;0.001). The positive rate of PTSD screening in Group A, Group B and Group C was 39.15%, 31.82%, and 16.67%, respectively, with significant difference (chi(2)(mh)=5.243,P&lt;0.05). Among the three groups which met the diagnosis criterion of PTSD symptoms, the scores for "numbness/avoidance symptom"and "excessive arousing symptom"in Group A were significantly higher than those in Group B and C (P&lt;0.01). (2) The scores for "anxiety"and "depression"and "psychosomatic"symptoms in Group A and Group B were significantly higher than those in Group C (P&lt;0.05). (3) Gender, place of residence and evacuating from the earthquake area or not were factors of PTSD symptoms.
An A-C transversion was found at position 1 126 in NCAM's 7 exon in a patient with glioblastoma from 43 astrocytoma.
Evident apoptotic morphological changes of Raji cells were observed 24 hours after treatment with As(2)O(3) or ADM. Compared with As(2)O(3) or ADM alone, As(2)O(3) combined with ADM could increase the inhibition ratio significantly (P&lt;0.05), and the inhibition rate was related to the concentration and action time of As(2)O(3) (P&lt;0.05). Compared with As(2)O(3) or ADM alone, As(2)O(3) combined with ADM could increase the apoptosis rate of lymphoma cells with obvious difference (P&lt;0.05). Semi-quantitive and RT-PCR showed that the expression of mutant p53 in As(2)O(3) and ADM alone and combined groups was obviously less than that in the control (P&lt;0.05). After the treatment with 1 micromol/L and 2 micromol/L As(2)O(3), the fluorescene density in the Raji cells was 18.53 and 18.12, 0.056 and 0.023 times increase respectively.There was no difference (P&gt;0.05).
Characteristic features at the presentation of AITL included generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, splenomegaly, and skin rashes with polyclonal hyper-gammaglobulinemia and other hematological abnormalities (such as Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia), which often involved the bone marrow and had well-described histologic features. The positive rate for CXCL13 was 93.3%.
Effective rate of chemotherapy was 86.6% which was associated with clinical stage and histology. Eight-four patients received radical hysterectomy. The histological grade of 17 patients was lowered, lymph nodes in 19 patients were positive, and 6 patients had parametrium invasion. One patient died within 1 year after the operation, and 5 patients recurred.
The mRNA expression level of NMBR in the PT group was significantly higher than that in the NP, EP, LP and PP groups (P&lt;0.05), but this difference was not observed in the MP group (P&gt;0.05). The NMBR protein in PT group was significantly higher than that in the other 5 groups (P&lt;0.01). NF-kappaB-P65 DNA binding activity at PT group was remarkably higher than that in the NP, LP and PP groups (P&lt;0.05). The expression of IL-6 mRNA was significantly higher than that in the NP, LP and PP groups (P&lt;0.05), its protein expression in PT and LP groups was significantly higher than that in the NP and PP groups (P&lt;0.05). The expression of HSP70 mRNA in the PT group was significantly higher than that in the NP and PP groups (P&lt;0.05), and the protein of HSP70 was significantly up-regulated in PT and PP groups compared with in NP and LP groups (P&lt;0.05). The DNA-binding activity of P65 was positively correlated to the mRNA expression of NMBR and IL-6 (r=0.40, P&lt;0.01; r=0.30, P&lt;0.05), so were positively correlated to DNA-binding activity of P65, mRNA expression of HSP70 and NMBR ( r=0.40, P&lt;0.01; r=0.49, P&lt;0.01). DNA-binding activity of P65 did not correlate with the mRNA expression of HSP70.
We detected qacA/B in 19 out of the 80 MRSA strains (23.75%) and qacB in 18 out of the 80 MRSA strains (22.5%). Compared with sequences of qacA (NO.X56628) and qacB(NO.AF535087) in the Genbank, 98% and 97% were identical, respectively.
The spectra wave shapes of SVC flow velocity in the PAH group were distinguished from those of the control. The peak velocity and VTI of S waves during inspiration and the rate of respiratory changes of peak velocity of SVC flow Doppler velocity in moderate and severe PAH groups were significantly lower than those of the control (P&lt;0.05).The peak velocity and VTI of D waves of SVC flow Doppler velocity in the PAH groups were significantly lower than those of the control (P&lt;0.05). The rate of respiratory changes of peak velocity of D waves in the PAH groups was significantly lower than those of the control (P&lt;0.05). The peak velocity and VTI of AR, and VR waves of SVC flow Doppler velocity in the PAH groups were significantly higher than those of the control (P&lt;0.05). Linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between pulmonary arterial systolic pressure(PASP) and the Vexp/Vins ratio (r=0.760, P&lt;0.001).
NOS, NO, and FMD in the 2 groups 24 hours after the PCI were significantly lower than those before the PCI(P &lt; 0.05), but hs- CRP obviously increased (P &lt; 0.05). NOS, NO, and FMD 3 months after the PCI in the 2 groups were significantly higher than those before the PCI (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01), but hs-CRP obviously decreased (P &lt; 0.01).All indexes mentioned above in the Tongxinluo group showed greater changes than those of the conventional group(P &lt; 0.05). NO was negatively correlated with hs-CRP (r = -0.3219, P&lt;0.01).
Huangqi Fuzhengtang could obviously elevate the contents of hemolysin, IL-2, INF-gamma and the ratio of CD4(+) and CD8+, which was more effective than Yupingfeng San.
Serum adiponectin levels were negatively related to BMD at the whole body, the lumbar spine, the hip, and the forearm (r = -0.181, r = -0.208, r = -0.228, r = -0.203, and P &lt; 0.05, respectively). After adjustment for age and fat mass, the correlation with BMD still remained (r = -0.131, r = -0.140, r = -0.159, r = -0.172, and P&lt;0.05, respectively). Serum leptin levels were positively related to BMD was at the hip and the forearm (r = 0.162, r = 0.210, and P &lt; 0.05, respectively). After adjustment for age and fat mass, the correlation with BMD at the forearm remained (r = 0.157, P&lt;0.05), but the correlation with BMD at the hip disappeared. In the multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, year since menopause, lean mass, adiponectin, and estradiol were independent predictors of BMD at the body, the hip and the forearm; year since menopause, lean mass, body mass index, adiponectin, and extradiol were independent predictors of BMD at the lumbar spine.
BMD at lumbar, neck and trochanter sites of the 35 patients after the treatment was significantly increased compared with those before the treatment (P&lt;0.05). Urine Ca/Cr level was decreased (P&lt;0.05). There was no severe side effect.
Ethnic groups did not differ significantly in stated willingness to participate in genetic research; more than 70% in each group were willing to participate. Among Blacks and Hispanics, mistrust and wariness, and stigma were significantly increased in those unwilling to participate; for Whites, perceived benefit to society and perceived importance for knowledge/education were associated with willingness to participate. For Blacks and Hispanics, youth (aged 18-29 years) and college education reduced, but did not eliminate the association between wariness and mistrust and willingness to participate.
Procedures performed were coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, 10 patients), aortic valve replacement+ CABG, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, left ventricular thrombus removal, and aortic valve reconstruction(one patient each). Eleven patients survived; three patients died perioperatively, one from sepsis (25 days after surgery), one from recurrent stroke (28 days after surgery), and one from multiorgan failure following perioperative stroke (31 days after surgery). In one patient, all bypass grafts occluded intraoperatively.Three patients underwent cardiac surgery under continuous anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. In these three patients, no perioperative thromboembolic events occurred. At a mean follow-up of 32 months,three patients had suffered from cerebral stroke, two from graft occlusion, of which one was recurrent. Two more patients had died (one after cerebral stroke and one from cerebral metastases of a renal cell carcinoma).
Including the learning curve, overall early mortality from 1989 to 1999 after the Norwood procedure was 39.06%. This decreased tremendously for the last seven years, and reduced to 12.8% in 2000 to 2003 until 0% in 2004 to 2006 (p &lt; 0.005). The causes of mortality were sepsis, capillary leak,or heart failure. Three patients died between stages II and III. One patient underwent heart transplantation after the second stage because of heart failure. Among 34 Norwood survivors, four are slightly tachypneic from a mild pulmonary hyperperfusion; one presents symptoms of minimal brain disease.
All patients underwent a modified Bentall operation with a mechanical (87%) or biological (13%) valve prosthesis and coronary artery button reimplantation. The overall 30-day mortality was 4.3% (six patients). Three patients (2.2%) underwent rescue coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left, right, or both coronary arterial systems for ischemia due to presumed coronary button misalignment. These patients presented with ventricular arrhythmias or hemodynamic compromise. All three showed excellent response to rescue CABG and remain alive and well in late follow-up.
Parathyroid incidentalomas were identified in 14 patients based on pathology and 10 patients based on elevated FNA-PTH. The occurrence of parathyroid incidentalomas was 0.4% (24=6496) on thyroid US. For the detection of the incidentalomas, the positive predictive value (PPV) of thyroid US was 21.4% (24=112). When an inadequate specimen was considered as being of nonparathyroid origin, the sensitivity of FNAB was 41.7%, specificity was 97.7%, accuracy was 85.7%, PPV was 83.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 86% in 112 patients. The diagnostic performance of FNA-PTH in 18 operated nodules showed a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 100%, accuracy of 94.4%, PPV of 100%, and NPV of 80%. Four patients noticed symptoms related to hyperparathyroidism after FNA-PTH analysis.
BPO in concentrations of 2.5%, 5% and 10% are equally effective at treating inflammatory acne. However, higher concentrations are associated with more adverse effects. The efficacy of BPO may be enhanced by the presence of Vitamin E and tertiary amines. BPO is also more efficacious if used in combination with topical retinoids than as a monotherapy. Novel vehicles including a microparticle delivery system and those with a hydrophase or urea base increase the tolerability of BPO without sacrificing efficacy.
Of the 1003 people 225 (22.6%) had NAFLD with higher prevalence among males 164/565 (29%) than among females 61/438 (13.9%). In the NAFLD group normal body mass index (BMI) was present in only 49/225 (20%) of the subjects while 119/225 (52.8%) were overweight and 56/225 (24.8%) were obese. Though liver enzymes were normal the mean AST among cases was 37.41 +/- 14.50 and 33.93 +/- 14.15 among controls and the mean ALT was 38.74 +/- 17.96 among cases and 31.62 +/- 13.49 among controls. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 106/225 (47%) among cases and 179/778 (23%) among controls.
Eighty seven percent had NAFLD on histology with 62.6% steatohepatitis and 37.3% fibrosis. Age, duration of diabetes mellitus, degree of glycemic control, body mass index, waist circumference, family history of diabetes mellitus, did not predict the presence or severity of NAFLD or fibrosis. Serum alanine aminostranferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase levels, though within normal limits, were significantly higher in patients with steatohepatitis. Prevalence of NASH increased with increase in the components of the metabolic syndrome. Serum AST/ALT ratio were also significantly higher (p-0.049) in patients with severe fibrosis. All patients with severe fibrosis had metabolic syndrome.
Transplantation represented a significant source of hope. Fear of transplant failure was a major concern, but was dealt with by using emotion-focused coping mechanisms. Graft rejection was devastating, causing feelings of grief, loss, suicide, and depression. Depression improved as physical health and a sense of personal control improved. The recipient felt inadequately prepared for graft failure and poorly supported by health professionals.
The parents described their experiences in positive terms, yet acknowledged hardships. Key themes included (1) constantly responsible, (2) constantly worried, (3) constantly blessed, and (4) coping with life. The identified themes provide direction for interventions to help parents cope with the experience of parenting a child after heart transplant.
Key focus areas in optimizing medical management before liver transplant were identified with the aim of preventing disease progression and complications that would jeopardize patients' outcome. Clinical practice guidelines were developed for each key area to optimize care by promoting appropriate timing of clinical interventions.
Caregivers reported favorable levels of quality of life, physical health, and mood during the pretransplant waiting phase. However, problem areas for caregivers during this time included fatigue, depression, and the financial impact of the transplant. Data analyses indicated that depression, caregiver general health, impact on finances, and lack of family support had the greatest effect on caregivers' quality of life. Nurses are urged to recognize the role of caregivers in the transplant process, ask about and listen to caregivers' needs, and include caregivers in the plan of care.
Median log-transformed antibody responses were similar in consecutive seasons in lung transplant subjects. Incidences of seroprotection and seroconversion did not differ between consecutive seasons in lung transplant recipients.
Overall, PLNS scores were satisfactory in all 4 categories. Analysis of PLNS subscales revealed significantly lower scores in the quality of life/psychosocial subscale compared with the other 3 subscales. Significantly lower scores in the medications and follow-up categories of the PLNS items were found among the group whose length of stay was between 15 to 30 days compared with patients with shorter and longer stays. A variety of different methods are desired by patients in order to get information, especially before transplant.
Four themes emerged as participants described the behaviors they developed to adhere successfully to the immunosuppressive medication required for maintaining their transplanted kidneys. The themes were reminder methods, obtaining medications, maintaining routines, and problem-solving strategies. Kidney transplant recipients identified the importance of developing and maintaining medication-taking skills and routines on medication adherence. Problem-solving abilities were also valuable during times of disruption of normal routines.
Most (85.6%) of next of kin were exposed to at least 1 source of donation information that was important to them, although the types of donation information they were exposed to varied widely. White and educated adults were more likely to have been exposed to more donation information than had minorities and persons with less education. Favorable attitudes and beliefs about organ donation, donor designation, and sharing donation intentions with others were all associated with more exposure to different types of donation information. Donation consent was more likely when next of kin had been exposed to more donation information in the months preceding the family member's death.
The RAPiD hospital evaluations revealed gaps in respondents' knowledge of organ donation, brain death, and referral criteria; a reluctance to declare brain death; and a rocky relationship between the hospitals and the organ procurement organization. As a result of the interventions, 9 hospitals' environments for organ donation improved, 7 showed no change, and 1 was worse.
Seventy-two patients on hemodialysis participated, 45 men (62.5%) and 27 women. The crude OR in DSE score was 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 3.0) and adjusted odds ratio was 2.51 (95% CI: 0.99 to 6.34).
Complete necrosis of skin flaps occurred in 1 case, congestion and necrosis over the edge of skin flaps occurred in 3 cases, which were healed after grafting, and other skin flaps survived well with soft texture. Skin flaps were too bulky in 26 cases, among them 17 cases were thinned, and the appearance of other skin flaps were satisfactory. In 68 patients with functional region injury were recovered to certain extent without contracture.
Sixty skin flaps survived completely, partial necrosis occurred in 3 flaps, and complete necrosis in 2 flaps. There was no obvious difference in average survival rate among local skin flaps (95.2%), distant pedicled skin flaps (88.8%), and free skin flaps (92.3%, P &gt; 0.05).
All skin flaps survived, except in one patient in whom a small belb appeared at the distal end of the island flap with anterior cutaneous branch of transverse cervical artery, and it was healed after a few dressing changes. The functions and appearances were satisfactory after 6-month to 2-year follow-up, without showing secondary deformity.
All wounds were healed primarily except vascular crisis occurred in 3 cases, partial necrosis of skin at donor site in 2 cases, and graft site (1 case). Follow-up for 3 to 24 months of 31 patients showed: six cases received two-stage plastic operation on account of bulkiness with trouble in wearing shoes, and mild contraction of muscular flap in 3 cases.
All flaps survived wells except in 4 patients necrotic area (length 2-5 cm, width 1-2 cm) appeared in the distal wound edge, localized dehiscence of wound edge in 2 cases, which were healed after dressing change or secondary suturing. Patients were followed up from 6 months to 3 years, and the appearance and function were satisfactory.
Flaps in 55 cases survived. Patients were followed up 3-6 months, there was no complication, and they were healed with satisfactory texture and appearance. The patients could walk normally, but with unsatisfactory sensory recovery. In one patient, the flap was broken and ulcerated 1 month after operation on account of leaving behind necrotic tibia. It was healed after second operation.
The contractive responses of SMA and VSMC after hypoxia were first increased, then decreased. Hypoxia induced calcium overload in VSMC [(82 +/- 4)% in normal control group, (115 +/- 8)% in hypoxia group at 30 min, (133 +/- 13)% in hypoxia group at 2 h]. Cx40 ASODN increased [Ca2+]i in VSMC and contractive response of SMA towards myricetin, while that of Cx43 ASODN showed opposite tendency.
(1) Compared with those in S group, the plasma level of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 lowered in T and Th groups (P &lt; 0.05), especially in T group, while those in G group showed no obvious difference (P &gt; 0.05). (2) Compared with those in G group, the level of TREM-1mRNA and its protein in hepatic tissue in T and Th groups decreased (P &lt; 0.01), especially in T group. (3) The survival rate of mice in S and G group was 16%, which was obviously lower than that in T and Th groups (76%, 44%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). (4) The survival rate of mice at 1, 2, 4, 6 hours after injection was 72%, 56%, 40%, 16%, respectively, while all that except at 6 hour after injection were higher significantly than that of control (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01).
The serum level of TNF-alpha in S group peaked on 1 PBD (30.9 +/- 8.7) ng/L, which showed statistically significant difference when compared with that of SB and T groups (12.7 +/- 2.8) ng/L, (16.8 +/- 4.7) ng/L, respectively, P &lt; 0.01), then lowered gradually to become similar to that of SB group on 7 PBD. The level of TNF-alpha in T group increased gradually, but was obviously lower than that of S group on 1, 4, 7 PBD (P &lt; 0.01). The level of sFasL in S (on 7-14 PBD) and T (4-10 PBD) groups was significantly higher than that in SB group (P &lt; 0.05), then lowered to normal level. The levels of sFas on 4-10 PBD in T group were obviously higher than that in S and SB group (P &lt; 0.05). Ratio of sFasL to sFas in serum of S group was higher than that in SB group on 7, 10 PBD, which was higher than that in T group on 7 PBD (P &lt; 0.05). There was significant decrease in serum level of insulin in S group compared with that of SB group on 4-10 PBD (P &lt; 0.05). The level of insulin in T group increased on 1 PBD, peaked on 4 PBD (327 +/- 15 microU/mL), which was significantly higher than that in SB and S groups (42 +/- 15, 28 +/- 10 microU/mL, respectively, P &lt; 0.01), then decreased gradually to normal level.
Compared with that of HC group (22 +/- 20 s), water maze escape latency in B, D, B + D groups on 2 day after training prolonged (38 +/- 31, 41 +/- 36, 42 +/- 33 s, respectively, P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). Water maze escape latency in B + D group on 4th day after training was longer than that of other groups (P &lt; 0.01). There was no obvious difference in positive expression of NMDA in CA1, CA2 regions among groups (P &gt; 0.05). The positive count of NMDA in dentate gyrus in D group (198 +/- 14) and B + D group (191 +/- 6) were lower than that of HC group (224 +/- 23, P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01), but there was no obvious difference between HC group and B group (219 +/- 25, P &gt; 0.05).
With stimulation of 10.0 ng/mL TGF-beta 1, the expression of CTGF was obviously higher than that of non-stimulation (P &lt; 0.05). Expression of alpha-SMA in the CTGF group and the TGF-beta 1 group was obviously higher than that in NC group (P &lt; 0.01), while there was no obvious difference among NC, CTGF ASODN, CTGF ASODN + TGF-beta 1 groups (P &gt; 0.05). The positive cell rate of alpha-SMA in NC, CTGF, TGF-beta 1, CTGF ASODN, CTGF ASODN + TGF-beta 1 groups was (10.8 +/- 2.8)%, (29.1 +/- 4.0)%, (28.7 +/- 4.8)%, (10.7 +/- 2.3)%, (14.3 +/- 2.9)%, respectively, which was similar to expression of alpha-SMA on statistic analysis.
Compared with those of HC group, plasma levels of LPS and TNF-alpha in LPS group significantly increased at 2nd PIH (18,320.50 +/- 2782.50 EU/mL and 988 +/- 130 ng/L, respectively), then decreased gradually to 1.80 +/- 0.80 EU/mL and 150 +/- 44 ng/L at 72nd PIH, which was close to those of HC group. The values of IL-6, ALT and AST peaked at 12th PIH, which declined to the levels close to those of HC group at 72nd PIH. Meanwhile, the expressions of TLR4, TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA in liver were remarkably up-regulated after injection, and the pathological changes in hepatic tissue pronounced significantly at 12th, 24th and 48th PIH. Compared with those of LPS group, the levels of LPS, cytokines, ALT and AST decreased in MP-1 group in different degrees after injection (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01), genes expression (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) and pathological changes was respectively suppressed and alleviated in hepatic tissue.
The TER of monolayers in H group at 6, 8, 12 and 24 h was 422 +/- 17, 427 +/- 27, 403 +/- 40 and 426 +/- 22 ohms respectively, which was significantly lower than that of NC group (451 +/- 27 ohms, P &lt; 0.05). The TER of monolayers in T group was 558 +/- 110 ohms, which was significantly higher than that in H group at each time point ( P &lt; 0.01). The ZO-1 of monolayers in H group at 6 h was irregular in arrangement, with interruptions and rugae, and sawtooth. These abnormalities were ameliorated in T group (regular in arrangement, with little or without ruga and sawtooth). The protein expressions of p-MLC and MLCK in H group at each time point were higher than those in NC group.
The incidence in the Super 14 competition (96.3 injuries/1 000 player-match hours; 95% confidence interval (CI) 69.0 - 111.7) was significantly higher (p = 0.003) than that in the Vodacom Cup (71.2; CI 60.0 - 84.5); injury severity was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.001) in the Super 14 (mean 13.4 days; median 5) than the Vodacom Cup (mean 21.2; median 12). There were no significant differences between the two competitions in type or location of injury: lower limb muscle/ tendon (Super 14: 27.8%; Vodacom Cup: 25.7%) and joint (non-bone)/ligament (Super 14: 18.8%; Vodacom Cup: 24.3%) were the most common injuries. Injury causation was similar for the two competitions but there were significantly fewer ruck/maul (p = 0.001) and more tackled (p = 0.010) injuries in Super 14 compared with English Premiership rugby and fewer collision (p = 0.002) and more tackling (p &lt; 0.001) injuries compared with Rugby World Cup. In the Vodacom Cup, there were significantly more tackling (p &lt; 0.001) injuries compared with Rugby World Cup.
Between January 2004 and December 2005, 479 men underwent vasectomy at Karl Bremer Hospital, Western Cape, South Africa; their average age was 36.1 (range 21 - 66) years, they had a median of 2 (range 0 - 10) children, and only 19% had 4 or more children. The average operation time was 15.5 (range 5 - 53) minutes. Complications occurred in 12.9%; these were pain (7.3%), swelling (5.4%), haematoma (1.3%), sepsis (1%), difficulty locating the vas (1%), vasovagal episode (0.6%), bleeding (0.6%), wound rupture (0.4%) and dysuria (0.2%) (some men had more than one complication). Of the men 63.3% returned for one semen analysis and 17.5% for a second. The vasectomy failure rate ranged from 0.4% (sperm persisting &gt; 365 days after vasectomy) to 2.3% (sperm seen &gt; 180 days after vasectomy and/or in the second semen specimen). No pregnancies were reported. The complication (5.6%) and failure rates (0%) were lowest for the registrar who had performed the smallest number of vasectomies and whose average operation time was longest. Comparing the first one-third of procedures performed by each of the doctors with the last one-third, there was a significant decrease in average operating times but not in complication rates.
Results of 41 females were removed from the statistical analysis because their results were suggestive of possible anaemia. Full blood count reference interval comparison confirmed gender-specific differences in red blood cell and platelet parameters. Ethnic-specific differences were found for some red blood cell parameters in the black female cohort. In addition, black males and females both generally had lower neutrophil and higher lymphocyte counts than a combined Asian/Caucasian/coloured ethnic group.
Over a 5-month period 143 children presenting with gastroenteritis were recruited. Stool samples obtained from 128 study subjects were tested for the presence of rotavirus; 45% were aged between 3 and 9 months (mean age 10.85 months), and 48 stool samples (37.5%) tested positive for rotavirus. The incidence of rotavirus infection was 20% higher in boys than in girls, a gender difference confirmed elsewhere in West Africa. The prevalence of rotavirus-positive stools peaked in August, coinciding with the rainy season. About 90% of the rotavirus-positive patients had severe diarrhoea, as opposed to only about two-thirds of the patients whose diarrhoea was not caused by rotavirus; this difference was statistically significant.
In JBM, 109 case-patients were investigated. Of the 57 case-patients eligible for immunisation, 27 (47.4%) were vaccinated. Fourteen (12.8%) case-patients were HIV infected, 46 (42.2%) were HIV uninfected, and 49 (45.0%) had unknown HIV status. Among children aged 12-59 months, vaccine effectiveness was 85% (95% confidence interval (CI): 63, 94) for all children, 63% for HIV infected, 75% for HIV uninfected, and 96% for children with unknown HIV status. (Confidence intervals were not calculated for sub-groups owing to small sample size.) In O. R. Tambo district, 157 case-patients were investigated. Among the 138 case-patients eligible for immunisation, 41 (29.7%) were vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness was 89% (95% CI 77, 95).
Incremental cost per outpatient was R1 280, and per inpatient R5 802. Costs were dominated by medical staff costs (62% inpatient and 58% outpatient, respectively). Infections predominated among diagnoses and costs--55% and 67% respectively for inpatients, and 49% and 54% respectively for outpatients. Most inpatients and outpatients were judged by attending physicians to have improved or stabilised as a result of treatment (52% and 59% respectively).
After controlling for demographics, chronic diseases, health behaviours and levels of folate and vitamin B12, the beta coefficient (which represents the change of natural-log-transformed levels of CRP for each kg/m2 increase in BMI) was 0.078 (p &lt; 0.001). The CRP levels also increased across increasing quintiles of BMI (p for trend &lt;0.001). The beta coefficient, representing the change of natural-log-transformed levels of CRP comparing subjects with central obesity to those without, was 0.876 (p &lt; 0.001).
Thirty-four per cent of the hospital's workers had metabolic syndrome, the same percentage were at high risk of developing metabolic syndrome, 28.7% were obese, and 27.3% were overweight. Female gender was found to be strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. The age group of 35-54 years was most affected.
The lifetime prevalence for any disorder was 30.3%, and the most prevalent 12-month and lifetime disorders were the anxiety disorders. The Western Cape had the highest 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates, and the lowest rates were in the Northern Cape.
Of respondents with a mental disorder, 25.2% had sought treatment within the previous 12 months; 5.7% had used any formal mental health service. Mental health service use was highest for adults with mood and anxiety disorders, and among those with a mental disorder it varied by province, from 11.4% (Western Cape) to 2.2% (Mpumalanga). More women received treatment, and this was largely attributable to higher rates of treatment in women with mood disorders. Age, income, education and marital status were not significantly associated with mental health service use. Race was associated with the treatment sector accessed in those with a mental disorder.
The estimate for cumulative occurrence of alcohol use was 38.7%, of tobacco smoking 30.0%, of cannabis use 8.4%, of other drug use 2.0%, and of extra-medical psychoactive drug use 19.3%. There were statistically significant associations between male gender and alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other drug use. Coloureds and whites were more likely than blacks to have used alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. Clear cohort variations existed in the age of initiation of drug use; these were most marked for other drugs and for extra-medical drug use. Use of all drug types was much more common in recent cohorts, with a similar cumulative incidence of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use across age cohorts.
The prevalence of major depression was 9.7% for lifetime and 4.9% for the 12 months prior to the interview. The prevalence of depression was significantly higher among females than among males. The prevalence was also higher among those with a low level of education. Over 90% of all respondents with depression reported global role impairment.
Recent negative life events and relationship problems were significant predictors of any 12-month disorder and any lifetime disorder. Physical partner violence predicted any lifetime disorder. There was evidence of specificity for the prediction of mood versus anxiety disorders, with childhood adversity specifically associated with mood disorders but not anxiety disorders. Single marital status was the strongest socio-demographic predictor of any 12-month and any lifetime disorder.
12-month and lifetime mood, anxiety and substance use disorders.
In the multivariate analyses, acute and chronic racial discrimination were associated with an elevated risk of any 12-month DSM-IV disorder when adjusted for socio-demographic factors, but this association was no longer statistically significant when adjusted for other sources of social stress. In fully adjusted models, acute racial discrimination was associated with an elevated risk of lifetime substance use disorders. Acute and chronic non-racial discrimination were associated with an elevated risk of 12-month and lifetime rates of any disorder, even after adjustment for other stressors and potentially confounding psychological factors. The association of chronic non-racial discrimination and 12-month and lifetime disorder was evident across mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders in the fully adjusted models.
HRV perpetrators were more likely to be male, black and more educated, while perpetrators of domestic violence (DV) were more likely to be female, older, married, less educated and with lower income. HRV perpetration was associated with lifetime and 12-month anxiety and substance use disorders, particularly PTSD. Purposeful and DV perpetration were associated with lifetime and 12-month history of all categories of disorders, whereas accidental perpetration was associated most strongly with mood disorders.
The presence of any DSM-IV-defined disorder during the previous 12 months was associated with previous HIV testing, increased HIV-related fears, and high levels of perceived risk of HIV. There were no associations between depression, anxiety and substance abuse disorders and appropriate forms of behaviour change for HIV risk reduction. However, individuals with an anxiety or a depressive disorder were more likely to report inappropriate forms of behaviour change. For example, individuals with any depressive and/or anxiety disorders were 1.57 and 1.47 times more likely, respectively, to report avoiding certain social situations to prevent HIV/AIDS compared with those who did not have such disorders (p &lt; 0.01 for both associations).
Using 49 variables extracted by principal component analysis as objective variables, we determined that there were correlations between the following combinations: arthralgia, A/G ratio and PeCDF level, ophthalmological symptoms such as excessive eye discharge and PCB level, and total cholesterol, inferior gingival pigmentation and PCQ level.
A total of 290 clusters were found with 290 index cases and 411 secondary cases. Of the 290 index cases, the biggest number of patients was 58 for the forties, followed by 43 patients for the twenties and the fifties. Of the 411 secondary patients, the biggest number of patients was 91 for the twenties, followed by 58 patients for the thirties, and 158 patients or 38.4% belonged to the young generations. High YGRs were found in the young and middle-aged generations ranging from 37.5% to 75.0%, while YGRs were low in the elder generations ranging from 15.9% to 26.7%. The difference was significant between the fifties and the sixties (p&lt;0.01). The YGRs were calculated 57.1% for the young generations, 43.5% for the middle-aged generations, and 18.9% for the elder generation. The differences were significant between the young and the middle-aged (p&lt;0.05), as well as between the middle-aged and the elder (p&lt;0.001). The biggest SGR was calculated 42.2% for the twenties. Low SGRs were 18.2% for the forties and 17.5% for the fifties. The differences were significant between the twenties and the forties (p&lt;0.01), as well as between the twenties and the fifties (p&lt;0.01). The secondary patients aged 0 to 29 were counted 158: 123 were transmitted through intra-familial infection and 35 were through extra-familial infection. The major index case generation was the middle-aged generations with 82 or 66.7% secondary patients in the case of intra-familial infection, while it was the young generations with 20 or 57.1% patients in the case of extra-familial infection.
71.3% (7406/10378) of contacts completed 2 years follow-up radiograph screening. There were 54 secondary cases. Characteristics of 38 index cases of contact groups were compared by the rate of causing secondary cases. Results showed that the following characteristics were statistically significant in causing secondary cases: sex (male: 5.6%, female: 1.8%, chi2 test; p&lt;0.05), age (49 or less: 6.8%, 50-64: 5.7%, 65 or over: 0, p&lt;0.01), chest radiography (cavitary: 6.0%, non-cavitary: 2.0%, p&lt;0.05), initial AFB smear grade (G5 or over: 6.5%, G4 or less: 2.2%, p&lt;0.01), cough duration (2 months or more: 7.0%, less than 2 months: 2.8%, p&lt;0.01), transmission risk index (10 or over: 8.4%, 0.1-9.9: 3.4%, 0: 0, p&lt;0.001). As initial part of contact investigation, decision was made for each group whether TB secondary transmission was "likely" or "unlikely". If it was considered as "likely", TST was conducted for contacts. Incidence rate of secondary case was 0.44% in groups TST was conducted, and 0.09% in groups TST was not conducted. The difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). According to tuberculin results, 760 persons in 215 groups were given LTBI treatment. Comparing the number of secondary cases in the age group of 10-39 eligible for LTBI treatment, 19 secondary cases were detected immediately or 2 months after the initial contact examination, and it was reduced to 7 cases after 6 months to 2 years. However in the age group of 40 and over not eligible of LTBI treatment, the number of secondary cases increased from 10 immediately or 2 months after the initial contact examination to 18 after 6 months to 2 years, and the difference was statistically significant (p&lt; 0.01).
The results of hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed 55% of the variance in intentions to leave. "orientation as nurse", subjective health status influenced by psychological job demand, and "supervisor support" were important independent factors of intentions to leave. Psychological job demand and job readiness were also important factors of subjective health status.
Bivariate and multivariate analysis indicated that women who had good childbirth experiences had positive feelings concerning motherhood and parenting stress and anxiety were lower. Bivariate analysis also indicated that childbirth experience had an inverse relationship with postnatal depression.
The number of ambulance responses per a population sample of 1000 people was 1.32 cases in adults (men 1.55, women 1.11) and 10.48 cases in elderly adults (men 9.14, women 11.32). The proportion of outdoor falls for adults was 60.8%, for women and 56.8% for men. The respective values for elderly adults were 54.9% and 36.6%. The majority of elderly adult women fell down indoors. More falls occurred in winter (from December to February) than in the other seasons. There were more falls in December than other months.
Growth and development are two major aspects of children not readily apparent in adults. Clearance in the pediatric population should be investigated using models that describe size, maturation and organ function influences. Glucuronide conjugation (hepatic phase II process) mirrors glomerular filtration maturation over the first year of life. Phase 1 processes appear more rapid, and differences attributable to single nuclear polymorphisms may be obvious by the end of the 4-week neonatal period in term infants.Pharmacodynamic differences in infancy remain poorly defined, and neonatal pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses that might elucidate such differences are few, partly because of a paucity of effective pharmacodynamic measures.
Haemodynamic data did not differ among times. No statistically significant differences were observed for the levels of DNA damage in WBCs, nor in plasma MDA, among the four times.
Mean bolus consumption, compared with control group, was significantly less in all groups (P &lt; 0.01). Intraarticular + subacromial group utilized fewer boluses compared with subacromial group and significantly lower boluses than intraarticular group (P &lt; 0.01), but IBPB group utilized significantly fewer boluses than intraarticular + subacromial group. Patients in IBPB, intraarticular + subacromial and subacromial groups showed VAPSs that were significantly better than that of the control group at all time points (P &lt; 0.01). The VAPS in intraarticular + subacromial group was statistically comparable with those in IBPB and subacromial groups at each time interval. IBPB and intraarticular + subacromial groups showed comparable patient satisfaction scores.
Baseline IMT was significantly associated with age (p &lt; 0.001), male gender (p = 0.034), current smoking status (p &lt; 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p &lt; 0.001) and total:HDL cholesterol ratio (p = 0.004), but not statin use (p = 0.904) and CD4 count (p = 0.929). IMT progression was significantly associated with age (p &lt; 0.001), male gender (p = 0.0051) and current smoking status (p = 0.011), but not statin use (p = 0.289) and CD4 count (p = 0.927). FMD progression was significantly associated with current statin use (p = 0.019), but not CD4 count (p = 0.84). Neither extent nor progression of FMD was significantly associated with any of the examined vascular risk factors.
When overall effectiveness, effectiveness in acute mania, or effectiveness in maintenance treatment was considered, lithium carbonate had the highest total utility score. When effectiveness in acute bipolar depression was considered, lamotrigine had the highest total utility score. When considering only atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole was associated with the highest total utility score for all iterations of the MADM.
Significant differences were found between workplace-treated patients and community-treated patients. Workplace-treated patients had overall adherence rates that were 9.72% higher than those of community-treated patients. This pattern was repeated with an overall adherence rate that was 9.52% higher for workplace-treated patients when prescriptions were limited to medication new starts.
Values for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides were not significantly different from baseline to follow-up. High-density lipoprotein values did significantly increase over the study period. Only 34% of statin prescriptions were considered appropriately converted to equipotent or higher potency doses. The mean time to documentation of statin conversion was 2.9 months.
These analyses included 1867 patients (972 randomized to the intervention group and 875 to the control group) and their 436 PCPs. During 10 months following the intervention, the median MPRs were 74% (interquartile range [IQR], 19%-93%) for the intervention group and 73% (IQR, 0%-93%) for the control group (P = .18). The median times until medication discontinuation after the intervention were 85 days (IQR, 58-174 days) for the intervention group and 79 days (IQR, 31-158 days) for the control group.
The proportions of each study group compliant with all tests were 18% to 19% among controls, 21% for a letter or a call, 25% for a letter-call or call-letter, and 26% for a letter-call-letter; letter-call and call-letter were significantly different versus controls (P &lt;.001), and letter-call-letter was not significantly different versus letter-call. Older age was associated with compliance (P &lt;.001).
Adherent beneficiaries were less likely to have a hospitalization (0.4 percentage points), had fewer hospitalizations (13%), had in excess of 2 fewer inpatient days (25%), were less likely to have an emergency department (ED) visit (3%), and had fewer ED visits (10%) than nonadherent beneficiaries. Total healthcare costs were $5910 (23%) less per year for adherent beneficiaries compared with nonadherent beneficiaries. The relationship between medication adherence and healthcare costs was graded. For example, beneficiaries with adherence rates of 95% or higher had about 15% lower healthcare costs than those with adherence rates between 80% and less than 95% ($17,665 vs $20,747, P &lt;.01). The relationship between adherence and total healthcare costs was even more stark when the most adherent beneficiaries were segmented into finer subgroups.
We identified 327,629 new users of drug therapy. The proportion starting generic therapies ranged from 9% (hypothyroidism) to 45% (hypertension). After 1 year, 66.2% of individuals with hypothyroidism achieved an MPR &gt; or = 80% compared with 53.4% with hypertension, 53.2% with hypercholesterolemia, 52.0% with diabetes, and 42.2% with seizure disorders. Generics were associated with greater adherence than brands in patients with hypercholesterolemia or diabetes (P &lt;.05). Lower adherence was seen in patients with hypertension or hypothyroidism (P &lt;.05). There was no difference in seizure disorders. The likelihood of achieving an MPR =80% with $0 copayments compared with $1 to $9 ranged from an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 1.32 for seizure disorders (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41, 1.43) to an AOR of 1.45 for hypothyroidism (95% CI = 1.43, 1.48).
Concurrent medication adherence ranged from 35% to 95% depending on the definition applied. Interval-based measures provide lower estimates than prescription-based techniques. Definitions that require the use of at least 1 drug class categorize virtually all patients as adherent. Requiring patients to have a PDC of at least 80% for each of their drugs results in only 30% to 40% of patients being defined as adherent. The variability in adherence is greatest for patients whose treatment regimen changed the most during follow-up.
The values for urine protein excretion and serum blood urea nitrogen in BPS-treated rats were significantly lower than those in untreated rats. In rats treated with 400 microg/kg BW BPS, neither sclerotic changes nor inflammatory cell infiltration were observed. Index of glomerulosclerosis and glomerular volume were also significantly reduced compared with untreated rats. Intriguingly, BPS reduced the level of serum triglyceride. In the glomerulus of treated rats, advanced glycation end product formation and macrophage influx were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner.
Based on the survey results, there appears to be a tendency toward increased acceptance of donors with a history of kidney stones. 77% of responding centers allowed stone formers to donate. Nearly 40% of centers reported that their attitude towards accepting donors with kidney stones has changed over the last 5-10 years. Among these, the overwhelming majority reported that they were more likely to accept these donors.
Significantly more patients had received steroid therapy and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS-I) in group L than in group E (steroid 51.7 vs. 15.4%, p &lt; 0.001; RAS-I 42.0 vs. 1.5%, p &lt; 0.001). Forty patients overall reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 81.9 +/- 55.1 months of observation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 10-year renal survival rate of group L persisted and significantly differed from that of group E (95.7 vs. 75.2%, p = 0.005). The Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for known prognostic markers demonstrated that initial therapeutic interventions in group L prevented ESRD, with a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95% CI 0.11-0.76, p = 0.011).
FITC-albumin extravasation continued to increase in a time-dependent fashion after MBG infusion and was significant (p &lt; 0.05) at 60 min of observation when compared to sham rats. We also observed a significant difference in 'vascular leakage' in preeclamptic rats compared to control non-pregnant and normal pregnant groups starting at 20 min after the FITC-albumin infusion.
PAN induced massive proteinuria, serum creatinine elevation and podocyte apoptosis in PAN nephropathy rats, which was associated with the loss of nephrin, an adhesion molecule specific for the glomerular slit and the reduced of p-Akt/Akt ratio. Moreover, PAN induced foot process retraction, redistribution of nephrin and the activation of TGF-beta/Smad-signaling pathway. Compared with PAN nephropathy rats, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) significantly prevented loss of nephrin, foot process retraction and podocyte apoptosis by stimulating Akt phosphorylation and suppressing TGF-beta/Smad-signaling pathway.
Hypertension was likelier among participants with than without CKD regardless of CVD history, but awareness, treatment, and control were not. Hypertensive participants with CKD were less likely than those without to be taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blocking agents. Of participants with no CVD history, high cholesterol was likelier among those with CKD stages 3-4 than among those without CDK, but awareness and treatment were less likely; of participants with CVD history, high cholesterol was less likely among those with than without CKD, and awareness and treatment were as likely. Diabetes control was less likely among diabetic participants with early-stage CKD than without CKD, but not significantly different between late-stage and non-CKD participants.
A cohort of 199 patients was studied. At entry, these values were examined and the prognostic significances were investigated. In estimating the significance of baPWV, patients with ABI &lt;0.9 were excluded. During the follow-up period, 24 deaths occurred including 14 cardiovascular and 10 noncardiovascular fatal events. Overall, the survival rates were significantly lower in the low ABI than in the high ABI group, but the survival rates were not significantly different between the high and low FMD, NMD, or baPWV groups. Cardiovascular survival rates were significantly lower in the low ABI than in the high ABI group, and in the high baPWV than in the low baPWV group. The survival rates were not significantly different between the high and low FMD or NMD groups.
The age-adjusted prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dl) at an estimated GFR of 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was 17% increasing to 56% for those participants with an estimated GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), while the age-adjusted prevalence of elevated C-reactive protein (CRP &gt;0.21 mg/dl) and reduced 25(OH)D (&lt;20 ng/ml) was 50 and 30%, respectively. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities and laboratory results, 25(OH)D &lt;20 ng/ml (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03-1.32; p = 0.014) and log CRP (OR: 3.63; 95% CI: 2.4-5.48 per unit increase of log CRP; p &lt; 0.0001) were associated with hemoglobin levels &lt;12 g/dl.
CsA treatment for 14 days led to increased transforming growth factor-beta transcript levels and collagen III deposition in the postischemic kidney. However, neither the total number of alpha-smooth-muscle-actin-positive interstitial myofibroblasts, nor the bone marrow-derived fraction thereof was affected by CsA administration, irrespective of dosage and duration of treatment.
Compared to the control-treatment animals on day 28, real-time PCR, Western blot, and confocal microscopy revealed that Smad7 gene transfer significantly attenuated the increased peritoneal fibrosis including the thickening of fibrotic peritoneum, accumulation of alpha-SMA and collagen I, and an improvement in peritoneal dysfunction (all p &lt; 0.05). Importantly, Smad7 treatment also improved the severity of peritoneal fibrosis and functional impairment when compared to those on day 14 before treatment (all p &lt; 0.05). Inhibition of the established peritoneal fibrosis by Smad7 was associated with an abrogation of TGF-beta signaling and upregulation of TGF-beta1 and PAI-1.
Participants who received the experimental treatment demonstrated no greater motivation to quit, use of treatment services, or abstinence compared to controls at either follow-up assessment. In fact, controls reported greater motivation to quit at 12 months (M 3.42 vs 3.20, p=0.03), greater use of pharmacotherapy at 6 months (37.8% vs 28.0%, p=0.02), and greater 30-day point prevalent abstinence at 6 months, after controlling for relevant covariates (10.8% vs 6.4%, adjusted p=0.04).
The median facility-reported 60-day follow-up rate for positive screening FOBTs was 24.5%. Several strategies were associated with timeliness of follow-up. The relationship between the implementation of QI infrastructure strategies and timely follow-up was mediated by the implementation of process-change strategies. Although constraints on gastroenterology capacity were often sited as a key barrier, implementation of strategies to address this issue was unassociated with timely follow-up.
Based on accelerometer data, approximately 48% and 10% of adolescents met the MVPA recommendation depending on the MVPA criteria. Adolescents who met phyiscial activity recommendation had higher MVPA min/day (p&lt;0.001) and higher step counts (p&lt;0.001), after adjusting for gender, age, and ethnicity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses found that 9930 steps produced 0.84 sensitivity and 0.81 specificity (area under the curve [AUC] =0.89) and 11,714 steps produced 0.75 and 0.81 specificity (AUC=0.94) for meeting the recommendation using the 3/6 and 4/7 criteria, respectively.
Half of the 254 counties in Texas had no mammography facility. After controlling for confounding factors, an in-county facility was associated with significantly higher odds of screening (OR=3.27; p=0.03) and lower odds of late-stage breast cancer at diagnosis (OR=0.36; 95% CI=0.26-0.51; p&lt;0.001). The risks of late-stage diagnosis were higher for African-American women (OR=1.52; 95% CI=1.22-1.89; p&lt;0.001) and Hispanic women (OR=1.23; 95% CI=0.99-1.53; p=0.06) than for white women.
In this community, only 26% of respondents reported having complete home smoking bans. Smoking respondents and families were less likely to have complete smoking bans in the home. Home smoking bans were positively associated with the perceived density of smoke-free homes in the community, and with the perceived likelihood of community reprimand for smoking in the home.
From January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2008, there were 547 articles that met the inclusion criteria that were published. It was possible to classify 314 (57%) articles into at least one of the four IOM PHEP research goal areas. Of these, 61 (11%) addressed Research Area 1 (usefulness of training); 39 (7%) addressed Research Area 2 (communications in preparedness and response); 193 (35%) addressed Research Area 3 (sustainable preparedness and response systems); and 39 (7%) addressed Research Area 4 (criteria and metrics to measure effectiveness and efficiency). Twenty-one studies (4%) could be classified into more than one category. The majority of the articles (81%), including commentaries/reviews and case studies, were based on qualitative analysis. Commentaries/review articles were the most common study types (62%).
Pre-reminder, 63.4% of targeted women completed a mammogram; this number increased to 75.4% in the post-reminder implementation phase; 80.6% completed a mammogram in the maintenance phases. After controlling for demographics and clinic visits, intervention women were 1.51 times more likely to complete a mammogram (CI=1.40, 1.62) post-reminder implementation, compared to CG1. The effect was maintained in 2007 (hazard ratio 1.81, CI=1.65, 1.99).
Among adults aged 18-64 years with asthma, influenza vaccination coverage was 39.9% (95% CI=38.3%, 41.5%) during the 2006-2007 season (coverage ranged from 26.9% [95% CI=19.8%, 35.3%] in California to 53.3% [95% CI=42.8%, 63.6%] in Tennessee). Influenza vaccination coverage was 33.9% (95% CI=31.9%, 35.9%) for adults aged 18-49 years with asthma compared to 54.7% (95% CI=52.4%, 57.0%) for adults aged 50-64 years with asthma. Among people aged 18-64 years, vaccination coverage was 28.8% among those without asthma. People with asthma who had an increased likelihood of vaccination were aged 50-64 years, female, non-Hispanic white, and had diabetes, activity limitations, health insurance, a regular healthcare provider, routine checkup in the previous year, and formerly smoked or never smoked.
Tobacco industry research identified characteristics of social smokers that include: (1) denial of personal nicotine addiction; (2) self-categorization as a nonsmoker; (3) propensity for decreased tobacco use in response to smoke-free laws; (4) variations in age, education, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds; and (5) a perceived immunity to personal health effects of tobacco but fear of consequences to others. Tobacco companies developed marketing strategies aimed at social smokers, including "non-habit forming" cigarettes.
The literature search identified 1227 articles, 35 of which met review criteria. Five of the 14 RCTs met &gt; or =70% of CONSORT checklist items. Five general procedures for involving parents were identified: (1) face-to-face educational programs or parent training, (2) family participatory exercise programs, (3) telephone communication, (4) organized activities, and (5) educational materials sent home. Lack of uniformity in reporting trials, multiple pilot studies, and varied measurements of physical activity outcomes prohibited systematic conclusions. Interventions with educational or training programs during family visits or via telephone communication with parents appear to offer some promise.
Geographic clusters of significantly high or low prevalence of walking and biking were detected in LAC and SDC. Structural variables such as street connectivity and shorter block lengths are consistently associated with higher levels of active transportation, but associations between active transportation and socioeconomic variables at the individual and neighborhood levels are mixed. Only one cluster with less time spent walking and biking among walkers/bikers was detected in LAC, and this was of borderline significance. Age-adjustment affects the clustering pattern of walking/biking prevalence in LAC, but not in SDC.
Here, we report the verification of the malate synthase activity of this predicted protein and its recombinant production in E. coli, purification and biochemical characterization. The malate synthase G of P. aeruginosa PAO1 has a temperature and pH optimum of 37.5 degrees C and 8.5, respectively. Although displaying normal thermal stability, the enzyme was stable up to incubation at pH 11. The following kinetic parameters of P. aeruginosa PAO1 malate synthase G were obtained: Km glyoxylate (70 microM), Km acetyl CoA (12 microM) and Vmax (16.5 micromol/minutes/mg enzyme). In addition, deletion of the corresponding gene showed that it is a prerequisite for growth on acetate as sole carbon source.
We first review algorithms for the enumeration of paths and cycles and show that these algorithms are superior to a recently proposed enumeration approach based on elementary-modes computation. The main part of this work deals with the computation of shortest positive/negative paths, an NP-complete problem for which only very few algorithms are described in the literature. We propose extensions and several new algorithm variants for computing either exact results or approximations. Benchmarks with various concrete biological networks show that exact results can sometimes be obtained in networks with several hundred nodes. A class of even larger graphs can still be treated exactly by a new algorithm combining exhaustive and simple search strategies. For graphs, where the computation of exact solutions becomes time-consuming or infeasible, we devised an approximative algorithm with polynomial complexity. Strikingly, in realistic networks (where a comparison with exact results was possible) this algorithm delivered results that are very close or equal to the exact values. This phenomenon can probably be attributed to the particular topology of cellular signaling and regulatory networks which contain a relatively low number of negative feedback loops.
This paper introduces modular models for representing network structure in order to study the relative effects of different filtering methods. We show that cluster analysis and principal components are strongly affected by filtering. Filtering methods intended specifically for cluster and network analysis are introduced and compared by simulating modular networks with known statistical properties. To study more realistic situations, we analyze simulated "real" data based on well-characterized E. coli and S. cerevisiae regulatory networks.
Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with DADLE (4 mg/kg every 2 h x 4 injections, i.p.) or saline prior to unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Daily behavioral tests revealed that ischemic animals treated with DADLE did not show any significant behavioral dysfunctions compared with saline-treated ischemic animals. Opioid antagonists only transiently inhibited the protective effect of DADLE, indicating the participation of non-opioid mechanisms in DADLE neuroprotection. Histological examination using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) revealed that brains from ischemic animals treated with DADLE, either alone or with adjuvant opioid blockers, exhibited almost completely intact striata. In contrast, brains from ischemic animals that received saline showed significant infarction in the lateral striatum. Analyses of apoptotic cell death revealed a significant increase in the p-53 mRNA expression in the striatum of ischemic animals that received saline, while those that received DADLE exhibited near normal striatal p-53 expression. This protective effect was accompanied by significant increments in protein levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum of DADLE-treated ischemic animals.
There was no statistically significant association between the TGFBR1*6A allele and CRC (p &gt; 0.05). The OR was 1.147 (95% CI: 0.799-1.647) for carriers of the TGFBR1*6A allele and 0.878 (95% CI: 0.306-2.520) for homozygous TGFBR1*6A individuals compared with the reference. The frequency of the polymorphism was not affected by age, sex or tumour stage. The TGFBR1*6A allele was more prevalent among colon tumour patients than among rectal tumour patients. Tumour somatic mutations were found in only two of 69 cases (2.9%). Both cases involved a GCG deletion that changed genotype 9A/9A in normal DNA to genotype 9A/8A. Interestingly, these two tumours were positive for microsatellite instability, suggesting that these mutations originated because of a deficient DNA mismatch repair system.Allele-specific expression of the 9A allele was detected in seven of the 14 heterozygous 9A/6A tumour cases. This could have been caused by linkage disequilibrium of the TGFBR1*6A allele with mutations that cause allele-specific expression, as was recently suggested.
P-gp activity, but not MRP1 and BCRP, attenuated AVE9633 and DM4 cytotoxicity in myeloid cell lines. Zosuquidar, a potent specific P-gp inhibitor, restored the sensitivity of cells expressing P-gp to both AVE9633 and DM4. However, the data from AML patients show that 10/25 samples of AML cells (40%) were resistant to AVE9633 or DM4 (IC(50) &gt; 500 nM), and this was not related to P-gp activity (p-Value: 0.7). Zosuquidar also failed to re-establish drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this resistance was not correlated with CD33 expression (p-Value: 0.6) in those cells.
249(Ser) mutation was found in 21/74 (28%) samples while HBV DNA was detected in 13/74 (16%). 249Ser mutation was detected in 21/74 samples by RFLP assay, of which 14 were confirmed by 249(Ser) mutant-specific PCR, and 12 by nucleic acid sequencing. All HCC cases with p53-249ser mutation displayed also wild-type p53 sequences. Poorly differentiated HCC was more likely to have 249(Ser) mutation (OR = 2.415, 95% CI = 1.001 - 5.824, p = 0.05). The mean size of 249(Ser) HCC tumor was 9.4 cm versus 5.5 cm on wild type HCC (p = 0.012). HBV DNA detection was not related to 249(Ser) mutation.
Pan-cytokeratin positive cells were increased in the circulation of patients with NSCLC, as compared to normal control subjects. Patients with pan-cytokeratin +/CXCR4+ = 2,500 cells/ml had a significant improvement in median survival when compared with patients with pan-cytokeratin +/CXCR4+ &gt;2,500 cells/ml (not achieved versus 14 weeks). CXCR4 expression was found on NSCLC tumors and at sites of tumor metastasis.
MPO positive cells were present in 79% of ruptured caps, 28% of thin cap fibroatheroma, and no fibroatheromas; neutrophils were present in 72% of ruptures, 8% of thin cap fibroatheromas, and no fibroatheromas. Iron containing foam cells were present in the caps of 93% of acute ruptures, of 85% of organizing ruptures, 20% of thin cap atheromas, and 10% of fibroatheromas. MPO positive cells were more frequent in occlusive than non-occlusive thrombi adjacent to ruptures (p = .006) and were more numerous in diabetics compared to non-diabetics (p = .002)
We found that: (i) the 28S:18S ratio and RNA quality indicator (RQI) were good predictors of severe total RNA degradation, however, the greatest changes in the quantity of different mRNAs (FMR1, DNMT1, GUS, B2M and GAPDH) occurred during the early to moderate stages of degradation; (ii) chromatographic features for the 18S, 28S and the inter-peak region were the most reliable predictors of total RNA degradation, however their use for target gene normalization was inferior to internal control genes, of which GUS was the most appropriate. Using GUS for normalization, we examined in the whole blood the relationship between the FMR1 mRNA and CGG expansion in a non-coding portion of this gene, in a sample set (n = 30) with the large variation in rRNA quality. By combining FMR1 3' and 5' mRNA analyses the confounding impact of mRNA degradation on the correlation between FMR1 expression and CGG size was minimized, and the biological significance increased from p = 0.046 for the 5' FMR1 assay, to p = 0.018 for the combined FMR1 3' and 5' mRNA analysis.
Comparative analysis of the P. patens, S. moellendorffii and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes suggests that the well-established rapid transcriptional response to auxin of flowering plants, evolved in vascular plants after their divergence from the last common ancestor shared with mosses. An N-terminally truncated ARF transcriptional activator is encoded by the genomes of P. patens and S. moellendorffii, and suggests a supplementary mechanism of nuclear auxin signalling, absent in flowering plants. Site-specific analyses of positive Darwinian selection revealed relatively high rates of synonymous substitution in the A. thaliana ARFs of classes IIa (and their closest orthologous genes in poplar) and Ib, suggesting that neofunctionalization in important functional regions has driven the evolution of auxin signalling in flowering plants. Primary auxin responsive gene families (GH3, SAUR, LBD) show different phylogenetic profiles in P. patens, S. moellendorffii and flowering plants, highlighting genes for further study.
Sequence variation in both cytochrome b (CYTB, mtDNA) and the rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP, nuclear) are examined at a fine scale within four different regions for populations of T. californicus. High levels of genetic divergence are seen for both genes at the broader scale, and genetic subdivision is apparent at nearly all scales in these populations for these two genes. Patterns of polymorphism and divergence in both CYTB and RISP suggest that selection may be leading to non-neutral evolution of these genes in several cases but a pervasive pattern of neither selection nor coadaptation is seen for these markers.
41 original papers in English were found; no RCT's. 16 out of 41 studies used some sort of graded scoring system. No studies had objectively evaluated QoL before or after stent treatment, using standardized QoL-questionnaires, 32/41 studies reported on stent patency and 9/41 performed an oral contrast examination after stent placement. Objective quantitative tests of gastric emptying had not been performed.
Overall, age adjusted incidence rates in esophageal carcinoma increased from 4.49 to 4.72 cases/100,000 persons per year in Michigan from 1985 to 2005. Among white males, the rate of adenocarcinomas increased by 0.21 cases/100,000 per year to a maximum of 6.40 cases/100,000 in 1999, after which these rates remained constant. There was a slight but non-significant increase in the rate of adenocarcinomas among African American males, for whom the average incidence rate was 8 times lower than that for white males (0.58 vs 4.72 cases/100,000 person years). While average BMI is rising in Michigan (from 26.68 in 1988 to 30.33 in 2005), average BMI was slightly higher among African Americans on average, and the rates of increase in BMI were not different between African American males and white males.
Expression profiles were obtained using a new filarial microarray with 18, 104 64-mer elements. 771 genes were identified as differentially expressed in two-way comparative analyses of the three L3 types. 353 genes were up-regulated in mosquito L3 (L3i) relative to cultured L3 (L3c). These genes are important for establishment of filarial infections in mammalian hosts. Other genes were up-regulated in L3c relative to L3i (234) or irradiated L3 (L3ir) (22). These culture-induced transcripts include key molecules required for growth and development. 165 genes were up-regulated in L3ir relative to L3c; these genes encode highly immunogenic proteins and proteins involved in radiation repair. L3ir and L3i have similar transcription profiles for genes that encode highly immunogenic proteins, antioxidants and cuticle components.
The heat map graphically illustrates the genetic complexity of drought related traits in rice. QTLs can be linked to their physical position on the rice genome using Additional file 1 provided. Formal meta-analysis on chromosome 1, where clusters of QTLs for all trait categories appear close, established that the sd1 semi-dwarfing gene coincided with a plant height meta-QTL, that the drought avoidance meta-QTL was not likely to be associated with this gene, and that this meta-QTL was not pleiotropic with close meta-QTLs for leaf morphology and root traits. On chromosome 5, evidence suggests that a drought avoidance meta-QTL was pleiotropic with leaf morphology and plant biomass meta-QTLs, but not with meta-QTLs for root traits and plant height 10 cM lower down. A region of dense root QTL activity graphically visible on chromosome 9 was dissected into three meta-QTLs within a space of 35 cM. The confidence intervals for meta-QTLs obtained ranged from 5.1 to 14.5 cM with an average of 9.4 cM, which is approximately 180 genes in rice.
Examination of the 63 Escherichia coli isolates revealed an almost equal distribution among the E. coli phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D. High prevalence (36/63) of the CTX-M-15 gene was observed and an analysis of PFGE-based patterns revealed the presence of this CTX-M allele in multiple clones. Resistance to cefotaxime was a transferable trait and a commonly occurring 145.5 kb conjugative IncFI plasmid was detected in 65% of E. coli carrying the CTX-M-15 allele. The rate of transferable antibiotic resistances for GM, SXT, TET, GM-SXT-TET, SXT-TET and GM-TET was 33%, 61%, 61%, 27%, 44% and 11%, respectively. The remaining strains did not have a common IncFI plasmid but harboured transferable IncFI plasmids with sizes that ranged from 97 to 242.5 kb.
We confirmed that the enumeration of IFN-gamma releasing cells upon Mtb-specific stimulation is sufficient to identify TB patients and that CD8+ T cells concur to IFN-gamma secretion. IL-2 secreting cells were more frequently observed in latent TB infected individuals compared to active TB patients, suggesting that measurement of cells secreting this cytokine could be a marker of disease stage. No discriminating role was associated to IL-10 and IL-17 release in TB patients.
A total of 3619 women were screened and 1644 enrolled at the Ikeja and Apapa clinics in Lagos, and at the Central and Peripheral clinics in Port Harcourt. Twelve months after study initiation, the overall incidence of HIV was less than one-third of the pre-study assumption, with rates of HIV that varied substantially between clinics. Due to the low prevalence and incidence rates of HIV, it was decided to close the Ikeja clinic in Lagos and to find new catchment areas in Port Harcourt. This strategy was associated with an almost two-fold increase in observed HIV incidence during the second year of the study.
Seventy eight H. pylori isolates, including 27 Chinese, 35 Indian and 16 Malay isolates from Malaysia were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of seven housekeeping genes and compared with the global MLST data. STRUCTURE analysis assigned the isolates to previously identified H. pylori ancestral populations, hpEastAsia, hpAsia2 and hpEurope, and revealed a new subpopulation, hspIndia, within hpAsia2. Statistical analysis allowed us to identify population segregation sites that divide the H. pylori populations and the subpopulations. The majority of Malay isolates were found to be grouped together with Indian isolates.
In this study we tested the rapid nongenomic effects of several physiological estrogens [estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3)] on dopamine efflux via the DAT in a non-transfected, NGF-differentiated, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell model that expresses membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha, beta, and GPR30. We examined kinase, ionic, and physical interaction mechanisms involved in estrogenic regulation of the DAT function. E2-mediated dopamine efflux is DAT-specific and not dependent on extracellular Ca2+-mediated exocytotic release from vesicular monoamine transporter vesicles (VMATs). Using kinase inhibitors we also showed that E2-mediated dopamine efflux is dependent on protein kinase C and MEK activation, but not on PI3K or protein kinase A. In plasma membrane there are ligand-independent associations of ERalpha and ERbeta (but not GPR30) with DAT. Conditions which cause efflux (a 9 min 10(-9) M E2 treatment) cause trafficking of ERalpha (stimulatory) to the plasma membrane and trafficking of ERbeta (inhibitory) away from the plasma membrane. In contrast, E1 and E3 can inhibit efflux with a nonmonotonic dose pattern, and cause DAT to leave the plasma membrane.
In this study we have generated and analyzed BAC transgenic mice carrying 168 kb of the human BDNF locus modified such that BDNF coding sequence was replaced with the sequence of a fusion protein consisting of N-terminal BDNF and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The human BDNF-BAC construct containing all BDNF 5' exons preceded by different promoters recapitulated the expression of endogenous BDNF mRNA in the brain and several non-neural tissues of transgenic mice. All different 5' exon-specific BDNF-EGFP alternative transcripts were expressed from the transgenic human BDNF-BAC construct, resembling the expression of endogenous BDNF. Furthermore, BDNF-EGFP mRNA was induced upon treatment with kainic acid in a promotor-specific manner, similarly to that of the endogenous mouse BDNF mRNA.
In the present study, we developed an A. rhizogenes-mediated transformation of Superroot-derived L. corniculatus for gene function investigation, combining the efficient A. rhizogenes-mediated transformation and the rapid regeneration system of Superroot. The transformation system using A. rhizogenes K599 harbouring pGFPGUSPlus was improved by validating some parameters which may influence the transformation frequency. Using stem sections with one node as explants, a 2-day pre-culture of explants, infection with K599 at OD(600) = 0.6, and co-cultivation on medium (pH 5.4) at 22 degrees C for 2 days enhanced the transformation frequency significantly. As proof of concept, Superroot-derived L. corniculatus was transformed with a gene from wheat encoding an Na+/H+ antiporter (TaNHX2) using the described system. Transgenic Superroot plants were obtained and had increased salt tolerance, as expected from the expression of TaNHX2.
Knockout mutants of atlig1 are lethal. Therefore, RNAi lines with reduced levels of AtLIG1 were generated to allow the roles and importance of Arabidopsis DNA ligase 1 in DNA metabolism to be elucidated. Viable plants were fertile but displayed a severely stunted and stressed growth phenotype. Cell size was reduced in the silenced lines, whilst flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase of cells in S-phase in atlig1-RNAi lines relative to wild type plants. Comet assay analysis of isolated nuclei showed atlig1-RNAi lines displayed slower repair of single strand breaks (SSBs) and also double strand breaks (DSBs), implicating AtLIG1 in repair of both these lesions.
Of the 13 loci analyzed in 84 T. miscellus individuals, 11 showed loss of at least one parental homoeolog in the young allopolyploids. Two loci were retained in duplicate for all polyploid individuals included in this study. Nearly half (48%) of the individuals examined lost a homoeolog of at least one locus, with several individuals showing loss at more than one locus. Patterns of loss were stochastic among individuals from the independently formed populations, except that the T. dubius copy was lost twice as often as T. pratensis.
According to the results of the meta-analysis of the three double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials, atosiban and betamimetics have similar efficacy (RR = 0.99, 95%CI:0.94-1.04, p = 0.772). Compared to betamimetics, use of atosiban was associated with a significantly lower frequency of adverse events for tachycardia, palpitation, vomiting, headache, hyperglycaemia, tremor, dyspnoea, chest pain, hypocalemia and foetal tachycardia. In our economic analysis, cost savings from using atosiban versus continuous, or bolus, fenoterol was 423euro per patient from the payer's perspective. From the hospital's perspective, savings from using atosiban versus continuous fenoterol ranged from 259euro for 18 hours of tocolysis to 105euro for 48 hours; the respective values for bolus fenoterol were 244euro and 55euro. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis atosiban was cost saving versus both continuous and bolus fenoterol in 87%-100% of scenarios.
After median follow-up of 6 years, 237 new cases of diabetes were ascertained corresponding to an age and sex standardized cumulative incidence of 6.4% (95%CI: 5.6-7.2) and incidence rate of 10.6 (9.2-12.1) per 1000 person years. Besides classical diabetes risk factors, female sex and low education level significantly increased risk of diabetes in age adjusted models. In full model, the independent predictors were age [OR, 95%CI: 1.2 (1.1-1.3)], family history of diabetes [1.8 (1.3-2.5)], body mass index &gt;or= 30 kg/m2 [2.3 (1.5-3.6)], abdominal obesity [1.9 (1.4-2.6)], high triglyceride [1.4 (1.1-1.9)], Isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [7.4 (3.6-15.0)], Isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [5.9 (4.2-8.4)] and combined IFG and IGT [42.2 (23.8-74.9)].
Mean 25(OH)D was 13.7 ng/mL, and 61% of men were classified as having vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D &lt;15 ng/mL). Even among men with vitamin D intake &gt;or= 400 IU/day, 55% had 25(OH)D concentrations &lt;15 ng/mL. In multivariate models, 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with supplemental vitamin D intake (OR 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5, 12.4) for &gt;400 vs. 0 IU/day), milk consumption (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.2, 16.0 for &gt;or= 3.5 vs. &lt;1 time per week), and blood collection in the summer. Additionally, 25(OH)D concentrations increased with more recreational physical activity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6 per hour). A significant inverse association of body mass index with 25(OH)D concentrations in bivariate analyses was attenuated with adjustment for season of blood collection.
The median RFEI for adults in Edmonton was 4.00 within an 800 m buffer around their residence and 6.46 within a 1600 m buffer around their residence. Approximately 14% of the respondents were classified as being obese. The odds of a resident being obese were significantly lower (OR = 0.75, 95%CI 0.59 - 0.95) if they lived in an area with the lowest RFEI (below 3.0) in comparison to the highest RFEI (5.0 and above). These associations existed regardless of the covariates included in the model. No significant associations were observed between RFEI within a 1600 m buffer of the home and obesity.
The economic immigrant population resident in Spain, present diseases that are similar to those of the indigenous population. The immigrant population shows significantly lower values in the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and physical activity (OR = 0.76; CI 95%: 0.65-0.89, they nonetheless perceive their health condition as worse than that reported by the autochthonous population (OR = 1.63, CI 95%: 1.34-1.97). The probability of the immigrant population using emergency services in the last 12 months was significantly greater than that of the autochthonous population (OR = 1.31, CI 95%: 1.12-1.54). This situation repeats itself when analyzing hospitalization data, with values of probability of being hospitalized greater among immigrants (OR = 1.39, CI 95%: 1.07-1.81).
CT scores correlated best with DLNO (rS = -0.83; p &lt; 0.001). Scores were also related to the volume-specific NO transfer coefficient (KNO; rS = -0.63; p &lt; 0.01) and to DLCO (rS = -0.79; p &lt; 0.001) but not KCO. Z-scores for DLNO were significantly lower than for DLCO (p &lt; 0.001). Correlations with spirometric (e.g., FEV1, IVC) or bodyplethysmographic (e.g., SRaw, RV/TLC) indices were weaker than for DLNO or DLCO but most of them were also significant (p &lt; 0.05 each).
Specific issues affecting the analysis and interpretation of simulation data are investigated, including: (1) the effect of time interval on data presentation and time-weighted averaging of molecule numbers, (2) effect of time averaging interval on reaction rate analysis, (3) effect of number of simulations on precision of model predictions, and (4) implications of stochastic simulations on optimization procedures.
24 studies were included. The odds of developing allergic sensitisation was 1.91 (95% confidence interval 1.44 to 2.54) in the family studies and 1.57 (1.20 to 2.07) in the case-control studies. The odds of developing atopic eczema was 1.99 (1.72 to 2.31) in the family studies and 4.78 (3.31 to 6.92) in the case-control studies. Three studies investigated the association between filaggrin gene mutations and allergic rhinitis in people without atopic eczema: overall odds ratio 1.78 (1.16 to 2.73). The four studies that investigated the association between filaggrin gene mutations and allergic rhinitis in people with atopic eczema reported a significant association: pooled odds ratio from case-control studies 2.84 (2.08 to 3.88). An overall odds ratio for the association between filaggrin gene mutations and asthma in people with atopic eczema was 2.79 (1.77 to 4.41) in case-control studies and 2.30 (1.66 to 3.18) in family studies. None of the studies that investigated filaggrin gene mutations and asthma in people without atopic eczema reported a significant association; overall odds ratio was 1.30 (0.7 to 2.30) in the case-control studies. The funnel plots suggested that publication bias was unlikely to be an explanation for these findings. No studies investigated the association between filaggrin gene mutations and food allergy or anaphylaxis.
Incidence data covering at least seven years before screening and seven years after screening had been fully implemented, and including both screened and non-screened age groups, were available from the United Kingdom; Manitoba, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; Sweden; and parts of Norway. The implementation phase with its prevalence peak was excluded and adjustment made for changing background incidence and compensatory drops in incidence among older, previously screened women. Overdiagnosis was estimated at 52% (95% confidence interval 46% to 58%). Data from three countries showed a drop in incidence as the women exceeded the age limit for screening, but the reduction was small and the estimate of overdiagnosis was compensated for in this review.
During the one year follow-up, 145 athletes reported a recurrent ankle sprain: 56 (22%) in the intervention group and 89 (33%) in the control group. Nine athletes needed to be treated to prevent one recurrence (number needed to treat). The intervention programme was associated with a 35% reduction in risk of recurrence. Cox regression analysis showed significantly fewer recurrent ankle sprains in the intervention than in the control group. This effect was found for self reported recurrent ankle sprains (relative risk 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.88), recurrent ankle sprains leading to loss of sports time (0.53, 0.32 to 0.88), and recurrent ankle sprains resulting in healthcare costs or lost productivity costs (0.25, 0.12 to 0.50). No significant differences were found between medically treated athletes in the intervention group and medically treated controls. Athletes in the intervention group who were not medically treated had a significantly lower risk of recurrence than controls who were not medically treated.
FAs were on average 9% for pseudo-targets and 0.2% for other types of lures, indicating that the former were more difficult to suppress. Target-related ERP components (occipito/temporal selection negativity, posterior P3b and precentral motor N2) were greater to pseudo-targets than other distracters. A large prefrontal negativity (370-430 ms) was also identified, much larger to pseudo-targets than non-targets (and absent in response to real targets), thus reflecting response inhibition and top-down cognitive control processes.
The response rate was 81.5%. Male and female orthodontists were seen to have different working patterns. The difference was statistically significant with male orthodontists undertaking clinical work on average 1.5 sessions more per week than their female colleagues. The calendar year of completion of undergraduate studies and the number of children an orthodontist has can significantly affect the number of clinical sessions they work each week. In recent years it has been observed that there is greater ethnic diversity among the workforce but ethnic origin appeared to have a minimal effect on the number of clinical sessions worked each week. The amount and length of career breaks taken by female orthodontists was greater than their male colleagues. In addition, there continues to be an uneven distribution of orthodontists throughout the United Kingdom.
While levels of dental anxiety did not reduce overall, the most anxious patients demonstrated a reduction in anxiety after receiving midazolam premedication (p = 0.01). Neither induction behaviour nor psychological morbidity improved. Irrespective of group, parents reported less hyperactive (p = 0.002) and more pro-social behaviour (p = 0.002) after the procedure; older children improved most (p = 0.048). Post-GA dental attendance was poor and unaffected by premedication.
The median follow-up was 5.8 years. Overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years and 10 years were 63% and 55%, respectively. Corresponding disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 67% and 61%, respectively. Stratified analysis by resection margin status demonstrated that CMT compared with surgery alone improved OS (80% vs 31%; P = .02) and DSS (80% vs 35%; P = .02) for patients with positive/uncertain resection margins. Multivariate analysis indicated that CMT for patients with positive/uncertain resection margins improved OS (P &lt; .0001). A total of 44 (37%) patients experienced local disease recurrence (LR) and 25 (21%) developed distant metastases (DM). There was no difference noted with regard to DSS if disease recurrence was isolated (LR vs DM: 26% vs 29%, respectively, at 5 years; P = .48) The use of CMT versus surgery alone improved local control (LC) (75% vs 24%; P = .006) for patients with positive/uncertain resection margins. The rate of surgical complications was 28% at 5 years. The rates of RT-associated complications were 40% and 47% at 5 years and 10 years, respectively.
Patients with secondary CBF AML were found to have significantly worse overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) compared with patients with de novo CBF AML. Secondary CBF AML status appeared to have only marginal significance in multivariate analysis.
There were 143 admissions for fever among 48 children. Among 35 admissions with emesis, 19 included bacteremia; whereas, among 107 admissions without emesis, 19 included bacteremia (P &lt; .001). There was a 5-fold greater risk of bacteremia in children with children without vomiting (odds ratio, 5.50; 95% confidence interval, 2.20-13.67). Gram-negative organisms were more likely to be associated with vomiting than Gram-positive organisms (P = .008). Children with severe neutropenia did not have a significantly higher rate of bacteremia than children who had neutrophil counts &gt;500 cells/mm(3). Other factors that were associated with higher rates of bacteremia were underlying diagnosis and catheter type.
AA women were significantly older at diagnosis (61 years vs 56 years, P = .001), and the size of the tumor was larger in AA patients (P = .001). The other pathological features examined were not statistically different between the 2 groups. Treatments with surgery and radiation were also similar. However, the CA patients were more likely to receive hormone therapy. Recurrence rate as DCIS or invasive carcinoma was similar in both patient groups, as was death due to disease. Time to recurrence with invasive carcinoma, however, was shorter for AA patients (32.8 +/- 13 vs 58 +/- 9; P = .02). Only overall survival (OS) rate was higher for CA patients (92% vs 71% at 10 years; P = .003).
: Seven hundred sixty-one survivors identified from 2 North Carolina cancer registries participated. The average survivor was 10.4 years postdiagnosis (range, 2-44 years postdiagnosis) and was age 62.7 years (range, 25-92 years). Survivors with active disease (n = 109) demonstrated worse physical and mental health functioning, worse QOL, and less positive and more negative impacts of cancer compared with disease-free survivors (n = 652; all P &lt; or = .01). No significant differences were observed between STS and LTS.
Among 74 patients, 3 achieved a pathologic complete response, and 29 (41%) of 71 residual tumors demonstrated high-grade budding in the invasive front. The 5-year survival rate of patients with low-grade budding tumors was 49%, compared with 17% for those with high-grade budding (P &lt; .001). Budding correlated inversely with good response, which was observed in 44 (60%) of 74 patients. Univariate analysis showed that pathologic tumor depth, number of lymph node metastases, pathologic stage, lymphatic invasion, budding and clinical response were significant prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis identified budding as the most important prognostic factor followed by number of lymph node metastases.
The resulting 78-item Support Person Unmet Needs Survey has high acceptability, item test-retest reliability, internal consistency (Chronbach alpha = .990), and face, content, and construct validity. It captures 6 domains of unmet needs and accounts for 73.5% of total variance: Information and Relationship Needs (27 items, 22.1% of variance), Emotional Needs (16 items, 15.2%), Personal Needs (14 items, 14.0%), Work and Finance (8 items, 8.8%), Health Care Access and Continuity (9 items, 8.6%), and Worries About Future (4 items, 4.8%).
NV-128 was able to induce significant cell death in both paclitaxel-resistant and carboplatin-resistant EOC cells with a GI(50) between 1 microg/mL and 5 microg/mL. Cell death was characterized by chromatin condensation but was caspase-independent. The activated pathway involved the down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and phosphorylated ribosomal p70 S6 kinase, and the mitochondrial translocation of beclin-1 followed by nuclear translocation of endonuclease G.
Of 691 patients, 88 patients had myxoid liposarcoma and 603 had other STS subtypes (other-STS). Median age was 48 and 60 years for the myxoid liposarcoma and other-STS groups, respectively. Median follow-up was 86 and 61 months, respectively. For myxoid liposarcoma and other-STS groups, preoperative RT was used in 57% versus 61% of patients and postoperative RT in 43% versus 39%, respectively. The 5-year local recurrence-free survival was 97.7% for patients with myxoid liposarcoma compared with 89.6% for patients with other-STS tumors (P = .008). High-grade tumors were present in 7% and 59% of myxoid liposarcoma and other-STS patients, respectively (P = .0003). Two myxoid liposarcoma patients with local recurrence had positive resection margins, whereas only 33% of patients in the other-STS group who developed a local recurrence had positive resection margins. No patients with myxoid liposarcoma required amputation as primary management, whereas 8 (1.3%) required amputation as primary management in the other-STS group. Systemic disease control was superior in myxoid liposarcoma compared with other-STS patients, with 5-year overall and metastasis-free survival rates of 93.9% versus 76.4% (P = .0008) and 89.1% versus 66.0% (P = .0001) respectively. Of 12 myxoid liposarcoma patients with distant metastases, 7 appeared in nonpulmonary sites. In comparison, 205 (34%) patients with other-STS tumors developed systemic disease but 78% had pulmonary metastases.
Childhood physical abuse was associated with 49% higher odds (95% CI, 1.10-2.01) of cancer when adjusting for age, sex, and race only. The odds ratio decreased only slightly to 47% higher odds (95% CI, 1.05-1.99) when the model was adjusted for all 3 clusters of risk factors.
Women were more likely to have earlier stage disease, to have smoked &lt;50 pack-years, and to have adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma (all P &lt; or = .001). For each stage, treatment did not differ between women and men. Five-year survival rates were significantly better for women than for men: overall survival (OS), 28.6% versus 16.1% (P &lt; .001); disease-free survival, 31.2% versus 20.1% (P = .02); and distant metastasis-free survival, 48.8% versus 37.6% (P &lt; .02). Among patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC, women had improved 5-year OS compared with men (30.0% vs 13.1%; P = .004). On multivariate analysis, male sex, weight loss, age &gt; or =65 years, and stage III disease were found to be associated with poorer OS (all P &lt; 0.02).
The median peak SUV was 4.5 (range, 1.4-21.9). The survival curve was analyzed using the median peak SUV as the cutoff value. Comparison of each group and clinicopathologic characteristics revealed significant associations between peak SUV and each of the following factors: tumor status (P &lt; .001), lymph node status (P &lt; .001), metastatic status (P &lt; .05), stage of disease (P &lt; .001), number of PET-positive lymph nodes (P &lt; .001), and the number of histologically positive lymph nodes (P &lt; .001). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients having FDG uptake with a peak SUV &gt; or =4.5 was 47% and that for patients with a peak SUV &lt;4.5 was 76% (P &lt; .0001). On multivariate survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model, peak SUV and the number of PET-positive lymph nodes were found to be independent predictive factors for OS. The number of PET-positive lymph nodes was a single prognostic factor predicting both disease-free survival and OS.
In total, 1105 patients with breast cancer were evaluated for NASH, and 24 cases of NASH were documented (2.2%). Seven patients had NASH before their diagnosis of breast cancer, and 17 patients developed NASH after their diagnosis of breast cancer. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with NASH were tamoxifen use (odds ratio [OR], 8.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-63.72), body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20), and age (OR, 95% CI, 0.91-0.99). NASH improved after tamoxifen was stopped. After discontinuation of tamoxifen, transaminase levels returned to normal in 14 of 16 patients.
Participants had a range of prior experience with interpretation in the context of cancer and clinical trials. Training increased mean accuracy from 49% to 72% in knowledge items about cancer, and from 72% to 78% in knowledge about clinical trials. Interpreters reported several areas of concern with respect to standards of practice.
uPAR was expressed by all CRC cell lines studied. In vitro, ATN-658 had minimal effect on CRC proliferation in monolayers, but significantly decreased CRC cell migration. In vivo, ATN-658 lead to significant reductions in tumor growth versus control when initiated either 4 or 12 days after tumor implantation (-65% vs control [P &lt; or = .05] and -85% vs control [P &lt; or = .05]). ATN-658 significantly inhibited in vivo tumor cell proliferation in both studies.
The response rate after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was 34% (complete response, 13.8%; partial response, 20.7%). Myelosuppression was the dominant toxicity; 2 patients had toxic deaths related to thrombocytopenia with trauma. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 49% +/- 7%, and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 31% +/- 7%, with a median follow-up of 11.4 years (range, 5.2-15.0 years). For medulloblastoma, the 5-year PFS was 26% +/- 9%; for EP it was 33% +/- 10%; for CPCA it was 80% +/- 18%; and for primitive neuroectodermal and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors it was 0%. Localized EP patients with gross total resection who did not undergo radiotherapy had a 5-year PFS of 57% +/- 17% and OS of 71% +/- 16%. Two patients developed late second malignancies; 1 was associated with germline p53 mutation.
The results demonstrated a significant correlation between the methylation of the GSTP1 or MDR1 promoters and negative expression of their respective proteins in BAC (P &lt; .05). A significant correlation also was demonstrated between GSTP1 methylation and recurrence-free and overall survival of patients with BAC. DNMT1 protein expression levels were correlated with GSTP1 promoter methylation and patient prognosis (P &lt; .05). However, no correlation was observed between DNMT1 expression and MDR1 methylation.
The 16-item THC questionnaire was consistent internally (Cronbach alpha = .90) and valid based on its expected positive association with emotional acceptance of terminal illness (r = .31; P &lt; .0001). THC scores were related inversely to symptom burden (r = -.19; P = .006), functional status (Karnofsky performance status; r = .22; P = .001), and mental illness (THC score: 50.69 for patients with any Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM] diagnosis vs 55.22 for patients with no DSM diagnosis; P = .03). THC scores were not associated significantly with EOL discussions (P = .68). Among the patients who died, EOL intensive care unit (ICU) care was associated inversely with therapeutic alliance (THC score: 46.5 for patients who received ICU care vs 55.5 for patients without ICU care; P = .002), so that patients with higher THC scores were less likely to spend time in the ICU during the last week of life.
Follow-up interview participants were younger, more predominantly white, and of higher socioeconomic status than women who did not respond. Among 764 participants who completed the follow-up interview, 663 (86.8%) reported receiving adjuvant treatment for their BC. Of those 663 women, 401 (60.5%) reported using antioxidants during adjuvant treatment: One hundred twenty of 310 women (38.7%) used antioxidants during chemotherapy, 196 of 464 women (42.2%) used them during radiation, and 286 of 462 women (61.9%) used them during tamoxifen therapy. Of 401 antioxidant users, 278 women (69.3%) used high doses (doses higher than those contained in a Centrum multivitamin). The factors that were associated with high antioxidant supplement use during treatment were higher fruit and vegetable intake at diagnosis (relative risk [RR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.59), tamoxifen use (RR, 3.66; 95% CI, 2.32-5.78), ever using herbal products (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.26-5.38), and ever engaging in mind-body practices (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.13-2.64).
A total of 1534 cancer research articles were identified, of which 661 (representing 1,096,098 participants) were prospective clinical studies and were analyzed further. For all 7 non-sex-specific cancer types assessed, the majority of studies analyzed included a lower proportion of women than the proportion of women among patients having cancer of that type in the general population. Among studies focusing on cancer treatment, women constituted a significantly lower overall proportion of the participants in the analyzed studies than expected for 6 of 7 non-sex-specific cancer types (P &lt; .001). Among non-sex-specific studies, the mean percentage of participants who were women was 38.8%. Non-sex-specific studies reporting government funding had a higher percentage of female participants (mean 41.3% vs 36.9%; P = .005). In a regression model controlling for cancer type, lack of government funding (P = .03) and focus on cancer treatment (P = .03) were found to be independent significant predictors of a lower percentage of female participants.
Childhood testicular cancer incidence varied 3- to 4-fold, whereas adult testicular cancer incidence varied 10- to 11-fold between the studied populations. No positive correlation between childhood and adulthood incidence of testicular cancer was found.
During 1978 to 2005, more than 54,000 stomach carcinoma cases were diagnosed among residents of the nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results areas. Total stomach carcinoma rates declined by 34% from the 1978-1983 to the 2001-2005 time periods. By histologic type, intestinal rates decreased consistently, whereas those for diffuse rates increased through 2000 and declined in recent years. By anatomic site, cardia rates increased during earlier years and then decreased, whereas rates for all other sites declined. When considered jointly by histologic type and anatomic site, intestinal carcinoma rates decreased for all sites except the cardia; diffuse rates increased through 2000 and decreased in recent years for all sites except the overlapping/nonspecified sites. Both diffuse and intestinal rates were lowest among whites, intermediate among blacks, and highest among the other, primarily Asian, races, with only modest gender differences for the diffuse type. In contrast, cardia carcinoma rates were highest among whites and were notably higher among males, especially whites among whom the male/female rate ratio was five to one.
One thousand six hundred and ninety-eight eligible breast cancer cases were selected and 1,223 participated, for a response rate of 72.0%, which varied little by race/ethnicity. Age, race/ethnicity, and clinical factors were not associated with response; however, respondents were slightly more likely to be married and from higher socioeconomic status census tracts than nonrespondents. The RCA definition of Hispanic identity was highly sensitive (94.6%) and specific (90.0%). Lower acculturation was associated with lower education and literacy among Latinas.
The analysis was carried out comparing 382 "genetic" and 1,333 "sporadic" cases. We found a borderline significant interaction between genetic breast cancer and oral contraceptive use for ever users compared with never users (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7). The greatest interaction OR was found for women who started using pill at 18 to 20 years (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3).
Smoking was associated with an increased colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.95) for &gt; or =30 pack-years compared with never smokers (P trend = 0.0004). The association was stronger with presence of the "rapid" compared with the "slow/intermediate" NAT2 genotype (P interaction = 0.003). No significant associations were observed for intakes of red meat, processed meat, and heterocyclic amine, or meat doneness preference, but a dietary pattern high in meat showed a weak positive interaction with the NAT2 genotype (P interaction = 0.05).
After 50,899 person-years of follow-up, 111 individuals had developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The highest risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, compared with seronegative individuals without diabetes, was in anti-HCV(+) individuals with diabetes [incidence rate ratio (IRR), 76.0], then coinfected (IRR, 46.0), anti-HCV(+) without diabetes (IRR, 26.1), HBsAg(+) with diabetes (IRR, 21.4), and seronegative with diabetes (IRR, 7.2; P &lt; 0.001). Anti-HCV(+) (n = 132) and seronegative individuals (n = 352) with diabetes had a higher cumulative incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma than those without diabetes (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that gender, age, body mass index &gt; or =30, HBsAg(+) [hazards ratio (HR), 12.6], anti-HCV(+) (HR, 18.8), coinfection (HR, 25.9), and diabetes [HR, 2.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-4.3] were independent predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma (P &lt; 0.05). After stratifying hepatitis status in multivariate Cox analysis, diabetes was significant for seronegative (HR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.7-17.1) and anti-HCV(+) individuals (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.4). Body mass index &gt; or =30 was significant for HBsAg(+) individuals (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.1).
During 8.9 years of follow-up, we documented 88 incident cases of EAC and 110 cases of ESCC. BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were positively associated with EAC risk [highest versus lowest quintile; relative risk (RR), 2.60; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.23-5.51; P(trend) &lt; 0.01; RR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.35-6.98; P(trend) &lt; 0.003; and RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 0.98-4.57; P(trend) &lt; 0.004]. In contrast, BMI and waist circumference were inversely related to ESCC risk, whereas WHR showed no association with ESCC. In stratified analyses, BMI and waist circumference were significantly inversely related to ESCC only among smokers but not among nonsmokers. However, when controlled for BMI, we found positive associations for waist circumference and WHR with ESCC, and these associations were observed among smokers and nonsmokers.
Usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia was present adjacent to vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in 25 of 130 cases. Usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia-associated squamous cell carcinomas had high p16(INK4A) expression, and 24 of 25 squamous cell carcinomas contained integrated high-risk HPV DNA. Differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia was found adjacent to 105 of 130 vulvar squamous cell carcinomas. High-risk HPV was detected in 11 (10.5%) differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia-associated vulvar squamous cell carcinoma but correlated with high p16(INK4A) expression in only one case. Integration of viral DNA was never observed in differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia-associated squamous cell carcinomas, which suggests that a causal relationship of high-risk HPV in differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia-associated tumors is highly unlikely. The disease-specific survival of the differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia-associated vulvar squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly worse compared with patients with a usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia-associated tumor.
Concentrations of PlGF, sFlt-1, and s-endoglin did not differ between women who later developed breast cancer and control women, and odds ratios across quartiles of each factor did not indicate any association in blood samples from gestational week 10, 23, or 35. During pregnancy, there was a general increase in each angiogenic factor, but degree of increase from one sampling period to the next was not associated with later breast cancer risk. Among cases, 22 of 145 died from breast cancer during 10 years of follow-up, but there was no consistent indication that angiogenic factors measured in pregnancy up to several years before diagnosis were associated with case fatality.
Seventy-eight of 837 (9%) women entered for screening were ineligible using the strict entry criteria. Thirty-nine cancers were detected in 1,869 women-years in study (incidence 21 per 1,000). Including 3,561 further years follow-up, 28 more breast cancers were identified (12 of 1,000). Incidence rates for 759 eligible women were 22 of 1,000 in study and 13 of 1,000 in total follow-up, compared with 9 of 1,000 and 4 of 1,000, respectively, in 78 ineligible women. Breast cancer rates were higher for BRCA2 than BRCA1 after testing anonymized samples in this selected population at 65 of 1,000 in study and 36 of 1,000 in total follow-up for BRCA2 compared with 44 of 1,000 and 27 of 1,000 for BRCA1.
The current level of screening reduces CRC mortality by 44.1% when compared with no screening. Increasing diagnostic follow-up compliance to 95% can lead to an additional 9.3% reduction in CRC mortality, whereas increasing initial screening compliance to 95% can result in an additional 50.4% reduction. These increases can be achieved at a cost of about $7,500 ($1,309-$32,864) per life year saved and $14,000 ($3,620-$35,855) per life year saved for diagnostic follow-up and initial screening tests, respectively.
Of the 936 women included in the analysis, 620 were examined by film and 316 by digital mammography. There were small and statistically nonsignificant variations in breast dense, nondense area, and percent density over the menstrual cycle in women examined by film mammography. Marginally significant variation in percent density was observed in the digital subset due to significant differences in the amount of nondense tissue over the menstrual cycle.
The most common oncogenic HPV types were HPV 16 (38%), 18 (19%), 45 (22%), and 52 (19%). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 52, 59, and 68 were associated with high-grade histology. The number of HPV genotypes per anal swab was higher for anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 2/3 than for normal or AIN 1 histology [median, 5 types (interquartile range) (IQR), 3-7 versus 3.5 (IQR), 2-6; P = 0.0005]. HPV 16 viral load was also associated with AIN 2/3 histology. There was no difference in p16 or E6 transcripts between histologic grades. In the multivariable logistic regression model, HPV genotypes 16 [odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.31-5.08; P = 0.006] and 31 (odds ratio, 4.74; 95% CI, 2.00-11.22; P = 0.0004), baseline CD4 count &lt; 400 cells/mm(3) (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.46-5.99; P = 0.0025), and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness (odds ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.22-4.82; P = 0.01) were associated with high-grade histology after adjusting for age.
Total colonocyte yield in the F fraction (mean, 433.8 per 100 microL) was higher than in the S (140.3) and P (204.6) fractions (P = 0.004 and 0.03, respectively) due to increased numbers of morphologically abnormal cells, which predominantly represented malignant cells in samples from CRC patients. Several thousand abnormal cells could be obtained from stool-derived mucus in all CRC patients, an order of magnitude greater than numbers in subjects without CRC. Median MCM2 labeling index in abnormal cells was 50% (range, 30-60%) in CRC patients and 0% in subjects without CRC. Cells in clot sections were well preserved and not obscured by fecal debris.
During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, 212 women died. Of the reproductive factors examined, only age at menarche and number of lifetime ovulatory cycles (LOC) relative to age significantly predicted ovarian cancer survival. Risk for death was higher among women with highest number of LOC compared with those having fewest LOC (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.20-2.33). Women with fewest LOC had the highest 15-year survival (56.7%; 95% CI, 47.8-64.6%), and women with the highest LOC had the poorest (33.3%; 95% CI, 25.3-41.5%). Women whose age at menarche was &lt;12 years had a higher risk of death compared with women whose menses began at &gt; or =14 years (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.24).
The systolic blood pressure was increased whereas the heart beat and cardiac output (n=6) were decreased by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone caused increase in the heart weight to body weight ratio (P&lt;0.001, n=20), increased level of mRNA of atrial natriuretic peptide and an increased deposition of collagens in the extracellular matrix of the left ventricle which were inhibited by both mifepristone and losartan. The rate of oxygen consumption was decreased in association with increased levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha, lipid peroxidation (P&lt;0.01, n=3) and superoxide dismutase activity (P&lt;0.01, n=3) in dexamethasone treated rat heart. All these changes were reversed by mifepristone and losartan.
Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine) significantly attenuated myocardial injury, as shown by reduced release of CK and LDH, preserved SOD activity and decreased MDA production and MPO activity. Concomitant with cardioprotection by calcium channel blockers, the mRNA and protein expression of Egr-1 increased with I/R and H/R injury was significantly reduced in myocardial tissue and cultured cardiomyocytes.
DNA methylation of K(v)1.3 gene promoter was observed in 42.3% of samples (22/52). The methylated status was associated with poorly differentiated tumors (p=0.04) and younger patients (p=0.048). Decreased K(v)1.3 expression was observed in grade III tumors, at both the mRNA and protein levels, while methylation increased in grade III tumors. Finally, K(v)1.3 gene promoter was methylated in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line while promoter methylation was absent in primary culture of normal breast cells (HMEpC).
Small pores of mean size 50 nm that were assigned to water channels, and extended orifices of mean size 300 nm that exhibit a neck-like extracellular segment were observed at the iRBC membrane.
Xenopus oocytes expressing AT1 or AT2 generated oscillatory chloride currents by coupling to the diacylglycerol/inositol-3-phosphate (DAG/IP(3)) cascade. Ang II activation of collagenase-defolliculated oocytes expressing rat AT1A yielded larger chloride currents (9.2+/-3.4 A) than those generated by oocytes expressing bovine AT1 (3.78+/-2.6 A). Oocytes expressing rat AT1A were recovered from desensitization after 0.5 h and completely after 10.5 h; whereas oocytes expressing bovine AT1 receptors were unable to do so. Expression of rat AT2 generated smaller chloride currents (32-210 nA). Expression of AT2 receptors triggered GVBD whereas AT1 did not. The proportion of oocytes developing GVBD was greater for folliculated oocytes than for oocytes that were defolliculated. Furthermore, oocytes injected with AT2 secreted into the media, a heat-resistant factor(s) that stimulated GVBD of oocytes. This media elicited inward and outward membrane currents when applied to non-injected oocytes.
Beating cardiomyocytes were generated using a mass culture system from murine N10 and O9 iPS cells as well as R1 and D3 ES cells. Transcripts of the mesoderm specification factor T-brachyury and non-atrial cardiac specific genes were expressed in differentiating iPS EBs. Using immunocytochemistry to determine the expression and intracellular organisation of cardiac specific structural proteins we demonstrate strong similarity between iPS-CMs and ES-CMs. In line with a previous study electrophysiological analyses showed that hormonal response to beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor stimulation was intact. Action potential (AP) recordings suggested that most iPS-CMs measured up to day 23 of differentiation are of ventricular-like type. Application of lidocaine, Cs+, SEA0400 and verapamil+ nifedipine to plated iPS-EBs during multi-electrode array (MEA) measurements of extracellular field potentials and intracellular sharp electrode recordings of APs revealed the presence of I(Na), I(f), I(NCX), and I(CaL), respectively, and suggested their involvement in cardiac pacemaking, with I(CaL) being of major importance. Furthermore, iPS-CMs developed and conferred force to avitalized ventricular tissue that was responsive to beta-adrenergic stimulation.
Exposure of ROB cells to AOPPs-RSA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, down-regulated the expression of osteocalcin mRNA and protein in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner. AOPPs challenge induced ROS generation and NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation, which were inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase and NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin. Furthermore, NF-kappaB inhibitor SN50 could reverse the AOPPs-induced inhibition of ROB cell proliferation and differentiation.
ADMA significantly impaired basal or insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy- [3H] glucose uptake, and decreased the expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4). Phosphorylated protein of IRS-1 and translocation of GLUT4 with insulin-stimulation were also inhibited by ADMA. NO decreased, while production of ROS and TNF-alpha, and expression of TLR4 increased after ADMA treatment. Vitamin E reduced the effects of ADMA on glucose transport system, and on NO, ROS and TLR4. Moreover, vitamin E decreased ADMA contents by up-regulating dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity in adipocytes. Though L-arginine also increased NO level, but failed to reduce the effects of ADMA.
80% of the respondents reported that they had tried drinking alcohol, and 57% had been intoxicated at least once. The proportion of the students, which had tried alcohol, was equal in both genders and increased with age. Attention problems and conduct problems were strongly associated with frequent alcohol intoxications in both genders. Anxiety and depressive symptoms among girls were also related to high numbers of intoxications
Tracheostomy surgery lasted on average 3.3+/-1.9 min. It caused no bleeding requiring treatment nor injuries to the posterior tracheal wall. One fracture of a single tracheal cartilage ring was revealed, and one patient developed subcutaneous emphysema during the balloon dilatation. No wound infection was observed.
In the examination period 403 patients underwent appendectomy and 11.2% (n=45) were older than 60 years. These patients were characterized by significantly more frequent perforations compared to those patients &lt; or =60 years (35.6% versus 7.0%, p&lt; or =0.05), peritonitis (42.2% versus 9.5%, p&lt; or =0.05), conversion to open surgery (23% versus 5%, p&lt; or =0.005), longer postoperative hospital stay (9.2 days versus 4.3 days, p&lt; or =0.05) and a higher complication rate (28.9% versus 3.6%, p&lt; or =0.005). CRP values in patients &gt;60 years were on average 123.2 mg/l and significantly higher than in patients &lt; or =60 years (35.5 mg/l, p&lt; or =0.005). The ROC analysis resulted in a CRP cut-off value of 101.9 mg/l for patients &gt;60 years for the existence of a perforation with a specificity of 72.4% and a sensitivity of 81.3% (AUC 0.811).
Fifteen women (16.7%) had persistent pain 4 months after hysterectomy. In 11 women, the pain resembled their preoperative pain, whereas 4 women had pain likely to be related to surgery. Preoperative "pain problems elsewhere" and a high "acute postoperative pain intensity" were associated with having pain 4 months after hysterectomy (P = 0.004 and P = 0.034). A similar tendency was seen for preoperative "pelvic pain" (P = 0.059). Women with pain at 4 months reported lower quality of life in 4 Short Form-36 subscales and less control of pain preoperatively (P &lt; 0.05 and P = 0.023).
Thirty-two of 34 patients attended at 1-week assessment, 24 (75%) felt that they were improved, and 8 (25%) considered they were unchanged or worse. In both the saline and lignocaine groups, 12 of 16 patients felt that they had improved. N-saline proved as effective as lignocaine in reducing knee pain when injected intradermally. Seventy-five percent of patients were improved at 1 week.
A total of 656 patients with CRPS of at least 1-year duration were evaluated. The average age of all participants was 37.5 years, with disease duration varying from 1 to 46 years. The majority of participants were white (96%). A total of 80.3% were females. None of the patients in this study demonstrated spontaneous remission of their symptoms. The pain in these patients was refractory showing only modest improvement with most current therapies.
TENS seemed to be equivalent in efficacy to nortriptyline. A significant decrease in visual analog scale scores of pain and/or sensory complaints of the upper extremities occurred in both groups. Of the 29 people treated with TENS, the mean (SD) intensity of pain and/or sensory complaints decreased from 5.3 (1.6) at baseline to 2.8 (1.5) at 8 weeks follow-up (P &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly in the 30 people treated with nortriptyline, the mean (SD) intensity of pain and/or sensory complaints decreased from 4.9 (1.9) to 3.3 (2.1) (P &lt; 0.001). The mean difference in visual analog scale score at 8 weeks follow-up was not significant between the 2 groups (mean difference -0.5; 95% confidence interval, -1.5-0.5).
The results suggest that G-ER, especially when administered twice-daily, have the greatest effects on sharp, dull, sensitive, and itchy pain. Few between-condition effects were found for the global ratings of intensity or unpleasantness, and for hot, cold, deep, or surface pain qualities.
More than 60% in each group reported chronic pain, with the majority reporting pain in the back, hip, or knee. In all groups, patients with chronic pain were more likely to report fair or poor health than those without pain (P&lt;0.05). In the HF and diabetes groups, a higher percentage of patients with pain were not working because of health reasons. Of those with pain, more than 70% in each group took medications for pain; more than one-half managed pain with rest or sedentary activities; and less than 50% used exercise for managing their pain.
Using diary measures, daily pain intensity was related to children's levels of activity restriction. Diary completion was predicted by age and diary-type, with younger children and children using electronic diaries demonstrating higher compliance. Pain intensity was significantly higher on retrospective compared with diary measures, demonstrating inflation in retrospective reports of pain. No significant differences between measures of activity restriction emerged.
Pain scores in the current sample were significantly lower (indicating more pain) than the general population and HIV-positive persons who screened negative for psychologic and substance use problems. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of mood disorder, older age, and lower CD4 cell counts (below 200) were associated with increased pain. Presence of mood disorder accounted for the largest amount of unique variance in pain scores.
Among a total of 87.9 million Japanese people aged 30 years or older in 2005, 21.4 million (24.3%), 3.2 million (3.7%), and 9.1 million (10.4%) were estimated to have low back, hip, and knee pains, respectively. The prevalence rates of low back, hip, and knee pains will gradually increase in subsequent years, reaching 26.5%, 4.4%, and 12.9%, respectively by 2055. Consequently, the losses of QALYs associated with low back, hip, and knee pains per 1000 population will increase from 17.2, 3.8, and 8.9, respectively in 2005 to 18.8, 4.5, and 11.2, respectively by 2055.
Forty-nine patients completed the study (22 active, 27 sham). Statistically significant improvements were found for acustimulation when compared with sham at immediate posttreatment and 1-month posttreatment for Numerical Rating Scale, Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. In active and sham electrical stimulation group 38.9% and 8.3% of patients reported a reduction of Numerical Rating Scale &gt; 50% at 1-month posttreatment follow-up, respectively. All patients tolerated acustimulation and no adverse effects were reported.
A total of 77 patients who fulfilled the criteria for mild-to-moderate CTS were recruited in the study. There were 38 in the acupuncture group and 39 in the steroid group. The evaluation of GSS showed that there was a high percentage of improvement in both groups at weeks 2 and 4 (P &lt; 0.01), though statistical significance was not demonstrated between the 2 groups (P = 0.15). Of the 5 main symptoms scores (pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness/clumsiness, nocturnal awakening), only 1, nocturnal awakening, showed a significant decrease in acupuncture compared with the steroid group at week 4 (P = 0.03). Patients with acupuncture treatment had a significant decrease in distal motor latency compared with the steroid group at week 4 (P = 0.012). Acupuncture was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects.
One hundred twenty-nine adults (64.3% women, mean age 43.6 +/- 12.7 y) were treated by 48 physicians. The patients mainly had chronic low back pain (average duration 9.6 +/- 9.0 y) and other chronic diseases. Nearly all the patients (91.3%) had been pretreated. The initial case-taking took 113 +/- 36, and the case analysis took 31 +/- 38 minutes. The 7.4 +/- 8.1 subsequent consultations (duration: 23.7 +/- 15.2 min) cumulated to 204.5 +/- 184.6 minutes. The patients received an average of 6.8 +/- 6.3 homeopathic prescriptions. The severity of the diagnoses and complaints showed marked and sustained improvements with large effect sizes (Cohen's d from 1.67 to 2.55) and QoL improved accordingly (SF-36 physical component scale d = 0.33; mental component scale d = 0.54). The use of conventional treatment and health services decreased markedly: the number of patients using low back pain-related drugs was half of the baseline.
Four cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria and all met 4 or more of our 6 method quality criteria. These studies examined the diagnostic accuracy of brief screening tools for depression (sensitivity = 50.5% to 82.1%, specificity = 71.0% to 90.6%, and overall accuracy = 74.6% to 80.6%) and anxiety (sensitivity 63.0% to 94.0%, specificity = 53.0% to 71.2%, and overall accuracy = 60.0% to 68.1%). No studies were identified that examined the diagnostic accuracy of brief screening questions for fear-avoidance beliefs, social isolation, catastrophization, and somatization.
The Chi-square test indicated a statistically significant association between the presence of fatty plaques (p=0.005) and CT-detectable lesions in the brain (p=0.004). Moreover, the number of patients with CT-detectable brain lesions was greater in patients with &gt;70% stenosis than in those with &lt;70% stenosis (p=0.007). Logistic regression confirmed the association between fatty plaque and symptoms (p=0.001), between &gt;70% stenosis and symptoms (p=0.041), and an inverse association between calcified plaque and symptoms (p=0.009).
On CT and angiography, each tumour appeared as a solitary mass or as multiple nodules or masses with heterogeneously early and progressive enhancement. One of the two patients with tumour response to TACE died 8 months after initial presentation, and the remaining patient was still alive at the last follow-up 12 months after initial presentation. However, two patients with no response to TACE and two patients who underwent emergent TAE for tumour rupture died 1 week to 5 months (mean 2.1 months) after initial presentation.
The mean right posterior CPS depth was 29.2+/-15.6 mm. The average level of the posterior CPS in relation to the spine was 13.5+/-0.6, i.e., the level of lower half of the L1 vertebral body. The posterior CPS depth had a tendency to be deeper in those participants who were taller (r=0.17, p&lt;0.01), had a higher body mass index (BMI; r=0.25, p&lt;0.01), longer total diaphragmatic height (r=0.55, p&lt;0.01), and shorter diaphragmatic dome height (r=-0.18, p&lt;0.01).
Most cystic meningiomas comprised two or more cysts. The solid parts of the tumours showed moderate or marked enhancement after the injection of contrast material. An enhanced cyst wall was found in six out of 14 cases in the peritumoural cyst group, but not in the intratumoural cyst group. Peritumoural cystic meningiomas were predominately located in the cerebral falx, whereas the intratumoural cystic meningiomas were predominantly found in frontal convexity (X(2)=7.434, p=0.024). The cysts were larger in the peritumoural cyst group than in the intratumoural cyst group (t=5.274, p=0.0258). Peritumoural oedema was more commonly found in the intratumoural cyst group (X(2)=6.863, p=0.008). Cystic meningiomas with solid parts located inside the cyst are reported for the first time.
One patient developed a post-procedure haematoma, which did not require treatment. There were no other short-term complications. None of the papillomas were associated with atypia or malignancy. Subsequent breast imaging (mostly routine screening mammography) was reviewed and evidence of recurrence recorded. To date, 16 patients have received at least one subsequent routine screening mammogram, with a mean follow-up to latest mammogram of 30 months. Mammographic evidence of papilloma regrowth has been observed in two patents, with a third patient presenting with recurrence of the original symptom of a palpable lump. All three recurrent lesions were surgically excised and confirmed to be benign papillomas. These lesions measured 6, 12, and 15 mm prior to the original vacuum-assisted excision.
Three radiographers performed a total of 962 BSMs in the 4-year audit period, including a varied and complex case-mix. Only 13 (0.01%) cases were abandoned due to technical reasons, with all other examinations of diagnostic quality. Although radiation dose levels were initially variable, following the installation of modern fluoroscopy equipment they remained comfortably within the national and regional diagnostic reference levels. Consultant radiologists verified the majority of the radiographer reports, with the most experienced radiographer independently reporting 230 cases (24%). Follow-up of patient outcome was possible in 935 cases. The overall radiographer accuracy based on the 935 cases was 98.9%, sensitivity 98%, and specificity 98.9%.
There was no difference between the FFR values of diabetic and nondiabetic patients who had coronary lesions with similar degree of luminal narrowing (0.87+/-0.08 vs. 0. 0.85+/-0.07; 0.81+/-0.08 vs. 0.82+/-0.10; 0.81+/-0.10 vs. 0.83+/-0.09, P = 0.957). In the analysis comparing FFR measurements in the categories set according to reference vessel diameter, we did not find a difference either (0.82+/-0.09 vs. 0.83+/-0.09; 0.84+/-0.09 vs. 0.82+/-0.09, P = 0.878). The DeltaFFR value, which is the difference between FFR values before and after adenosine administration, was also similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (8.4+/-6.0 vs. 8.4+/-5.5, P = 0.997).
After 6 weeks, treatment with ranolazine significantly increased the EDV RH-PAT index as compared with baseline (1.85+/-0.42 vs. 2.08+/-0.57, P = 0.037). EDV RH-PAT did not change while on placebo (1.69+/-0.35 vs. 1.78+/-0.41, P = 0.29). In addition, there was a significant drop in asymmetric dimethylarginine levels with ranolazine treatment (0.66+/-0.12 vs. 0.60+/-0.11 micromol/l, P = 0.02) and a near significant decrease in C-reactive protein levels (0.40+/-0.80 vs. 0.30+/-0.61 mg/dl, P = 0.05).
Patients with LV ejection fraction &lt;45% (n=22) were compared with those with normal function (n=46). The two groups had similar age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, medical therapy, LV dimension, and number of diseased vessels. Patients with LV dysfunction, by study design, were more symptomatic and had a lower LV ejection fraction. The two groups had similar white cell count and mononuclear cells. The absolute number of CD34 and CD133 cells was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in patients with LV dysfunction as compared with patients with normal function or healthy participants. In contrast, CD14 cells were significantly (P=0.005) lower in the former patients than in the latter, whereas no significant difference was noted in the number of cells positive for CD105 among groups.
Two MPO promoter polymorphisms, -129G/A and -463G/A, were genotyped in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program population (n = 2774). The -129A allele was associated with a lower risk of MI in women [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval): 0.65 (0.43-0.98), P = 0.03] but not in men [OR: 1.12 (0.86-1.47), P = 0.38]. When women were stratified by age and hormone replacement therapy, the protective effect of the -129A allele was only evident in women younger than 55 years or not receiving hormone replacement therapy. In these two groups, OR (95% confidence interval) for carriers of the -129A allele were 0.34 (0.12-0.92) (P = 0.03) and 0.51 (0.32-0.81) (P = 0.004), respectively. For the -463G/A polymorphism, no associations to MI risk were observed either in women or in men.
There were no significant differences in the baseline and procedural characteristics of the two groups; most patients (approximately 90%) had complex coronary lesions (the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association type B2/C). There was no significant difference in the rates of periprocedural MI (11.9 vs. 8.0%, P = NS) or 30-day major adverse cardiac events (8.5 vs. 6.0%, P = NS) among patients treated with UFH+GPI or bivalirudin. However, patients who received bivalirudin had significantly lower rates of minor bleeding (20.3 vs. 4.0%, P&lt;0.05), and a trend toward significantly less major bleeding (8.5 vs. 4.0%, P = 0.07). When we compared the group treated with a prolonged bivalirudin infusion with a historical group treated with peri-PCI-only bivalirudin infusion, we observed in the latter an increased incidence of periprocedural MI and a comparable incidence of bleeding.
The composite endpoint was more frequent among the patients of the 1st quartile (M-score values &lt;-5.8). In univariate analysis, mortality of the first-quartile patients was significantly higher (14 vs. 1.1%, P&lt;0.001). In multivariate Cox's regression analysis for age, sex, diabetes, smoking status, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, maximum ST depression at TET, angina during TET, coronary artery disease on angiography, and echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction, the first quartile of M-score values was found to be independently associated with the composite endpoint (relative risk = 3.26, 95% confidence interval = 2.01-5.29, P&lt;0.001).
ST elevation MI was encountered in 32% of the patients. Other ECG findings included ST segment depression, T-wave inversion, left ventricular hypertrophy, conduction blocks and/or old MI in more than 80% of cases. Of the total of 66 patients who underwent angiography, 82% had obstructive CAD, with single-vessel disease being the most frequent finding. None of these presenting ECG findings correlated with angiographic location or severity of obstructive CAD. In nearly one-fifth of the patients, troponin elevation suggestive of cardiac myonecrosis occurred in the absence of ECG findings or angiographic coronary disease.
We analyzed culprit lesion (CL) and nonculprit lesion (NCL) of ACS patients compared with target lesion (TL) and nontarget lesion (NTL) of SA patients by intravascular ultrasound radio frequency analysis in 874 lesion segments of 424 patients (ACS: 193 patients/SA: 231 patients). Comparing all lesion segments in ACS and SA patients did not show significant differences in absolute or relative plaque composition. However, necrotic core area was larger in CL versus TL (0.9+/-0.7 vs. 0.7+/-0.5 mm, P=0.005) and all plaque components were significantly higher in CL compared with NCL and TL compared with NTL, respectively. A higher amount of thin cap fibroatheroma lesions (15.2 vs. 5.1%, P&lt;0.0001) was detected in ACS compared with SA patients. Fibrocalcific lesions were lower in ACS patients (3 vs. 10.5%, P&lt;0.0001).
For cough evaluation, bradykinin was the most potent trigger (p &lt; 0.01). In terms of dyspnea measured by Borg scale, there were no differences among stimuli (p &gt; 0.05). By visual analogue scale, bradykinin induced more dyspnea than other stimuli (p &lt; or = 0.04).
Overall traffic density was weakly associated with asthma symptoms but there was a stronger association with cough or phlegm (high traffic density OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.49). Car and truck traffic were independently associated with cough or phlegm. The results of the external validation did not support the existence of a reporting bias for the observed associations, for all the self-reported traffic indicators examined. The internal validations showed that the observed association between traffic density in the zone of residence and respiratory symptoms did not appear to be explained by an over reporting of traffic by parents of symptomatic subjects.
The body of evidence demonstrates ongoing environmental releases of MEHHs and human exposures sometimes at toxicologically relevant levels. Several sources of MEHHs in environmental media have been identified, including natural resource mining and processing and automobile exhaust. Biomonitoring studies provided direct evidence of human exposure to metals such as mercury and lead and pesticides such as p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and organophosphates. Land and water resource pollution and industrial air toxics are areas of significant data gaps, notwithstanding the presence of several emitting sources.
Primary exposure locations were at home, at school, and at other locations such as industrial property not adequately remediated or medical facilities. Exposure to small spills from broken thermometers was the most common scenario; however, reports of such exposures are declining.
Ovarian cysts were significantly increased in the 1-mug/kg BPA group; ovarian cyst-adenomas were seen in the other three BPA-treated groups but not in corn-oil controls. We observed increased progressive proliferative lesions of the oviduct after BPA treatment, similar to those described in response to DES. Further, although not statistically different from the controls, prominent mesonephric (Wolffian) remnants and squamous metaplasia of the uterus, as well as vaginal adenosis, were present in BPA-treated mice, similar to lesions reported following DES treatment. More severe pathologies observed in some BPA-treated animals included atypical hyperplasia and stromal polyps of the uterus; sarcoma of the uterine cervix; and mammary adenocarcinoma. We did not observe these lesions in controls.
The AOD model has a higher predicting power judged by adjusted R(2) (0.79) than does the non-AOD model (0.48). The predicted PM(2.5) concentrations by the AOD model are, on average, 0.8-0.9 microg/m(3) higher than the non-AOD model predictions, with a more smooth spatial distribution, higher concentrations in rural areas, and the highest concentrations in areas other than major urban centers. Although AOD is a highly significant predictor of PM(2.5), meteorologic parameters are major contributors to the better performance of the AOD model.
Concentrations of PM were not only higher during the wildfire episodes, but the PM was much more toxic to the lung on an equal weight basis than was PM collected from normal ambient air in the region. Toxicity was manifested as increased neutrophils and protein in lung lavage and by histologic indicators of increased cell influx and edema in the lung.
We found a 0.98% increase [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.22] in total mortality, a 0.85% increase (95% CI, 0.46-1.24) in CVD, a 1.18% increase (95% CI, 0.48-1.89) in MI, a 1.78% increase (95% CI, 0.96-2.62) in stroke, and a 1.68% increase (95% CI, 1.04-2.33) in respiratory deaths for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in 2-day averaged PM(2.5). The effects were higher in spring. For PM coarse, we found significant but smaller increases for all causes analyzed.
We found only limited spatial associations of AOD from three satellite retrievals with daily and yearly PM(2.5). The statistical modeling shows that monthly average AOD poorly reflects spatial patterns in PM(2.5) because of systematic, spatially correlated discrepancies between AOD and PM(2.5). Furthermore, when we included AOD as a predictor of monthly PM(2.5) in a statistical prediction model, AOD provided little additional information in a model that already accounts for land use, emission sources, meteorology, and regional variability.
The combination of DMBA treatment with lactational exposure to BPA demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in mammary tumor multiplicity and reduced tumor latency compared with controls. In the absence of DMBA treatment, lactational BPA exposure resulted in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis at 50 but not 21 days postpartum (shortly after last BPA treatment). Using Western blot analysis, we determined that steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) 1-3, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, progesterone receptor A (PR-A), and erbB3 proteins were significantly up-regulated at 50 days of age.
Neonatal parathion exposure evoked widespread abnormalities in ACh synaptic markers, encompassing effects in brain regions possessing ACh projections and ACh cell bodies. In general, males were affected more than females. Of 17 regional ACh marker abnormalities (10 male, 7 female), 15 were reversed by the high-fat diet.
Considerable levels of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid were found in all young men (medians of 24.5, 4.9, and 6.6 ng/mL, respectively). Men with high combined levels of PFOS and PFOA had a median of 6.2 million normal spermatozoa in their ejaculate in contrast to 15.5 million among men with low PFOS-PFOA (p = 0.030). In addition, we found nonsignificant trends with regard to lower sperm concentration, lower total sperm counts, and altered pituitary-gonadal hormones among men with high PFOS-PFOA levels.
The estrogenic compounds 17beta-estradiol, genistein, bisphenol A, and endosulfan produced similar protein profile changes in MCF-7 cells (phenotype: ERalpha(+)/ERbeta(+)), but had no effect on MDA-MB-231 (ERalpha(-)/ERbeta(+)), MCF-10F (ERalpha(-)/ERbeta(+)), or MCF-10A (ERalpha(-)/ERbeta(-)) cells. The most responsive proteins in MCF-7 cells were identified as histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histone levels were not increased in cell lines that showed no proliferative response to estrogens despite their rapid intrinsic growth rate in culture.
Nine hundred forty-five participants were included in our analysis. One interaction with rs9568232 in PHD finger protein 11 (PHF11) was associated with greater DeltaDBP. Interactions with rs1144393 in matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP1) and rs16930692, rs7955200, and rs10771283 in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, type 2 (ITPR2) were associated with significantly greater DeltaSBP. Because SNPs associated with DeltaSBP in our analysis are in genes along the renin-angiotensin pathway, we then examined medications affecting that pathway and observed significant interactions for angiotensin receptor blockers but not angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with PM(2.5).
All the MRS measures were lower in the lead-exposed group. Increased blood and bone lead levels correlated with declines in Cho:tCr ratios, especially in the occipital lobe, where changes in all gray, subcortical, and white matter were significant. Increases in blood and patella lead in every layer of the frontal lobe correlated with significant decreases in NAA:tCr ratios. One of the strongest regression coefficients was -0.023 (SE = 0.005, p &lt; 0.001), which was found in the NAA:tCr ratio of frontal gray matter.
Using values of Akaike's information criterion obtained under the two models, we found strong statistical evidence favoring two metabolic pathways, with respective affinities (benzene air concentrations analogous to K(m) values) of 301 ppm for the low-affinity pathway (probably dominated by cytochrome P450 enzyme 2E1) and 0.594 ppm for the high-affinity pathway (unknown). The exposure-specific metabolite level predicted by our two-pathway model at nonsaturating concentrations was 184 muM/ppm of benzene, a value close to an independent estimate of 194 muM/ppm for a typical nonsmoking Chinese female. Our results indicate that a nonsmoking woman would metabolize about three times more benzene from the ambient environment under the two-pathway model (184 muM/ppm) than under the one-pathway model (68.6 muM/ppm). In fact, 73% of the ambient benzene dose would be metabolized via the unidentified high-affinity pathway.
Between January 2003 and June 2008, we received 1,769 urine specimens for U analysis. The mean urine U measure was 0.009 microg U/g creatinine. Mean urine U concentrations for Gulf War and post-Gulf War veterans were 0.008 and 0.009 microg U/g creatinine, respectively. Only 3 of the 1,700 (0.01%) specimens for which we completed isotopic determination showed evidence of DU. Exposure histories confirmed that these three individuals had been involved in "friendly fire" incidents involving DU munitions or armored vehicles.
In multiple-pollutant models that adjust for the levels of other pollutants, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in EC was associated with a 0.80% [95% posterior interval (PI), 0.34-1.27%] increase in risk of same-day cardiovascular admissions, and an IQR increase in OCM was associated with a 1.01% (95% PI, 0.04-1.98%) increase in risk of respiratory admissions on the same day. Other components were not associated with cardiovascular or respiratory hospital admissions in multiple-pollutant models.
PD risk was increased separately in DAT A clade diplotype carriers [AA vs. BB: OR = 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.57] and 3' VNTR 9/9 carriers (9/9 vs. 10/10: OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.96-3.57), and our data suggest a gene dosing effect. Importantly, high exposure to paraquat and maneb in carriers of one susceptibility allele increased PD risk 3-fold (OR = 2.99; 95% CI, 0.88-10.2), and in carriers of two or more alleles more than 4-fold (OR = 4.53; 95% CI, 1.70-12.1). We obtained similar results for occupational pesticide measures.
No combination of parameters for a simple model in which risk of progression remains constant over time can meet the empirical constraints of relatively frequent early cases and continuing development of new cases with long latencies. Modeling shows that the risk of progression is initially high and then declines over time. Also, it is likely that there are at least two populations that differ significantly in risk. The cost-effectiveness of repetitive screening declines over time, although new cases will still be found with long latencies. However, screening will be particularly cost-effective when applied to persons with long latencies who have not been previously screened.
In cross-sectional analyses, the prevalence of dyspnea, wheeze, rhinosinusitis, and GERD remained relatively stable, whereas cough and sore throat declined, especially between 1 and 2 years post-9/11. We found a dose-response relationship between arrival time and symptoms in all years (p &lt; 0.01). Logistic models of symptoms at year 4 in the cohort demonstrated independent effects of earlier arrival and longer work duration: each additional month of work increased the odds of symptoms 8-11%.
We identified a set of 99 genes that responded to low levels of arsenic. Nineteen of these genes were predicted to function in a common regulatory network that was significantly associated with immune response and cancer (p &lt; 10(-41)). Arsenic-mediated expression changes were validated by QPCR.
Proximal airways demonstrated little mineral dust accumulation, but membranous and respiratory bronchioles had wall thickening, remodeling, and inflammation associated with carbonaceous and mineral dust deposition. These changes were independently associated with agricultural work, cigarette smoking, and increased age. Mineral dust small airways disease, pneumoconiosis (macules and nodules), and pathologic changes consistent with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and interstitial fibrosis predominated in farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers. CSi, determined gravimetrically, and aluminum silicate particles, determined by SEM/XRS, were increased in the lungs of farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers and were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) associated with small airway disease and pneumoconiosis.
In general, air pollutants were associated with platelet aggregation [average, +8% per interquartile range (IQR), p &lt; 0.01] and thrombin generation (average, +1% per IQR, p &lt; 0.05). Platelet aggregation was not affected by in vitro incubation of plasma with PM. We observed no relationship between any of the air pollutants and fibrinogen or CRP levels.
A significant risk of astrocytoma was associated with exposures to herbicides from residential use (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0). Combining parental exposures to herbicides from both residential and occupational sources, the elevated risk remained significant (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). We observed little association with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) for any of the pesticide classes or exposure sources considered.
Detection of any PCB congener in the dust conferred a 2-fold increased risk of ALL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-3.17]. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of total PCBs, the highest quartile was associated with about a 3-fold risk (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.41-5.48), and the positive trend was significant (p = 0.017). Significant positive trends in ALL risk were apparent with increasing concentrations of PCB congeners 118, 138, and 153. We observed no significant positive associations for chlordane, DDT, DDE, methoxychlor, or pentachlorophenol. The associations with PCBs were stronger among non-Hispanic whites than among Hispanics despite similar distributions of PCB levels among controls in each racial/ethnic group.
In pregnant women, we found a positive association between HO-PCBs and T(3) concentrations (beta = 0.57, p = 0.02). In umbilical cord blood, PCB-153 concentrations were negatively associated with TBG levels (beta = -0.26, p = 0.01). In a subsample analysis, a negative relationship was also found between maternal PCP levels and cord fT(4) concentrations in neonates (beta = -0.59, p = 0.02). No association was observed between contaminants and thyroid hormones at 7 months of age.
Three key themes emerged from the data that were labelled as: trauma in the context of wider shared oppression; resisting and responding; and cultural protection and growth. Many participants described their lives prior to arriving in the UK as involving a collective traumatisation as a result of being a victim of oppression related to their cultural identity. The participants described the importance of staying connected to their culture. Giving and providing social support, religious practices, and the role of interpreter facilitated remaining connected.
Of the 520 recruited age-sex matched sample (260 Gypsies and Travellers matched with 260 Pakistani Muslims, African Caribbean, and White residents), 516 were included in this analysis (173 men, 343 women). There were no differences by age between the four groups but men were approximately four years older than women. There were significant statistical differences in smoking status and educational attendance with more Gypsies and Travellers being current smokers (58% (95% confidence interval (CI) 52, 64) versus 25% (14, 38) or lower in the other groups) and having poorer regular educational attendance (61% (54, 68) versus 89% (77, 96) or higher in the other groups). For all health outcomes examined, Gypsies and Travellers had significantly poorer outcomes (after adjustment for age, sex and smoking status) compared with the White population. The health status of the Pakistani Muslims and African Caribbeans was similar to that of the Gypsies and Travellers for health in the past year, asthma, and depression, but other outcomes (cough, sputum) were significantly less prevalent. There were also significant differences in specific outcomes between African Caribbean and Pakistani Muslim populations. Consultations with various health professionals and use of health services varied between the groups.
Respondents in the two groups were equally distributed by demographic characteristics. Bedouin respondents reported less CAM use during the previous year (26.3% vs. 50.2%, P&lt;0.0001), and less use of traditional medicine and herbs. Compared to non-Bedouins, Bedouin respondents who were considering CAM use expressed more drug reluctance. Respondents in both groups greatly supported a theoretical scenario of CAM integration in primary-medical care, and expected their family practitioner to initiate the referral to CAM. Bedouin respondents held higher expectations for their physician to refer them to CAM and to offer CAM treatment in the clinic. Moreover, Bedouins expected to receive CAM in a primary-care setting, and supported the option that their family physician would provide CAM in such a setting more than the non-Bedouin Muslims did.
In a multivariate analysis, being non-White emerged as the primary predictor variable (beyond patient age, gender, marital status, education, cancer site, duration of illness, and presence or absence of metastases) of several of the PSQ-III satisfaction subscales. Conclusion. Health care systems must consider how to become more responsive to the needs of all individuals, regardless of their ethnic background and levels of acculturation.
Visible minority women were more than twice as likely never to have had a Pap test. Among visible minority women, those who recently immigrated to Canada and did not have a regular physician had the highest risk for not having a Pap test. Common reasons reported for not having a Pap test included believing it was not necessary and simply not getting around to it.
We interviewed 34 Sub-Saharan African refugee parents (intervention) and 12 non-African refugee parents (non-intervention) attending a paediatric refugee clinic, between June 2005 and May 2006, with a total number of 112 children. The mean ages of the children were 12 and 10 years for the Africans and non-Africans, respectively. Our targeted health promotion campaign appeared to be effective in increasing attendance for target communities compared to the non-targeted communities (OR for African families attending clinic 3.0, 95% CI=1.5-6.2, p&lt;0.001). We observed a significant change in parental knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about infectious diseases after attending the clinic, including decreased stigma around tuberculosis, more awareness of the seriousness of some infections, and increased awareness of the role of immunisation in prevention of infectious diseases.
Among 495 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 9 (1.9%, 8 men, age range of 61-84 years) were identified with IT. Patients with IT could be categorized into three groups: a filling defect (4) during digital subtraction angiography (DSA), a stenosis-mimic lesion on DSA (3), and a mobile mass on carotid duplex (2). All patients had follow-up vascular imaging studies. Complete or partial resolution of IT was seen in 8 patients. Four patients developed transient or minor ischemic symptoms, which were potentially related to IT. Stenosis-mimic lesions and IT adjacent to atherosclerotic plaques appeared to be associated with unstable clinical courses.
Brainstem hemorrhage was the most common cause of hyperthermia (64%), followed by putamino-thalamus hemorrhage (24%), cerebellum hemorrhage (4%), large cortical infarct (4%), basilar artery occlusion (3%), and intraventricular hemorrhage (1%). Whatever the site of the lesion, all patients had brainstem involvement either by direct destruction or indirect compression. Three fourths of the patients reached 39 degrees C within 12 h of stroke, and 82% arrived at the maximum within 24 h. A peculiar finding of central hyperthermia was the marked fluctuation in body temperature within a short period, which was more severe initially then decreased gradually. Leukocytosis was seen in 60%, but shift to the left was rare (1%). The prognosis was grave, nearly 70% of the patients expired within 1 month, especially those with a temperature of &gt;41 degrees C or those who reached 39 degrees C within 6 h after onset of stroke, or those who had severe fluctuations in temperature.
In a linear regression model, AP percentage area was associated with age (p &lt; 0.0001) and APOE epsilon4 allele (p &lt; 0.0001), but not with CW score (p = 0.70) or gender (p = 0.11). Similarly, the NFT count was predicted only by age (p &gt; 0.0001), and not by CW score (p = 0.36), gender (p = 0.41) or APOE epsilon4 allele (p = 0.072).
There was no significant difference in the hs-CRP value between the PD and the ischemic cerebrovascular disease groups, but the subjects in the 2 disease groups demonstrated higher hs-CRP levels than those in the normal control group. A post-hoc analysis of the 4 PD subgroups showed no significant differences in hs-CRP values. In addition, this study demonstrated that the odds ratio of the PD group by hs-CRP was 2.037 (95% CI 1.180-3.517; p = 0.011).
Eight cases were identified from 77 new cases presenting with IIH. All 8 had documented microcytic anaemia with clinical evidence of raised intracranial pressure. There was no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis on MRI and MR venography in 7 subjects and on repeated CT venography in 1. On correction of anaemia alone, 7 cases resolved. One patient with severe progressive visual loss underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt in addition to treatment of anaemia, with good outcome. The incidence of this association is 10.3%.
174 ischemic stroke patients with a mean age of 70.3 years, 63% men and 37% women, were recruited. Headache of any kind was reported in 70 patients (40.2%) and 37 (21.3%) assessed the headache as moderate/severe. Six patients stopped medication due to headache. A subsiding character of the headache was found with a mean of 3.1 days. Patients with TIA had a significantly higher risk of getting headache compared to manifest stroke, regardless of localization. There was a trend towards higher risk in younger age groups and females. No effect was seen on the number of days since stroke onset.
The new tapping board was as sensitive as the standard board to distinguish untreated PD patients from controls. The relative improvements in tapping scores from the off treatment condition were largest for the proximal tapping task. The treatment effects of high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or medication alone were comparable, whereas the combined treatment induced significantly higher tapping scores.
Intraclass coefficients (ICC) showed low to moderate agreement among informants. Furthermore, the level of agreement was generally less among patients suffering from internalizing disorders than for young patients who displayed externalizing disorders. Logistic regression revealed that the TRF internalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL internalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of internalizing disorders in youth. The YSR internalizing syndrome scale, on the other hand, was not a relevant factor among adolescents of a clinical target population. Likewise, only the TRF externalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL externalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of externalizing disorders in youth.
Following the exposure to their own body image, BN showed an increase in body dissatisfaction, which was associated with the increase in the rCBF of the Right Temporal Area. Those changes persisted at follow-up.
At 24 months, treatment retention (81.8% for RLAI versus 63.4% for oral APs, p&lt;0.0001) and reduction in Clinical Global Impression Severity scores (-1.14 for RLAI versus -0.94 for APs, p=0.0165) were significantly higher with RLAI. Compared to the pre-switch period, RLAI patients had greater reductions in the number (reduction of 0.37 stays per patient versus 0.2, p&lt;0.05) and days (18.74 versus 13.02, p&lt;0.01) of hospitalizations at 24 months than oral AP patients.
According to the SCID, 44 patients were suffering from bipolar spectrum disorder and 102 from unipolar disorder (37 patients dropped out). The MDQ provided high specificity (83.3%). Sensitivity was 63.6%, with better identification of bipolar I (85.0%) than bipolar II patients (45.8%). In the whole sample, test-retest reliability was satisfactory (kappa=0.64). Modest correlations were observed between the number of endorsed MDQ items and YMRS scores at time 1 (Spearman r=0.19; p=0.021) and time 2 (r=0.26; p=0.002).
In the bivariate analysis, the following variables showed statistical significance (p&lt;0.20) to enter the regression model: being woman (p=0.074), greater insight (p=0.017) and better quality of life (QOL) in all domains before treatment (p=0.053), overall severity of disease according to the CGI (p=0.007), number of associated comorbidities (p=0.063), social phobia (p=0.044), and dysthymia (p=0.072). In the final regression model, these variables were associated with response to GCBT: female gender (p=0.021); WHOQOL-BREF psychological domain (p=0.011); insight (p=0.042); and global improvement score of the CGI severity-scale before therapy (p=0.045).
Results indicated significant positive self-esteem module effects on self-esteem, self-assertion, active coping strategies and symptom for the participants receiving case-management care. Results were not significant for those receiving traditional care. However, 71% of all participants expressed satisfaction with the module.
46 (39.7%) subjects had never used cannabis, 23 (19.9%) had done so sporadically/frequently, and 47 (40.5%) daily. A1T differed between the three groups (mean, in years and [SD]: 27.0 [4.94]; 25.7 [4.44] and 24.5 [4.36]; p=0.033) and diminished as cannabis use increased (linear tendency; p=0.009). Post-hoc analysis showed that cannabis use (irrespective of frequency) was significantly associated with decrease in A1T (p=0.033), as shown by the first contrast [1 -1/2 -1/2]. Post-hoc contrast showed that cannabis users had a significantly lower age of onset of psychosis (mean decrease, in years: 1.93; CI (confidence interval) 95%: 0.17-3.70; p=0.033).
We found that 13% of the women studied showed high postnatal depressive symptomatology, which is very similar to rates of prevalence of postnatal depression in the first year after the birth of the child reported in other Western World studies. Feeling anxious during pregnancy is a strong predictor of high symptoms of depression at 6-8 weeks after delivery. However, University education and friends' support appear to be important protective factors.
A history of suicide attempt was a significant risk factor (IRR 4.9; 95% CI 2.1-11.6). Loss of job during the year prior to the index admission was associated with an increase in suicide risk (IRR: 2.9; 95% CI 1.2-7.5). Clinical improvement during the index admission (IRR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.7), and treatment with antidepressant drugs at the censoring date (IRR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.7) were associated with a decrease in suicide risk.
Post-interventional imaging in our patient demonstrated that after both interventions, a stellar-like structure of vital tumor tissue had remained within the coagulation necrosis. This was the starting point of a fast and progressive tumor recurrence. We suspect heat-sink effects of blood vessels in the highly vascularized metastasis to cause the tumor recurrence. In literature, there are only a few reports of RFA in ACC patients. In addition, there is no large randomized trial investigating the efficacy of RFA against surgery in those patients.
According to UIE, maternal iodine deficiency (55%) associated with neonatal iodine overload (65%) had came to attention. Although mean urinary iodine levels in both mother groups were similar, the mean urinary levels of borderline hypothyroidic and euthyroid groups were 432+/-129 microg/l and 271.5+/-137 microg/l, respectively. Iodine overload was also presence in newborn with normal thyroid function tests.
Overall amputation and minor amputation rates were similar for both periods. However, major amputations were observed to be decreased after starting the Dokuz Eylul University multidisciplinary diabetic foot care team (20.4% vs. 12.6%, p=0.026).
There were more TUNEL-positive nuclei in diabetic kidneys than in control kidneys. At 24 weeks, experimental diabetes was associated with a considerable increase in protein expression of GRP78, phospho-eIF2 alpha, phospho-PERK, and caspase-12 in the tubulointestitium. ACE inhibitor not only attenuated the apoptosis but also reduced the overexpression of these endoplasmic reticulum stress associated proteins in tubulointestitium of diabetic rats.
A significantly increasing percentage of pediatric patients in all age groups with Type 1 Diabetes use analogue insulins. In 2007, 48.5% used SA, 45.8% LA. 87.2% of pumps were running with short acting analogue. Age specific analysis: A: 2000: 9.1%SA, 0.7%LA vs. 2007: 50.0%SA, 10.0%LA; B: 2000:5.6%SA, 1.4%LA vs. 2007: 36.8%SA, 27.5%LA C: 2000:14.3%SA, 3.4%LA vs. 2007: 45.3%SA, 49.1%LA D: 2000:26.3%SA, 3.2%LA vs. 2007: 59.1%SA, 61.9%LA. This increase in usage of analogues was also found at onset of diabetes. Corrected for age, center and diabetes duration HbA1c was significantly lower in the group with regular insulin (8.18+/-0.047%) than with SA (8.32+/-0.048%) (p&lt;0.0001) and BMI-SDS was only marginal lower in the group with regular insulin (0.45+/-0.01 kg/m (2)) than with SA (0.47+/-0.15) (p&gt;0.007). Similar differences in HbA1c (8.09+/-0.05% vs. 8.40+/-0.05%) and BMI-SDS where seen when NPH was compared with LA respectively. After change to SA the reduction of severe hypoglycemia with (6.1/100 pat.years) and without coma (6.2/100 pat.years) was significant and after change to LA for severe hypoglycemia without coma respectively.
Prevalence of DM was 8.06+/-0.9% (7.15+/-1.25 M and 8.94+/-1.3 F) including 5.56+/-0.77% (5.56+/-1.13 M and 5.56+/-1.06 F) with known and 2.52+/-0.55 (1.59+/-0.64 M and 3.37+/-0.89 F) newly diagnosed. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT and/or IFG) was found in additional 8.44+/-0.93% (6.09+/-1.17 M and 10.7+/-1.41 F). Extrapolated to the general population shown the prevalence 6.54+/-0.73% (5.8+/-1.02 M and 7.25+/-1.05 F). Features of the metabolic syndrome (IDF criteria) were found in 34% of the participants - 75% of patients with DM, 63% with glucose intolerance (IGT and/or IFG) and 19% of individuals with NGT (p&lt;0.001 as compared to other groups). CONCLUSIONS The study confirmed high prevalence of diabetes mellitus with lower percentage of undiagnosed disease. Presence of impaired glucose tolerance allows to identify the high risk of metabolic syndrome and in consequence high risk of cardiovascular disease.
Blood pressure was reduced to a similar extent (p &lt; 0.001) by both treatments. Albuminuria was significantly reduced by manidipine (-37.3%; p = 0.003), but not by amlodipine. C-reactive protein was reduced similarly (p &lt; 0.01) by both treatments. Plasma adiponectin was increased (32.9%; p = 0.011) and plasma TNF-alpha was reduced by manidipine (-37.1%; p = 0.019), but neither was significantly changed by amlodipine. The HOMA insulin resistance index was significantly reduced by manidipine (-21.3%; p = 0.007), but not by amlodipine (-8.3%; p = 0.062). Tolerability with manidipine was superior to that with amlodipine (p = 0.04).
Major complications and need for secondary surgical intervention were more common in the Pivotal Study arthroplasty group than the Pivotal Study ankle fusion group. In the Continued Access Group, secondary procedures performed on these arthroplasty patients decreased by half when compared with the Pivotal Arthroplasty Group. When the Pivotal Groups were compared, treatment efficacy was higher for the ankle replacement group due to improvement in functional scores. Pain relief was equivalent between fusion and replacement patients. The hypothesis of non-inferiority of ankle replacement was met for overall patient success.
Overall, 108 fusion sites went on to union (96% union rate) at a mean time of 11 weeks (as assessed by a CT scan) [ankle joint at 10 weeks; subtalar joint at 12.3 weeks; talonavicular joint at 12.7 weeks and calcaneocuboid joint at 10.9 weeks]. Different union times between ankle, subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joint were not significant (p = 0.2571, Kruskal-Wallis Test Nonparametric ANOVA). All sites: [No graft] vs. [Autograft] vs. [Allograft]: p = 0.2421 (Kruskal-Wallis Test Nonparametric ANOVA), were not statistically significant. Complications included nonunion in 5 of 112 joints in 3 patients (4% joint nonunion rate; 4% patient nonunion rate) [subtalar joint, n = 2; talonavicular joint, n = 1; and calcaneocuboid joint, n = 1]. Two patients had wound complications and one other patient had a deep infection; all were successfully treated with local wound care, negative-pressure dressings and antibiotics.
Statistically significant differences between the two groups were found in the lateral talometatarsal angle, lateral talocalcaneal angle, calcaneal pitch, first metatarsocuneiform height, the AP talonavicular coverage angle, Harris mat imprint score, subjective pes planus score, hindfoot valgus measurement from both photographs and physical examination, ankle range of motion (all with a p value less than 0.01), and the metatarsus adductus angle (p = 0.019). No patient in the control group and 14 (36%) in the flatfoot group had evidence of plantar gapping at the first metatarsocuneiform joint. In the flatfoot group, statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the Harris mat score and heel valgus as measured by photographic and physical examination, subjective pes planus grading by physical exam, the lateral talometatarsal angle, and the first metatarsocuneiform height.
Walking velocity, cadence, and step length were not significantly different between the study subjects and the normal control group. Study patients did show a significantly smaller single support time on both the affected and unaffected limbs compared to controls. There was no statistical difference in plantarflexion-dorsiflexion, varus-valgus, or ankle push-off power between the affected and unaffected sides of the study subjects, or between the affected side and the controls.
The patients answered 62% questions correctly before the multimedia presentation compared to 87% after it (p &lt; 0.001). Patients rated the ease of understanding of the multimedia module as a median 9.3 cm along a 10-cm visual analogue scale and 9.1 cm when asked whether it contained the appropriate amount of information to make a decision about surgery. Ninety percent of patients considered that the multimedia tool answered their questions about surgery as well or better than the treating surgeon.
Decreased distal phalangeal pressure and FHL weakness were demonstrated (p &lt; 0.05). No difference was noted in plantar pressure of the first or second metatarsal head. The high score on the AOFAS hallux MTP-IP scale demonstrated improved patient forefoot function after FHL transfer through a single-incision technique.
Solid arthrodesis was achieved after an average of 12.3 (eight to 26) weeks in the 16 ankles without bone graft interposed between the tibia and talus, and 14.3 (range, 8 to 26) weeks in the 13 ankles with interpositional bone allograft. Radiographs showed that the position of arthrodesis obtained at the time of surgery did not change in any patient up to one year after surgery. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hindfoot Score increased from 37 (range, 20 to 63) preoperatively to 68 (range, 50 to 92) at the last followup. Twenty-seven patients (93%) were satisfied with their outcome and indicated they would have the operation again. No complications were noted.
No significant functional impairment or malalignment were found. There were no instances of pain on metatarsal compression, or of transfer metatarsalgia with or without callus formation. A highly statistically significant improvement in AOFAS scores was found (p &lt; 0.001).
Sustained correction and solid fusion took place in all feet. Foot appearance and gait pattern of the patients were improved, while preoperative complaints were reduced. Radiographic healing was noted in all cases.
Periodic evaluations showed most patients had a gradual improvement of function over the first 2 years. Patients with early Grade IV disease had a greater propensity to develop early recurrence of their dorsal osteophyte at or before their mid-term followup (average 6 years). In this group of patients, the Futura Hemi-Great Toe Implants lead to 88% good to excellent mid-term results and 88% patient satisfaction over a 6-year average followup.
A total of 72 articles were identified, five of which met the inclusion criteria. These included one randomized controlled trial, three retrospective studies, and one prospective case series.
There is good evidence that early motion is associated with a quicker return to work on average (p = 0.008) and also with an improved range of motion at 12 weeks (dorsiflexion p = 0.001; plantarflexion p &lt; 0.00001) compared to cast immobilization. However it is also associated with an increased risk of wound infection (p = 0.002). There is a suggestion that early motion results in a lower rate of deep vein thrombosis (p = 0.12). There is no evidence that it results in improved joint specific outcome scores or range of motion at 1 year.
The average pain score (VAS) improved from 8.7 to 2.4 (p &lt; 0.001) and the average Puddu level of disability improved from 4.9 to 1.7 (p &lt; 0.001). Seventy-five percent of patients had a good or excellent outcome with 20% having sufficient improvement not to pursue further medical attention for their tendinopathy. There was a 7% rate of minor complications due to delayed wound healing which resolved spontaneously and did not affect the rehabilitation or the recovery of the patients.
There were 32 patients in group one and 22 in group two. Groups were similar in age, gender and diagnosis. At 6 weeks, group one had 94.1% bridging bone, as measured on AP radiographs. Group two had 76.4% bridging bone. (Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.0099). At 12 weeks, group one had 98.1% bridging bone and group two had 85.7% bridging bone (Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.026).
Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated a statistically significant linear relationship between DAM/E1 r = 0.931, p &lt; 0.001 but not between DAM/E2 r = 0.519, p = 0.124. Intraclass correlation coefficient show correlation between DAM/E1 and DAM/E2 to be 0.945 (p &lt; 0.001) and 0.683 (p = 0.051). When 3 mm or more was used as the threshold to diagnose a lateral ligament rupture, sensitivity and specificity were E1(100%, 100%) and E2(75%, 50%).
The specimens used had a mean bone mineral density of 0.49 +/- 0.15 (SD) g/cm(2), and a mean age of 83 +/- 12 years. In the biomechanical tests, there were no significant differences between augmented and non-augmented locking plates without the tibia-pro-fibula screws in axial stiffness (p = 0.10), external rotation angle at failure (p = 0.42), failure torque (p = 0.57), energy absorbed before failure (p = 0.47), and motion at the fracture site with cyclic axial loading (p = 0.15). There were no significant differences between augmented and non-augmented locking plates with the tibia-pro-fibula screws in the external rotation angle at failure (p = 0.83), failure torque (p = 0.58), and failure energy (p = 0.4). However, the overall strength of the fixation tended to increase with tibia-pro-fibula screws and augmentation.
The predominant adverse event was transient abdominal discomfort in 5 of 11 patients, but in 2, both suffering from Crohns disease, it progressed to abdominal pain and led to discontinuation of GLP-2 treatment. One had a fibrostenotic lesion electively resected at the jejuno-ascendo-anastomosis. The investigator excluded a patient due to unreliable feedback. Stoma nipple enlargement was seen in all 9 jejunostomy patients. Reported GLP-2 compliance was excellent (&gt;93%). GLP-2 improved the overall quality of life VAS-score (4.1 +/- 2.8 cm versus 6.0 +/- 2.4 cm, P &lt; .01), the overall SIP score (10.3 +/- 8.9% versus 6.2 +/- 9.5%, P &lt; .001), the mental component of the SF-36 (45 +/- 13% versus 53 +/- 11%, P &lt; .05), and the overall IBDQ score (5.1 +/- 0.9 versus 5.4 +/- 0.9, P &lt; .007) in the 8 patients completing the study.
Prediction of breeding values of unrelated individuals required a substantially higher marker density and number of training records than when prediction individuals were offspring of training individuals. However, when the number of records was 2*Ne*L and the number of markers was 10*Ne*L, the breeding values of unrelated individuals could be predicted with accuracies of 0.88 - 0.93, where Ne is the effective population size and L the genome size in Morgan. Reducing this requirement to 1*Ne*L individuals, reduced prediction accuracies to 0.73-0.83.
For almost all age groups, Cronbach's alpha exceeded the minimum value of the original study (0.86). Principal components analysis revealed a two-factor solution (speech perception/production). The fitting of a nonparametric regression line to the data points showed that the total FAPCI score was positively associated with the time of implant use.
The NL revealed speech understanding close to 100% even for small differences in f0 of 40 Hz or level differences of 5 dB. In CI recipients, a significant change in intelligibility could only be demonstrated with increased TMR, but not with differences in f0.
Controlled studies addressing the complications of ear wax removal are lacking in the literature and absolute risks could not be reported. Perforation of the tympanic membrane was observed in up to 1% of the cases. Syringing seems to result in a greater number of complications than mechanical removal using a curette.
PET-CT is widely used in pre-operative tumours staging for colorectal liver metastases. There is convincing data that it may also be applicable for neuroendocrine tumours, assessment of indeterminate pancreas lesions and clinical drug trials. PET-CT is of limited value in hepatocellular cancers, although new techniques in dual-tracer PET-CT may change this.
The R1 rate was high in pancreatic (82%) and bile duct (72%) cancer and significantly lower in ampullary cancer (25%). Margin positivity was often multifocal, the posterior margin being most frequently involved. Margin status correlated with survival in the entire cohort (P = 0.006) and the pancreatic subgroup (P = 0.046). These findings were consistent with observations in our previous study.
POF was the most common peri-operative complication. POF was identified in 32 out of 169 patients (19%). Transection technique (hand sewn, stapled, stapled with mesh) and procedure complexity were factors associated with differences in POF rates by both univariate and multivariate analyses. POF was identified in 7 out of 70 patients (10%) when an absorbable mesh was utilized, and 25 of 99 patients (25%) when mesh was not utilized (P &lt; 0.02).
Median blood loss was 260 ml. The median total operative time was 150 min and median transection time was 35 min. No patient required more than 2 days of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. The median hospital stay was 8 days. Surgical complications included two (3%) cases of bile leak, two (3%) cases of pneumonia, two (3%) cases with wound infection and two (3%) cases with pleural effusion. The peri-operative mortality was zero. In a 30-month median follow-up, all patients with benign lesions were alive and free of disease. The 3-year disease-free survival for patients with HCC was 61% (57% for patients with colorectal metastases) and the 3-year survival 72% (68% for patients with colorectal metastases).
ACE gene I and D allele frequency of patients (44% and 56%) were similar to controls (45% and 55%, respectively). There were no significant differences in severity of pancreatitis between patients with the ACE-insertion or ACE-insertion/deletion versus ACE-deletion genotypes.
Thirty-five patients (76%) were initially treated non-operatively and 11 (24%) patients had immediate surgery. In four (11%) patients, NOM failed and the patients required surgery 8-72 h after admission. Patients failing non-operative care had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure on admission as compared with patients with successful NOM (P = 0.001). Patients immediately operated upon had higher ISS (P &lt; 0.001) and were haemodynamically unstable to a greater extent (P &lt; 0.001) as compared with patients initially considered for NOM. Operated patients had increased transfusion requirements (P &lt; 0.001), longer total hospital stay (P = 0.011) and stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) unit (P &lt; 0.001) as compared with NOM. One immediately operated and one failed NOM died (total mortality 4%). Seventeen patients in the NOM group were successfully treated without surgery despite the presence of at least one described risk factor.
Overall, 39 patients (10%) required immediate pre-operative hospitalization, 22 (56%) of which were transferred from another hospital. The most common indications were pancreatitis, gastric outlet obstruction, intractable abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. During a 1- to 2-week hospitalization, 51% of patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), 36% were administered parenteral nutrition, 20% received antibiotics and 15% were transfused blood products. Yet, this pre-operative scenario, at a median cost of $7250 per patient, had no measurable impact on operative performance. Post-operatively, non-elective patients suffered more complications and a higher (O/E) ratio (1.00 vs. 0.93). These outcomes resulted in significantly more deviations from our carepath and an additional $7000 per non-elective case.
Aquaporin 9 was predominantly expressed in the membranes of hepatocytes and demonstrated zonal distribution relative to hepatic sinusoid structure in normal liver. In HCC arising in the absence of cirrhosis AQP 9 remained membrane-localized with zonal distribution in the majority of NTL. By contrast, AQP 9 expression was significantly decreased in the HCC mass vs. pair-matched NTL. In HCC in the presence of cirrhosis, NTL was characterized by extensive AQP 9 staining in the membrane in the absence of zonal distribution and AQP 9 staining in NTL was significantly greater than that observed in the tumour mass.
Patients included 35 men and 50 women with a median age of 61 years. Types of surgery included: hepatectomy (65.9%); hepatectomy plus drainage (9.4%); drainage alone (14.1%), and percutaneous choledochoscopy (10.6%). There was no operative mortality. Complications occurred in 40% of patients and half the complications involved wound infections. The overall incidences of residual stone, stone recurrence and biliary sepsis recurrence were 21.2%, 16.5% and 21.2%, respectively, over a median follow-up of 45.4 months. The drainage-alone group and percutaneous choledochoscopy group had higher incidences of residual stone, stone recurrence and biliary sepsis recurrence. In hepatectomy patients, regardless of whether or not a drainage procedure had been performed, rates of residual stone, stone recurrence and biliary sepsis recurrence were 15.6%, 7.8% and 9.4%, respectively, over a median follow-up of 42.7 months.
The median follow-up was 6.55 years (range 2.96-20.93 years). Pre-LTx factors associated with better survival include tumour size &lt; or = 5 cm, number of tumours &lt; or = 3, staging within Milan and UCSF Criteria and more recent transplantation (1996-2003). In all, 14 patients had a pre-LTx stage outside the Milan but within the UCSF Criteria. One- and 5-year patient survival rates were, respectively, 88% and 74% within the Milan Criteria, and 87% and 73% within the UCSF Criteria. Vascular invasion, capsular invasion, lymph node invasion and pathological stage outside UCSF Criteria were associated with poor outcome. Of patients within the Milan and UCSF Criteria pre-LTx, 24% and 18%, respectively, were outside the same criteria post-LTx. These patients had poorer survival rates.
A total of 141 patients underwent retroperitoneal necrosectomy, of whom 58 (41%) had complications and 18 (13%) required laparotomy. There were 22 (16%) deaths. Overall, 157 patients underwent endoscopic necrosectomy; major complications were reported in 31 (20%) and death in seven (5%). Laparoscopic necrosectomy was carried out in 46 patients, of whom five (11%) required laparotomy and three (7%) died.
CRLM were bilateral in 69% (NC(+)) and 57% (NC(-)), and synchronous in 84% (NC(+)) and 14% (NC(-)). The FRL hypertrophy rate was 54.1% (NC(+)) and 43.7% (NC(-)) (P= 0.3). CRLM were unresectable in four of our 20 patients, i.e. group NC(+): one insufficient FRL hypertrophy and one severe steatosis; and group NC(-): two tumoral progressions. In both groups, the operative parameters were comparable except for pedicular clamping: 8 (NC(+)) and 36 min (NC(-)), respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Also, the surgical outcome rate and hospital stay were comparable. No significant pathological difference was observed between the two groups. No mortality occurred in either group.
RIPC reduced the effects of IRI by significantly increasing red blood cell velocity, sinusoidal flow and sinusoidal perfusion along with decreased neutrophil adhesion and cell death.
We identified a total of 56 patients, of whom 33 underwent endoscopic stenting and 23 underwent a surgical bypass consisting of a hepaticojejunostomy-en-Y and a gastrojejunostomy. There were no significant differences in complication or mortality rates between patients undergoing palliative stenting and those undergoing palliative surgery. However, after excluding admissions for chemotherapy-related problems, the number of readmissions expressed as a percentage of the group population size was greater in stented patients compared with biliary bypass patients (39.4% vs. 13.0%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Overall survival amongst patients undergoing palliative bypass was significantly greater than in stented patients (382 days vs. 135 days, respectively; P &lt; 0.05).
Overall, 35 patients with AHC underwent Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; right hepatectomy was performed in one patient. The interval between bile duct injury and stricture repair did not influence the development of AHC (mean 24 months in AHC patients vs. 19 months in non-AHC patients; P= 0.522). Of the 36 patients with AHC, 26 (72%) had hilar strictures (Bismuth's types III, IV, V), as did 163 of the 326 (50%) patients without AHC (P= 0.012). Patients with AHC had more blood loss at surgery (mean blood loss 340 ml in the AHC group vs. 190 ml in the non-AHC group; P= 0.004) and required more blood transfusion (mean blood transfused 300 ml vs. 120 ml; P= 0.001). Surgery was prolonged in AHC patients (mean duration of operation 4.2 hours in the AHC group vs. 2.8 hours in the non-AHC group; P= 0.001). Over a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 6-163 months), three of 36 (8%) AHC patients required re-intervention for recurrent strictures, compared with nine of 326 (3%) non-AHC patients (P= 0.006).
A total of 208 claims following laparoscopic procedures in general surgery were reported to NHSLA during 2000-2005, of which 133 (64%) were related to LC. Bile duct injury (BDI) accounted for the majority of claims (72%); bowel injury and 'others' accounted for 9% and 19%, respectively. Only 20% of BDIs were recognized during surgery; the majority were missed and diagnosed later. Claims related to LC resulted in payments totalling 6 m pound sterling, of which 4.3 m pound sterling was paid out for BDIs. The average cost was higher for patients who suffered a delay in diagnosis, as was the chance of a successful claim.
A total of 18 lesions (in 12 patients) represented metastatic colorectal cancer. Three lesions (in two patients) were hepatocellular carcinoma. Four lesions (in two patients) represented locally advanced symptomatic gallbladder cancer invading the liver bed or symptomatic intrahepatic liver metastases from gallbladder cancer. One lesion was benign hepatic adenoma. Mean tumour size was 3.07 +/- 1.42 cm. Mean ablation time was 358 +/- 120 sec. No major complications were observed in the &lt; or = 30-day or &gt;30-day periods post-RFA.
Thirteen patients were treated by laparoscopic liver resections in the ERAS programme in one centre (group 1). Their outcomes were compared with outcomes of 13 laparoscopic procedures performed either before the introduction of the ERAS programme during 2003-2005 in the same centre or during the same period in other centres using traditional care (group 2). Median total LOS was 5.0 days (range 3-10 days) in group 1 and 7.0 days (3-12 days) in group 2. This difference was not statistically significant. Functional recovery occurred 2 days earlier in group 1 (median 3.0 days [range 1-7 days] vs. median 5.0 days [range 2-8 days]; P &lt; 0.044). There were no significant differences in complications, conversions or duration of operation. Blood loss was significantly less in the ERAS group (median 50 ml [range 50-200 ml] vs. median 250 ml [range 50-800 ml]; P &lt; 0.002).
A total of 18 patients, of whom 13 had malignant tumours (12 colorectal metastases and one hepatocellular carcinoma) and five had benign tumours (two hepatic adenomas and three haemangiomas) underwent 18 hepatic procedures, including two formal hemi-hepatectomies, four left lateral sections, three posterior sections and nine atypical non-anatomic resections. Estimated blood loss did not differ from institutional historical control data; no postoperative haemorrhage, bile leaks or hepatic abscess or necrosis were identified (n = 18).
The four patients with gastrointestinal bleeding had RCC metastases that had eroded into the duodenum and were successfully controlled by palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy or completion pancreatectomy. The other two patients were treated using different chemotherapeutic or biological agents.
There was no mortality in our series. The postoperative morbidity rate was 32% (16/50), with major complications occurring in seven (14%) patients. Pancreatic leak occurred in one patient (2%) and bile leak in one patient (2%). Both patients were managed conservatively.
We found ARHAA in 31 of 191 patients (16.2%). Operative management included dissection and preservation in 24, transection and reconstruction in four, and transection and primary anastomosis in three patients. Reconstruction of ARHAA was carried out through interposition grafts in two patients and implantation into the gastroduodenal stump in two patients. No cases of arterial thrombosis, liver infarction, abscess formation or biliary fistula were demonstrated in the immediate postoperative period. Review of preoperative imaging interpretations found that only nine of 23 reports indicated the presence of ARHAA; however, the retrospective review of the images found that ARHAA was readily apparent in 24 patients.
The median time lapse between the onset of AP and death was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR] 17 days); that between the onset of organ dysfunction and death was 3 days (IQR 7 days). There was no apparent bimodal distribution. The majority of patients had single- (384 patients) or two-system (242 patients) extrapancreatic organ dysfunction. Pulmonary dysfunction was most prevalent (30% of organ-specific entries, 198/660), followed by cardiovascular (18%, 117/660), renal (16%, 108/660), liver (11%, 71/660), gastrointestinal (9%, 59/660), haemorrhage (6%, 38/660), coagulopathy (5%, 31/660) and central nervous system (6%, 38/660) dysfunction.
Twenty-two patients had thoracobiliary (pleurobiliary, n = 19; bronchobiliary, n = 3) fistulae. The site of the bile duct injury was identified in 20 patients on cholangiography. These 20 patients underwent either sphincterotomy and biliary stenting (n = 18) or sphincterotomy alone (n = 2). In 17 patients the fistulae resolved after the initial endoscopic intervention. Three patients required secondary stenting with replacement of the initial stent. Three patients developed mild pancreatitis after stenting and one stent migrated and was replaced. All fistulae healed after endoscopic treatment. In 18 patients the stents were removed 4 weeks after bile drainage ceased. Three of the 22 patients required a thoracotomy for infected loculated pleural collections after initial catheter drainage.
The mucosal bridge technique was performed in 16 (3.19%) of 501 patients. Success rates were 75% and 100% after first and second ERCPs, respectively. The failure of initial procedures was caused by bleeding, tissue oedema, poorly visualized papilla or a poorly distensible duodenum and oedematous papilla. There were four cases of complications, which included periductular extravasation of contrast, bleeding, and sepsis in two patients. However, these complications were not a direct consequence of the precut sphincterotomy.
Successful intervention was seen in 85.6% of patients with acute cholecystitis. A total of 40% of patients treated with PC were later cholecystectomized, with a mortality rate of 1.96%. Procedure mortality was 0.36%, but 30-day mortality rates were 15.4 % in patients treated with PC and 4.5% in those treated with acute cholecystectomy (P &lt; 0.001).
Thirty-five patients (30%) developed a PF. Amongst these, 20 were managed conservatively and 14 were reoperated. These two groups of patients were compared with patients without a PF for analysis. There was no significant difference in the mean age, the gender ratio, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, surgical time and blood replacement, number of associated procedures, vascular resection and type of reconstruction between the three groups. There were five post-operative deaths (4.2%), three patients (21.4%) in the surgical treatment group (P &lt; 0.01). Mean total number of complications (P= 0.02) and mean length of hospital stay (P &lt; 0.001) were greater in the surgical group. The medium delay between the pancreatic resection and reoperation was 10 days (range, 3-32 days). Completion splenopancreatectomy was required in five patients whereas conservative treatment including debridement and drainage was applied in nine patients.
Sixty-five patients (mean age 49.9 years) had final diagnoses of chronic pancreatitis +/- pseudocyst (n= 22), benign cystadenoma (n= 15), neuroendocrine tumour (n= 8), primary pancreatic carcinoma (n= 6) and 14 other conditions. DP performed for presumed cystic neoplasm (n= 24) revealed a correct pre-operative diagnosis in 71% of patients. Histological examination confirmed that 59% of resected cystic tumours were either malignant or had malignant potential. When DP was undertaken for presumed pseudocyst (n= 12), 83% of cases were correctly diagnosed pre-operatively. Overall mortality and morbidity rates were 3% and 39%, respectively, with five patients (8%) developing a clinically significant pancreatic fistula. Ten (17%) patients developed diabetes mellitus and nine (14%) required long-term pancreatic exocrine supplementation.
POPF encountered in PD were 11 cases (25.6%). Operation time and degree of fibrosis of remnant pancreatic cut surface were related to POPF (P= 0.030, P= 0.010). The pancreas-liver SI ratio (PLSI) between fistula group and no fistula group was -0.0009 +/- 0.2 and -0.1297 +/- 0.2, respectively (P= 0.0004). The pancreas-spleen SI ratio (PSSI) in each group was 0.423 +/- 0.25 and 0.288 +/- 0.32, respectively (P= 0.014). Using quantitative analysis, the SI ratios were 1.27 and 0.66 in each group (P= 0.013).
The overall incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 3.9% (29 of 740 procedures). The risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis were: being female (6.5%; odds ratio [OR] 2.5, P= 0.02); first EBD procedure without endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) (6.9%; OR 3.0, P= 0.003), and performing additional diagnostic procedures on the pancreatobiliary duct (9.6%; OR 4.6, P &lt; 0.0001). Pancreatitis after subsequent draining procedures was rare (0.4%; OR for first-time drainage 16.6, P= 0.0003). Furthermore, pancreatitis was not recognized in 59 patients who underwent ES. Seven patients with post-EBD pancreatitis were treated with additional ES.
With shunting, the portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients dropped significantly, with significant increases in PI in the early period after shunting. Creatinine clearance improved in the early post-shunt period. However, SrCr levels did not significantly improve. At 1 year after shunting, both CrCl and SrCr levels tended towards pre-shunt levels and the increase in PI did not persist.
A total of 102 patients (67 with simple cysts, 31 with polycystic liver disease [PCLD], four with cystic tumours) underwent 62 laparoscopic deroofings, 15 open deroofings, 36 resections and one liver transplant between June 1985 and April 2006. The median follow-up was 77 months (range 3-250 months). Morbidity and recurrent symptom rates after laparoscopic surgery were greater in PCLD patients compared with simple cyst patients, at 31% (four patients) vs. 15% (seven patients) and 85% (11 patients) vs. 29% (24 patients), respectively. Four patients with simple cysts and eight with PCLD required further surgery. All patients with simple cysts had comparable quality of life after surgery. Patients with recurrent symptoms after surgery for PCLD had a significantly better quality of life following laparoscopic deroofing than after resection.
Between 1991 and 2006, 11 patients (four male; median age 51 years) underwent simultaneous LT and total pancreatectomy (n = 4) or pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 7). Indications included metastatic neuroendocrine tumour (n = 5), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), metastatic periampullary adenocarcinoma (n = 1), periampullary adenocarcinoma with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) (n = 2) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with ESLD (n = 1). The three patients with ESLD had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis or cryptogenic cirrhosis. Median postoperative length of stay was 31 days (21-110 days). Overall median survival was 101 months (95% confidence interval 70.6-131.4). One-year survival was 91%, 2-year 90%, 5-year 67% and 10-year 33%. Postoperative complications included: re-operation (n = 4); anastamotic leak (n = 2); abdominal abscess (n = 3), and organ rejection (n = 1).
Commonest indication for resection was colorectal metastasis (54%), 71% of all resections were for malignancy. Average operating time was 2 h 31 min (range 30 min-7 h, 15 min). Major morbidity consisted of one bile leak, two subphrenic abscesses and one pulmonary embolus. There were no deaths. Conversion to open was required in 20% and two patients required intra-operative blood transfusions. Average length of stay overall was 6.1 days (range 1-27), but as low as 2 days for some left lateral sectionectomies. Cessation of parenteral analgesia, return to normal diet and full mobility were achieved on average at 2.4, 2.3 and 2.8 days. Significant post-operative liver dysfunction was seen in two patients, which returned to normal by discharge. One patient died of disease progression 4 months after surgery. There were two involved margins in 35 patients (6%).
Median age at surgery was 10.7 years (range 0.3-22.0 years). Indications included: (i) refractory gastrointestinal bleeding in portal hypertension associated with (a) compensated cirrhosis (n= 12), (b) portal vein thrombosis (n= 10), (c) hepatoportal sclerosis (n= 3); (ii) refractory ascites secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome (n= 3), and (iii) familial hypercholesterolaemia (n= 4). There were 20 distal splenorenal, four portacaval, three Rex bypass, two mesocaval, two mesoatrial and one proximal splenorenal shunts. At the last follow-up (median 2.9 years, range 0.1-14.1 years), one shunt (Rex bypass) was thrombosed. Two patients had died and two had required a liver transplant. These had a patent shunt at last imaging prior to death or transplant.
Of the 215 open liver resections performed during the study period, 47 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean patient age was 61 years; 34% were female. The majority required resection for malignant disease (94%); frequent indications included colorectal metastasis (66%), hepatocellular carcinoma (6%) and cholangiocarcinoma (4%). Right hemihepatectomy (49%), left hemihepatectomy (13%) and right trisectionectomy (13%) were the most frequently performed procedures. A total of 26 patients (55%) underwent a major ancillary procedure concurrently. There were no operative mortalities. Median operative time was 220 min (range 97-398 min). Inflow occlusion was required in nine patients (19%) for a median time of 12 min (range 3-30 min). Median total estimated blood loss was 400 ml (range 10-2000 ml) and 10 patients (21%) required perioperative transfusion. All patients had macroscopically negative margins. Median length of stay was 8 days. Two patients (4%) had clinically significant bile leak. The 30-day postoperative mortality was zero.
The hepatocellular injury of I/R produced a markedly elevated serum AST which was reduced with bucillamine (2072.5 +/- 511.79 vs. 932 +/- 200.8, P &lt; 0.05) at 3 h reperfusion. Bucillamine treatment with I/R also increased parenchymal blood flow [red blood cell (RBC) velocity 242.66 +/- 16.86 vs. 181.11 +/- 17.59, at the end of 3 h of reperfusion) and reduced hepatocyte necrosis/apoptosis at 3 h as well as 24 h (P &gt; 0.001).
Significant (multipoint HLOD &gt;or=3.2) or genome-wide-significant (HLOD &gt;or=4.02) linkage results were found for regions 1q32, 2p13, 3q27-28, 9q21, 12p11, 14q21-24 and 16q24. SNPs in IRF6 (1q32) and in or near FOXE1 (9q21) reached formal genome-wide wFDR-adjusted significance. Further, results were phenotype dependent in that the IRF6 region results were most significant for families in which affected individuals have CL alone, and the FOXE1 region results were most significant in families in which some or all of the affected individuals have CL with CP.
Recombination activity in PAR1 is on average 7-fold higher in male than in female meiosis, resulting in a much larger genetic map for males. This new map shows how genetically different in size is the X chromosome between males and females.
Effect estimates from family history measures that used multiple family members were more accurate than those derived from measures based on a single relative. Neither family size nor age of family members defining family history were confounders in the case-control design.
These data lend further support to a genetic component contributing to birth timing since sporadic (i.e. no familial resemblance) and nontransmission (i.e. environmental factors alone contribute to gestational age) models are strongly rejected. Analyses of gestational age attributed to the infant support a model in which mother's genome and/or maternally-inherited genes acting in the fetus are largely responsible for birth timing, with a smaller contribution from the paternally-inherited alleles in the fetal genome.
Multiple hierarchical regression analyses indicated that TPB variables explained 60% of the variance in intention. The addition of other psychosocial variables in the model added 7% of the explained variance. The final model included perceived behavioral control (beta = .38, p &lt; .0001), moral norm (beta = .29, p &lt; .0001), and attitude (beta = .14, p &lt; .01).
There were significant differences in race/ethnicity composition and socio-economic factors between NPL host census tracts and non-host census tracts in Florida. The percentages of Blacks (OR = 5.7, p &lt; 0.001), the percentage of Hispanic/Latino (OR = 5.84, p &lt; 0.001), and percent employed in blue collar occupations (OR = 2.7, p &lt; 0.01) were significant predictors of location of NPL facilities.
The ordinary least squares linear regression found weak relationships in both the park acreage density and the physical activity site density models (R(a)(2) = .11 and .23, respectively; AIC = 7162 and 3529, respectively). Geographically weighted regression, however, suggested spatial non-stationary in both models, indicating disparities in accessibility that vary over space with respect to magnitude and directionality of the relationships (AIC = 2014 and -1241, respectively). The qualitative analysis supported the findings of the local regression, confirming that although there is a geographically inequitable distribution of park space and physical activity sites, it is not globally predicted by race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status.
The hotspot maps produced by the LISA and KD techniques showed spatial trend patterns of diarrhea diffusion. Villages in the middle and northern regions revealed higher incidences. Also, the spatial patterns of diarrhea during the years 2001 and 2006 were found to represent spatially clustered patterns, both at global and local scales.
Thirteen multidisciplinary teams participated in the project. In total 101 health professionals were involved, and 536 patients were diagnosed. Overall 356 patients (66%) were considered non-severely depressed and 180 (34%) patients showed severe symptoms. The mean percentage of non-severe patients treated according to the stepped care model was 78%, and 57% for the severely depressed patient group. The proportion of non-severely depressed patients receiving a first step treatment according to the stepped care model, improved during the project, this was not the case for the severely depressed patients. The teams were able to monitor depression symptoms to a reasonable extent during a period of 6 months. Within 3 months, 28% of monitored patients had recovered, meaning a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of 10 and lower, and another 27% recovered between 3 and 6 months.
Factors facilitating the implementation of the collaborative care model are continuous supervision of the care managers by the consultant psychiatrist and the trainers, a supportive web-based tracking system and the new reimbursement system that allows for introduction of a mental health care-practice nurse (MHC-PN) in the general practices and coverage of the treatment costs. Impeding factors might be the relatively high percentage of solo-primary care practices, the small percentage of professionals that are located in the same building, unfamiliarity with the concept of collaboration as required for collaborative care, the reimbursement system that demands regular negotiations between each health care provider and the insurance companies and the reluctance general practitioners might feel to expand their responsibility for their depressed patients.
Despite the large number of articles discussing integration, significant gaps in the research literature exist. There was a lack of high quality, empirical studies providing evidence on how health systems can improve service delivery and population health. No universal definition or concept of integration was found and multiple integration models from both the healthcare and business literature were proposed in the literature. The review also revealed a lack of standardized, validated tools that have been systematically used to evaluate integration outcomes. This makes measuring and comparing the impact of integration on system, provider and patient level challenging.
Among 955 live births prenatally exposed to lopinavir/ritonavir, 23 cases with birth defects were reported [2.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5 to 3.6). Among 267 live births with first-trimester exposures, 5 had birth defects (1.9%, 95% CI = 0.6 to 4.3). These rates are similar to the population-based comparator rate of 2.67% and the rate in infants with second/third-trimester exposures (2.6%, 95% CI = 1.6 to 4.1). No pattern of birth defects suggestive of a common etiology was seen.
HIV is effectively controlled through NSP distribution of sterile syringes {with the effective reproduction ratio below 1 [0.66 median, interquartile range (0.63-0.70)] under current syringe distribution}. In contrast, HCV incidence is expected to remain high and its control is not feasible in the foreseeable future. The proportion of injections that are shared and the number of times each syringe is used before disposal are the driving factors of HCV incidence. The frequency in which each syringe is used can potentially be influenced by changes in syringe distribution. We estimate that if syringe distribution or coverage doubled, then annual incidence is likely to reduce by 50%. However, if it was decreased to one third of the current level, then approximately 3 times the incidence could be expected.
The BED-CEIA and Vironostika-LS concurred in 90% of specimen classifications (Kappa = 0.77; "good" strength of agreement). Predictors of recent HIV-1 infection common to both methods were unprotected receptive anal intercourse (P &lt; 0.001), sex with a known HIV-positive partner (P &lt; 0.001), and amphetamine use (P &lt; 0.01). Temporal trends in HIV-1 incidence were also consistent and stable.
The prevalence of serum CMV DNA was 55.2% (150 of 272) in patients with CD4 count &lt;100/mm. In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL, CD4 count &lt;100/mm, and Karnofsky index &lt;50 were independently associated with positive serum CMV DNA at baseline. During a 3-year follow-up period, CMV viral load &gt;or=3.1 log10 copies per milliliter was significantly associated with death independently of CD4 count, other opportunistic infections, and highly active antiretroviral therapy.
Compared with controls, participants who received an HIV risk reduction intervention improved condom use at short-term, intermediate, and long-term assessments; change was better among men who have sex with men and people already infected with HIV, and when interventions provided intensive content across multiple sessions. Intervention participants reduced their number of sexual partners in interventions with intensive interpersonal skills training and in younger samples, especially at delayed intervals.
HIV partnership discordance was associated with injection drug use but was generally not associated with sexual behaviors including multiple partnerships and sex trade. herpes simplex virus-2 and chlamydia partnership discordance were associated with multiple partnerships, sex trade, and same sex partnership history. Additional correlates of sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV-discordant partnerships included older age (&gt;or=25 years), noninjection drug use, and incarceration history. Analyses suggested that screening tools composed of CDC-recommended sexual risk and injection drug indicators plus indicators of older age, noninjection drug use, and incarceration were more effective in identifying STI/HIV priority populations than tools composed of CDC indicators alone.
During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, the incidence of non-AIDS events was higher than that of cART-related and AIDS-defining events (10.5, 3.6, and 2.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively). Bacterial (mainly airway) infections were the most frequent non-AIDS events (23.4%) followed by non-AIDS-defining malignancies and cardiovascular events (both 9.5%). Factors independently associated with the occurrence of a first non-AIDS event were age &gt;60 years [hazard ratio (HR) 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3 to 3.2] and CD4 &lt;100 cells per milliliter (HR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.8 to 3.6) but also plasma HIV RNA &gt;4 log10 copies per milliliter at the time of the event (HR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.5).
Of 2417 women, 556 (23.0%) did not report receiving a Pap test during the past year. Not having a Pap test was associated with increasing age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.3 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 to 1.4] and most recent CD4 count of &lt;200 cells per microliter (AOR = 1.6, CI: 1.1 to 2.1) or unknown (AOR = 1.4, CI: 1.1 to 1.7; both vs. CD4 count of &gt;or=200 cells/microL). Odds of a missed Pap test increased for women whose most recent pelvic exam was not performed at their usual source of HIV care (AOR = 2.6, CI: 2.1 to 3.2).
Of 683 patients who achieved virologic suppression on a first HAART regimen, 243 had virologic failure and 78 of these had a genotype resistance test done. Among these patients, the frequency of any HIV resistance mutations was 50% among patients who started HAART at 0-199 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter or 200-349 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter compared with 22% among patients who started HAART at &gt;or=350 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter (P = 0.062). The frequency of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations was 48%, 31%, and 11% among persons who initiated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing HAART within these respective CD4 cell count strata (P = 0.005). We observed similar trends for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated (P = 0.040) and protease inhibitor-associated (P = 0.063) mutations among persons initiating HAART containing these agents.
Fifty-two patients were enrolled in the trial. After 24 weeks of therapy with raltegravir, 49 (94.2%, confidence interval: 1.2% to 15.9%) patients had HIV-1 RNA levels below the limit of quantification. Patients had a median CD4 cell increase of 32 cells per cubic millimeter after 24 weeks of raltegravir therapy. Treatment satisfaction as measured by patient questionnaires improved with the raltegravir-containing regimen. Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild in nature.
Nineteen patients (19%) harbored varices requiring therapy. LS in patients with and without varices needing treatment was 48 (33-71) kPa and 32 (18-48) kPa (P = 0.004). The area under the receptor operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval) of LS for the occurrence of varices that should be treated was 0.71 (0.60 to 0.82). There was no cutoff level of LS with good positive predictive value for the presence of varices requiring therapy, but LS of 21 kPa had a negative predictive value of 100%. Twenty-six percent of patients with LS measurement and UGE showed LS &lt;21 KPa.
From 1995 through 2004, 710 of 2792 HIV-infected participants died. During this interval, the standardized mortality ratio fell from a high of 24.7 in 1996 to a plateau with a mean of 10.3 from 2001 to 2004. Over the decade, deaths from non-AIDS causes increased and accounted for the majority of deaths by 2001-2004. The most common non-AIDS causes of death were trauma or overdose, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy. Independent predictors of mortality besides HIV-associated variables were depressive symptoms and active hepatitis B or C. Women who were overweight or obese were significantly less likely to die of AIDS than women of normal weight.
The function and phenotype of NK cells were investigated using 10-color flow cytometry. Surprisingly, NK cells displayed elevated production of interferon-gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, as well as CD107a degranulation in infected subjects. This included unexpected levels of degranulation in the CD56bright subset of NK cells and high levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta in CD56negative NK cells. HIV-1 infection was associated with reduced expression of KIR2DL1, NKG2A, CD161, and NKp30 in CD56dim and CD56negative NK cells, whereas lowered CD161 expression was the only alteration in the CD56bright subset. Interestingly, low CD4 counts were associated with increased levels of interferon-gamma and degranulation in CD56bright NK cells, as well as increased NKp44 expression in the CD56dim cells.
PK of lumefantrine was influenced by LPV/r resulting in 2- to 3-fold increases in area under the curve (AUC) (AUC0-264: 413 versus 931 h.microg.mL; AUC0-inf: 456 versus 1073 h.microg.mL). For artemether, trends toward Cmax and AUC decreases (Cmax 14.3 versus 11.2 ng/mL and 42.7-62.0 versus 25.9-40.5 h.ng.mL for AUC) were noted during coadministration. For DHA, decreases in Cmax (58.8 versus 37.3 ng/mL) and AUC (190-198 versus 104-109 h.ng.mL) were observed during coadministration without changes in DHA:artemether AUC ratios. AL did not affect LPV/r PK.
Basal anterior LV free wall and the contiguous anterior ventricular septum were the most commonly hypertrophied segments (n = 256; 77%). LV hypertrophy was focal (involving &lt; or = 2 segments [&lt; or = 12% of LV]) in 41 patients (12%), intermediate (3 to 7 segments [13% to 49% of LV]) in 112 patients (34%), and diffuse (&gt; or = 8 segments [&gt; or = 50% of LV]) in 180 patients (54%); 42 patients (13%) showed hypertrophied segments separated by regions of normal thickness. The number of hypertrophied segments was greater in patients with LV outflow tract obstruction (&gt; or = 30 mm Hg) than without (10 +/- 4 vs. 8 +/- 4 per patient; p = 0.0001) and was associated with an advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.007). LV wall thickness was greater in segments with late gadolinium enhancement than without (20 +/- 6 mm vs. 16 +/- 6 mm; p &lt; 0.001). We also identified 40 (12%) of HCM patients with segmental LV hypertrophy largely confined to the anterolateral free wall, posterior septum, or apex, which was underestimated or undetected by echocardiography.
We compared 135 HCM patients with a normal ECG with 2,350 HCM patients with an abnormal ECG. The latter group was more likely to have worse symptoms, have higher gradients, and a greater degree of septal wall thickness than the patients with a normal ECG. Severe obstructive symptoms requiring surgical myectomy and implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator were more common in patients with abnormal ECGs. Cardiac survival was significantly better in the group with a normal ECG at presentation-none of these patients had a cardiac death at follow-up.
There was only a slight excess mortality of the cohort in comparison to the expected survival of a similar U.S. general population (10-year observed vs. expected survival, 69.3% vs. 71.9%; p = 0.04) and 46% of the deaths were attributable to noncardiac causes. However, there was a clear relation between increasing severity of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient and outcome. For patients with high resting gradients (Doppler peak velocity &gt;4 m/s), survival was significantly impaired (53% at 10 years; p = 0.001 vs. expected), and death or severe symptoms occurred in 68% of these patients within 10 years after the initial evaluation. Conversely, there was no impairment of long-term survival for patients with less-severe resting obstruction. Independent predictors of mortality in the entire cohort were age, prior stroke, and LVOT gradient severity.
SICAD and scar were seen in 45 (75%) and 38 (63%) patients, respectively. In 15 patients without SICAD, 12 (80%) had no scar; 23 (70%) patients with mild SICAD had mild scar on CMR. On multivariate analysis, degree of SICAD was independently associated with scar on CMR (Wald chi-square statistic: 6.8, p &lt; 0.01). Patients with basal septal scar on CMR had higher VT frequency compared with those without (27% vs. 5%, p = 0.03).
Ninety-six patients were included. The average age at diagnosis was 10.6 +/- 5.4 years, and mean follow-up was 6.4 +/- 5.2 years. Primary end points occurred in 11 patients over the 20-year follow-up (11%), 4 underwent cardiac transplant and 7 died (3 suddenly). Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy (z-score: &gt;6) and an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise were predictive of non-SCD (p &lt; 0.02 and p &lt; 0.03, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis predicts an 82% survival over a 20-year period.
Mean age was 52.4 years in HCM and 45.3 years in control subjects. The prevalence of myocardial fibrosis in HCM was 70%. PWV was significantly higher in HCM patients compared with control subjects (8.72 +/- 5.83 m/s vs. 3.74 +/- 0.86 m/s, p &lt; 0.0001). PWV was higher (i.e., increased aortic stiffness) in HCM patients with myocardial fibrosis than in those without (9.66 +/- 6.43 m/s vs. 6.51 +/- 3.25 m/s, p = 0.005).
The patients treated with EES were older, presented more frequently with acute myocardial infarction, and had more complicated lesions than the other groups. The EES group demonstrated a higher incidence of all-cause mortality than the SES group and a lower incidence of TVR than the BMS group. Multivariate adjustment demonstrated that BMS was associated with higher TVR and MACE risk than EES (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for TVR: 2.02 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 3.67]; adjusted HR for MACE: 2.15 [95% CI: 1.36 to 3.42]); that SES had a clinical outcome similar to that of EES, and that PES had a higher risk of MACE than did EES (adjusted HR: 1.57 [95% CI: 1.02 to 2.44]).
Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with "small-molecule" drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 years or more. Strict manufacturing regulations and facility upgrades add to these costs. Policy options to increase and stabilize the supply of vaccines include those aimed at increasing supply, such as government subsidies for basic vaccine research, liability protection for manufacturers, and fast-track approval for new vaccines. Options to increase vaccine demand include advance purchase commitments, government stockpiles, and government financing for select populations.
Of the 490 survey instruments sent, 1 was undeliverable, 2 were incomplete, and 206 were completed (42.1% response rate). A total of 104 pharmacies that reported offering immunization services in 2006 were included in the analysis. Compatibility, which was defined as the fit between in-house immunization services and the host pharmacy, was the key to sustainability of immunization services. To enhance compatibility between in-house services and the host pharmacy, two pathways were found. First, in-house services underwent formal evaluations and subsequent modifications were made to the services. The second pathway bypassed the adaptation process. Through the second pathway, an operational champion implemented in-house services in a way that was already compatible with the host pharmacy.
Applying factor analysis to the data yielded a single dimension of patient satisfaction.
Response rate for the survey was 62%. Lifetime prevalence of opioid misuse was 8%, and 5% of students had misused in the past year. Lifetime prevalence of stimulant misuse was 7%, and 5% had misused in the past year. Whites and fraternity or sorority members were more likely than their peers to have ever misused opioids. Past-year opioid misuse was more likely among whites, men, and low academic achievers compared with their peers. Lifetime stimulant misuse was more likely among students who were white, older, and fraternity or sorority members, while past-year misuse was more likely among whites and low academic achievers. Common motives for opioid misuse were to have fun, to relax, and to deal with chronic pain. Stimulants were used to improve concentration and academic performance. Friends were the most common source of prescription opioids and stimulants. Nonmedical prescription use was associated with greater likelihood of alcohol and other illicit substance use.
Participants demonstrated good knowledge of traditional CVD risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of exercise, and overweight or obese status. Knowledge of other CVD risk factors and healthy values for major CVD risk factors was limited. Participants with high CVD risk were significantly more likely to correctly identify high triglycerides as a CVD risk factor and to identify healthy values for fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol compared with participants with low CVD risk.
799 analyzable questionnaires were received. On average, midlevel providers interacted with pharmacists more frequently (median -0.23 and -0.51 for midlevels and physicians, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). The helpfulness of interactions was rated positively by both groups, but the median rating by midlevel providers was higher compared with physicians (0.86 vs. 0.59, P &lt; 0.01). Community pharmacists were rated most favorably on their traditional functions, including patient counseling and reporting drug allergies/interactions. Results were weakly favorable toward expanded functions, such as discussing therapeutic alternatives with patients and dispensing sample medications from pharmacies. Both groups agreed that community pharmacists are valuable sources of information, with midlevel providers indicating a significantly higher level of agreement (1.07 vs. 0.80, P &lt; 0.01).
The average change in test scores was 1.33 and 2.73 in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = 0.11; two-sample t test). The frequency of monthly heartburn episodes increased postsurvey in the control group; however, the frequency of monthly episodes decreased in the intervention group. For the presurvey, no patients reported ever having received GERD education from a pharmacist. For the postsurvey, all 15 patients in the intervention group stated that they had received education from a pharmacist.
452 patients 20 years of age or older were screened. A total of 137 participants (45.2%) had an SBP of 140 mm Hg or more and 73 (24.1%) a DBP of 90 mm Hg or more. Among patients who checked their total cholesterol or HDL, 81 (24.0%) had high total cholesterol and 55 (16.4%) low HDL.
19 states (38%) had specific provisions for disease management, 33 (66%) had provisions for drug therapy management, and 37 (74%) had provisions for collaborative practice. A total of 11 states (22%) specified that pharmacists receive specialized training to participate in such endeavors. Board approval or notification for collaborative practice agreements was required in 16 states (32%).
To substantiate the hemostatic clinical benefit observed by the author, 60 consecutive major thoracic aortic operations in 57 patients in whom PEG sealant was used were retrospectively reviewed. Although comparisons with other agents were not performed for this descriptive report, bleeding results were very favorable for these types of operations. The strong clinical impression is that topical hemostatic application of PEG sealant to anastomotic suture lines is helpful in preventing bleeding.
The multiple drug effect analysis indicated synergy for H460, H520 and H838 cells independent of sequence. As anticipated, paclitaxel-gemcitabine increased the number of G2/M cells, whereas gemcitabine-paclitaxel increased the number of G0/G1 or S cells. Paclitaxel significantly decreased dCK and CDA mRNA levels in H460 and H520 cells (40% to 60%, P &lt; 0.05) and lowered dCK protein (24% to 56%, P &lt; 0.05) without affecting CDA protein. However, paclitaxel increased both dCK (10% to 50%) and CDA (75% to 153%) activity (P &lt; 0.05). Paclitaxel caused substantial declines in the accumulation of the deaminated and phosphorylated metabolites in H520 cells (P &lt; 0.05); the metabolites were not measurable in the remaining two cell lines. The ratio of dCK to CDA mRNA levels corresponded to the combination index (CI) estimated for sequential paclitaxel-gemcitabine.
The Kupffer phase ratio decreased as the HCCs became less differentiated (P&lt;0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis test). The SPIO-intensity index also decreased as HCCs became less differentiated (P&lt;0.0001). A positive correlation was found between the Kupffer phase ratio and the SPIO-MRI index (r=0.839). In the Kupffer phase of Sonazoid-CEUS, all of the moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs appeared hypoechoic and were detected as a perfusion defect, whereas the majority (9 of 13 cases, 69.2%) of the well-differentiated HCCs had an isoechoic pattern. The Kupffer phase images of Sonazoid-CEUS and SPIO-MRI matched perfectly (100%) in all of the moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs.
Enlargement of the pancreas was attenuated in all the PSL-treated patients. Seven of the 21 patients showed pancreatic atrophy, of whom 2 were non-PSL-treated patients. Three patients developed chronic pancreatitis. One patient was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer after 50 months of PSL therapy.
Gd-EOB-DTPA accumulated in the hepatobiliary phase in 6 of the 22 cases. All 6 Gd-EOB-DTPA-positive cases were moderately differentiated HCC, but 11 other moderately differentiated HCCs did not show Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake. Histopathologically, 4 Gd-EOB-DTPA-positive HCCs and 5 Gd-EOB-DTPA-negative HCCs produced bile. HCCs with Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake overexpressed OATP1B3 compared with HCCs without Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake, and OATP1B3 levels were significantly correlated with ERs (r=0.91, P&lt;0.0001).
The newly identified esophageal SCC antigen is encoded by a novel gene located on chromosome 1, here designated CUEC-23. Serum CUEC-23-antibodies (s-CUEC-23-Abs) were detected in 14 of 54 patients with esophageal SCC (26%) by Western blot analysis. Esophageal SCCs were positive for s-CUEC-23-Abs together with CEA, SCC-Ag or CYFRA21-1 in 44, 41 and 52% of cases, respectively. There was no detectable association between the presence of s-CUEC-23-Abs and clinicopathological variables. ELISA showed that the levels of s-CUEC-23-Abs were significantly higher in patients with esophageal SCC than in healthy volunteers (17% in the former using the mean+3 SD of s-CUEC-23-Abs in healthy controls as the cutoff).
Nonalcoholic fatty liver was strongly related to 2-h- and 1-h-post-challenge glucose level (P&lt;0.0001 and P=0.018, respectively), but not fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (P=0.706). The risk factors for IGT were nonalcoholic fatty liver (P&lt;0.05), low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P=0.026) and age (P=0.013). A clearly positive relationship was observed between the difference of BMI and 2-h-post-challenge glucose level among the subjects whose fatty change had improved or worsened (R=0.6, P=0.018).
The age-standardized prevalence of ulcerative colitis in Japan in 2005 was 63.6 per 100,000 persons, and that of Crohn's disease was 21.2. Patient numbers have been steadily increasing with time. The age distribution was found to differ between the two diseases, with Crohn's disease affecting mainly younger people. In both diseases, more than 50% of the patients were male, and over 80% of the patients were classified as mild to moderate in terms of severity.
Adiponectin, C-peptide and BMI levels were significantly lower, and resistin and visfatin levels were significantly higher in the patients on multivariate analysis (P=0.0004, 0.0006, 0.0051, 0.0006 and 0.0013, respectively). In the controls, the inverse correlation between BMI and adiponectin was comparatively strong, but was weak in the patients. The correlation between BMI and leptin was strong in both the controls and the patients. The correlation between BMI and resistin or visfatin was not clear in either the patients or the controls. The correlation between BMI and C-peptide was not clear in the controls, but might be weak in the patients. Leptin, C-peptide and BMI levels gradually decreased with stage progression, and resistin and visfatin levels gradually increased with stage progression (P&lt;0.0001 for all). Comparison between 38 patients with Stage I gastric cancer and the controls showed that adiponectin level tended to decrease in the patients (P=0.0582), and BMI level was not different between two groups (P=0.2480).
HBV genotype was C in 169 patients, B in 16, A in 3, F in 1, and unclassifiable in 5. Among the patients with genotype C, the prevalence of PC wild type was significantly lower in hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)(-) patients than in HBeAg(+) patients (9.5% versus 49.0%, P&lt;0.0001). Among HBeAg(-) patients, the patients with PC wild type had significantly lower serum viral loads and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels compared with those with PC mutant (P&lt;0.001). Among HBeAg(-) patients, the patients with genotype B had lower serum viral loads compared with those with genotype C (3.6+/-0.9 versus 4.6+/-1.6, P&lt;0.05), and the prevalence of BCP wild type was significantly higher in those with genotype B than in those with genotype C (58.3% versus 10.8%, P&lt;0.05).
Significantly lower expression of PAR-1 and higher expression of mast cell tryptase was detected in the colons of patients, with statistically unchanged expression of PAR-2. Thrombin-, TPH-, and ChrA-positive cells were markedly increased in IBS patients, but no significant difference in serotonin concentration existed in the colons between two groups. The ratio of PAR-1/PAR-2 expression was significantly decreased in patients (0.33+/-0.19 versus 0.66+/-0.22, P=0.001) and negatively correlated to ChrA-positive cells.
Diagnostic sensitivity in pancreas, gastric mucosa, liver, bile duct, and duodenal papilla was 47% (7/15), 47% (8/17), 36% (4/11), 0% (0/5), and 57% (4/7), respectively.
Two hundred and twelve gastric ulcer patients (median age 53.3 years) and 306 duodenal ulcer patients (median age 49.7 years) were recruited; 71.8 and 85% of gastric and duodenal ulcer patients, respectively, completed the study. Ulcers were successfully healed in 64.29, 67.14, and 63.89% of gastric ulcer patients and 78.85, 83.65, and 78.57% of duodenal ulcer patients after treatment with 20 mg omeprazole, 5 mg ilaprazole, and 10 mg ilaprazole, respectively. Most patients (&gt;90%) became asymptomatic after treatment. At the dosages administered, both drugs exhibited similar efficacy and a similar safety profile.
A total of 916 liquid reflux episodes were detected, and a total of 171 symptoms were recorded. Eight (4.7%) of 171 symptoms were related to acid reflux, and 68 (39.8%) were related to NAR. Seven (53.8%) patients had a positive SI and in these seven patients, a total of 79 symptoms were recorded. 5 (6.3%) of the 79 symptoms were related to acid reflux and 44 (55.7%) were related to NAR.
PC was excluded in all patients. EUS-FNA resulted in three of eight patients with AIP were reported as p-LPSP, one was reported as normal, and 4 were inconclusive. One of six with non-autoimmune pancreatitis was diagnosed as p-LPSP on EUS-FNA, one as idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) and four were inconclusive. By using EUS-TCB, all AIP patients were diagnosed as LPSP (4 d-LPSP and 4 p-LPSP). Of the six patients with non-autoimmune pancreatitis, three were diagnosed as LPSP (1 d-LPSP and 2 p-LPSP) and three showed ICP on TCB. No complications were identified in any patient with either EUS-FNA or TCB.
Of 44 patients with increased DGER but without increased acid reflux, three had severe reflux esophagitis and seven had Barrett's esophagus. DGER was most frequent under weakly acidic conditions in the intact stomach, esophagectomy, and distal gastrectomy groups. Pure acid reflux and DGER at any pH were elevated in GERD patients with an intact stomach, while weakly acidic and alkaline DGER were elevated in GERD patients after gastrectomy. Esophagectomy patients had reflux with the combined characteristics of those in the intact stomach and gastrectomy groups. Weakly acidic or alkaline DGER was correlated with symptoms and esophageal mucosal changes in gastrectomy patients.
During the 24-month follow-up, the rate of complete resolution of heartburn ranged from 54 to 66%, the rate of discontinuation or reduction of PPI/H2RA use ranged from 65 to 76%, and the rate of endoscopic classification to grade O ranged from 66 to 81%. The status with more than one plication remaining was associated with higher rates of improvement of heartburn, PPI/H2RA use, and endoscopic findings as compared with those associated with the loss of all plications. A modest decrease of the esophageal acid exposure level, but no change of the manometric parameters, was observed after ELGP. No serious adverse events were observed.
The polymorphisms of IL-1beta-511/-31 were significantly associated with peptic ulcer, but other genotypes were not. Serum pepsinogen I and II levels and I/II ratio were significantly higher in the ulcer group than in the non-ulcer group. Taking PPI [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.39], pepsinogen I of less than 50 ng/ml (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.56) and IL-1beta-511 T carrier (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-0.93) were significantly associated with peptic ulcer.
Significant risk was observed in the presence of PTGS2 -1195GA (P=0.006; odds ratio=2.00; 95% confidence interval=1.2-3.3) and AA genotypes (P=0.050; odds ratio=2.98; 95% confidence interval=1.0-8.9). Combined risk due to GA+AA genotypes was 2.12 (P=0.002; 95% confidence interval=1.3-3.3; P-trend=0.001). Sub-grouping showed a risk due to the PTGS2 -1195(GA+AA) genotype in males (P=0.007; odds ratio=2.97; 95% confidence interval=1.3-6.5), patients without gallstones (P=0.001; odds ratio=2.53; 95% confidence interval=1.4-4.7) and with late-onset gallbladder cancer (P=0.012; odds ratio=1.99; 95% confidence interval=1.1-3.4). Gallbladder cancer patients who used tobacco were at increased risk in the presence of the PTGS2 -765GC genotype (P=0.018; odds ratio=2.96; 95% confidence interval=1.2-7.2).
Of 150 patients enrolled, H. pylori status was negative in 122 cases and positive in 28 cases, assessed by the 13C-UBT. On the other hand, the monoclonal stool antigen test results were negative in 126 cases and positive in 24. The polyclonal stool test results were negative in 126 cases and positive in 22. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the monoclonal stool antigen test were 91.6% (95% CI 85.9-97.3%) and 98.4% (95% CI 97.3-99.5%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the polyclonal stool antigen test were 87.0% (95% CI 86.9-94.0%) and 97.5% (95% CI 96.1-98.9%).
The characteristics of the 104 patients evaluated for efficacy were well balanced. The clinical response rates were 100.0% (50/50 patients) in the CIP group and 94.4% (51/54) in the IPM/CS group. The difference in clinical response rate between groups (CIP, IPM/CS) was 5.56% (90% confidence interval: -0.26%, 13.95%), and the non-inferiority of CIP to IPM/CS was confirmed. Adverse events for which causal relationships with the study drugs could not be ruled out developed in 5.4% (3/56) of patients in the CIP group and 5.2% (3/58) of patients in the IPM/CS group, and none of them were serious.
A positive HR-HPV test result which was performed between 3 and 6 months after procedure was a risk factor for persistent or recurrent cytological (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio [OR]=22.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]=9.74-52.02) and pathological (p&lt;0.001, OR=18.28, 95% CI=5.55-60.20) abnormalities.
High-risk HPV was detected in 73 of 77 (94.8%) patients before conization. At the 6-months follow-up, the high-risk HPV was eliminated in 60 of 73 (82.2%) patients. The HPV persistence rate after conization was 17.8% (13/73). Univariate analysis showed that persistent HPV infection after conization with negative margins was more likely to occur when the pretreatment viral load was high (RLU/positive control &gt;100 (p=0.027) and the HPV was type 16 (p=0.021). Logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative HPV type 16 infection was the only significant independent factor (p=0.021) for HPV persistence out of age, cytology, punch biopsy histology, HPV viral load, and conization histology.
There was no significant difference in overall response rate between EDRA group and the control group (84.5% vs. 71.8%, p=0.107). However, 93.8% of patients in EDRA group did not show EDR to at least one drug and its response rate was significantly higher than that of the control group (93.3% vs. 71.8%, p=0.023).
In total, 54 patients met the inclusion criteria. Optimal cytoreduction to &lt;0.5 cm residual disease was achieved in 87% of patients who had received secondary cytoreductive surgery. Univariate analysis revealed that site of recurrence (median survival, 53 months for the largest tumors in the pelvis vs. 24 months for the largest tumors except for the pelvis; p=0.007), progression free survival (PFS) (median survival, 43 months for PFS&gt;/=12 months vs. 24 months for PFS&lt;12 months; p=0.036), and number of recurrence sites (median survival, 49 months for single recurred tumor vs 29 months for multiple recurred tumors; p=0.036) were significantly associated with overall survival. On multivariate analysis, prognostic factors that correlated with improved survival were site of recurrence (p=0.013), and PFS (p=0.043).
Completed questionnaires were returned by 64.1% (84/131) of the oncologists at 50 institutes. Extrafascial hysterectomy (EH) was used by 32% of respondents and modified radical hysterectomy (MRH) or radical hysterectomy (RH) by 17%. Hysterectomy procedures were selectively employed based on tumor-related factors by 51% of the respondents. Laparoscopic hysterectomy was routinely utilized by 49% and was more commonly used by younger surgeons with 10 years of experience or less. PEN dissection was routinely utilized by 67% and was used selectively based on tumor-related factors by 33%. PAN dissection/biopsy was used either routinely (43%) or selectively based on tumor-related factors (43%). PAN dissection/biopsy had never been employed by 12% of the respondents. Sixty-nine percent of respondents stated that grossly normal looking ovaries can be preserved during surgery in young aged patients with early stage disease, and 29% stated that bilateral oophorectomy should be performed irrespective of age or stage. Omentectomy was routinely performed by 11% of respondents, and was selectively performed when extrauterine spread was present by 41%.
Cisplatin inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death in HeLa cells; however, carboplatin enhanced TRAIL-induced cell death. Whereas cisplatin inhibited caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage, carboplatin had no effect on caspase-8 activity.
Abnormal overexpression of TGF-beta1 and abnormal reduction of type II TGF-beta1 receptor were identified in 36% (18 of 50) and 20% (10 of 50) of cervical cancer tissues, respectively. 22% (11 of 50) in Smad2 and 14% (7 of 50) in Smad4 revealed tumor specific mRNA reduction less than a half of normal means. In addition, no evidence for sequence alterations of the gene was found by RT-PCR-SSCP analysis.
LPS or IFN alone did not induce COX-2. However, treatment with 10 mug LPS plus 20 ng IFN per ml induced COX-2 protein 10-fold in Control shRNA MAEC. Induction was significantly greater (47-fold) in PIN1 shRNA cells. COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 production increased 3-fold in KD MAEC, but did not increase in Control cells. The additional increase in COX-2 protein due to PIN1 depletion was post-transcriptional, as induction of COX-2 mRNA by LPS/IFN was the same in cells containing or lacking PIN1. Instead, the loss of COX-2 protein, after treatment with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, was reduced in cells lacking PIN1 in comparison with Control cells, indicating that degradation of the enzyme was reduced. zVF and PD150606 each enhanced the induction of COX-2 by LPS/IFN. zVF also slowed the loss of COX-2 after treatment with cycloheximide, and COX-2 was degraded by exogenous mu-calpain in vitro. In contrast to iNOS, physical interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 was not detected, suggesting that effects of PIN1 on calpain, rather than COX-2 itself, affect COX-2 degradation. While cathepsin activity was unaltered, depletion of PIN1 reduced calpain activity by 55% in comparison with Control shRNA cells.
Ninety HIV-1-infected children initiated HAART, and were followed for a median of 15 months (interquartile range: 2-21). Mean CD4 percentage was 17.2% in the diary arm versus 16.3% in the control arm at six months (p = 0.92), and 17.6% versus 18.9% at 15 months (p = 0.36). Virologic response with HIV-1 RNA of &lt;100 copies/ml at nine months was similar between the two arms (50% for the diary arm and 36% for the control, p = 0.83). The weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height at three, nine and 15 months after HAART initiation were similar between arms. A trend towards lower self-reported adherence was observed in the diary versus the control arm (85% versus 92%, p = 0.08).
No significant differences in primary outcomes were revealed between Lokomat and manual groups as a result of training. However, within the Lokomat group, self-selected walk speed, paretic step length ratio, and four of the six secondary measures improved (p = 0.04-0.05, effect sizes = 0.19-0.60). Within the manual group, only balance scores improved (p = 0.02, effect size = 0.57). Group differences between fast and slow training groups were not revealed (p &gt; or = 0.28).
The 419 patients had a mean age of 71.5 +/- 11.7 years and most (70.6%) underwent pharmacologic stress. In follow-up, 35 (8.4%) patients suffered an adverse cardiac event. Patients with AC-SSS 1-3 and AC-SSS 4-8 had similar cardiac event rates (11.4% vs 10.5%, P = NS). Accordingly, AC-SSS cutoffs of 0, 1-8, and &gt;8 were selected to classify perfusion as normal, mildly abnormal, and moderately to severely abnormal with annualized event rates of 2.1%, 10.8%, and 18.7%, respectively (P &lt; .001). In multivariable analysis, AC-SSS &gt;8 was the most powerful predictor of cardiac events followed by AC-SSS 1-8, history of CAD, age &gt;75 and pharmacologic stress.
Subcellular distribution of Tc-99m-N-MPO and Tc-99m-sestamibi was examined in the excised Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat myocardium. Biodistribution and planar imaging studies were performed using SD rats in the absence/presence of Cyclosporin-A. Due to negative plasma and mitochondrial potentials, 84.5% +/- 3.2% of Tc-99m-N-MPO was found in the mitochondrial fraction as compared to 88.0% +/- 1.5% of Tc-99m-sestamibi. There was no significant difference in their mitochondrial accumulation. Tc-99m-N-MPO was also able to retain its chemical integrity in rat myocardium. Pre-treatment of SD rats with Cys-A result in significant increase in the kidney and liver uptake of Tc-99m-N-MPO.
Agreement on the presence or absence of ischemia between adenosine SPECT MPI and DSE was 69% (kappa = .25, P = NS). Agreement on the presence or absence of ischemia between adenosine and dobutamine SPECT MPI was 77% (kappa = .37, P = &lt;.009). Summed stress scores for adenosine and dobutamine SPECT MPI studies were highly correlated (r = .9, P = &lt;.0001). DSE and SPECT MPI results provided incremental prognostic information when added to clinical variables.
A 3-cardiologist Cardiac Event Prediction Panel (CEPP) estimated three-year cardiac event (non-fatal MI; aborted sudden cardiac death; cardiac death) risk based on clinical data (C) for 371 subjects. CEPP repeated this estimation after receiving Summed Stress Scores (SSS) and Summed Rest Scores (SRS) from blinded reading of rest-stress (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin MPI SPECT studies (C + MPI). The C and C + MPI estimates were then compared with three-year and total event rates. MPI was normal (SSS &lt;/= 3) in 227 patients (61%), mildly abnormal (SSS 4-8) in 31 (8%), moderately abnormal (SSS 9-13) in 36 (10%), and severely abnormal (SSS &gt; 13) in 77 (21%). Eighteen cardiac events occurred within 3 years and 33 occurred during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years. C + MPI estimates of low risk (&lt;1-1.5%/year) identified significantly more patients who did not have events than C. C + MPI three-year event-rate predictions were more accurate than those made with C (P &lt; .01). C + MPI categorization also provided better delineation of incremental risk on time-to-event analyses.
The nuclear cardiology database was used to identify 260 asymptomatic patients (67 +/- 8 years, 72% men) without known CAD who were at moderate CAD risk according to the Framingham risk score. SPECT MPI images were categorized using the summed stress score (SSS). Mean follow-up 9.9 +/- 3.0 years. Abnormal SPECT MPI scans were present in 142 patients (55%). By SSS categories, SPECT scans were low-risk in 67%, intermediate-risk in 20%, and high-risk in 13% of patients. Overall survival at 10 years was 79%, significantly better than the age- and gender-matched Minnesota general population (P &lt; 0.001). Survival was 60% for patients with high-risk scans (95% CI 45-80%), 79% with intermediate-risk scans (95% CI 69-91%), and 83% with low-risk scans (95% CI 77-88%) (P = 0.03), including 84% (95% CI 77-91%) with normal scans.
We studied 386 patients referred for MPS with either recent coronary angiography or a low pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease. All rest and stress images were obtained exclusively in the prone position. The sensitivity of prone-only MPS was 88% for detecting &gt; or =50% coronary artery stenosis and 92% for detecting &gt; or =70% coronary artery stenosis as determined by coronary angiography. Normalcy rate for prone-only MPS in patients with low probability for CAD was 95%, and normalcy rates did not significantly differ among coronary artery distributions.
Sixteen dogs were studied after an overnight fast (FAST), during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (CLAMP), or during infusion of intralipid (IL) or IL plus dobutamine (IL/DOB). MFAE was quantified using [1-(11)C]palmitate and PET and compared to the rate of triglyceride (TG) synthesis measured using [1-(13)C]palmitate and tissue sampling. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration varied approximately 20-fold across groups, with this variation in FFA availability accompanied by a approximately 20-fold range in TG synthesis. MFAE varied approximately 12-fold across groups, and was significantly correlated with TG synthesis (R = 0.80, P &lt; .001). MFAE, however, was 3- to 4-fold higher than TG synthesis in FAST, CLAMP, and IL, but only approximately 50% higher when cardiac work was increased in IL/DOB, suggesting that MFAE reflects, in part, the incorporation of label into amino acids via TCA cycle exchange reactions.
This prospective study tested the value of rest and low-dose dobutamine (LDD) Tc-99m-mibi gated-SPECT for early prediction of LV remodeling in patients treated by PCI in the acute phase of a first MI. Infarct size, infarct severity, regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA), and wall thickening score (WTs) were assessed at rest and on LDD by SPECT 6 +/- 2 days after MI in 40 patients. LV remodeling was defined as 20% increase at 6 months in LV end-diastolic volume assessed by MRI. Infarct severity at rest showed the best predictive values for left remodeling (PPV: 86%, NPV: 88%, accuracy: 88%; AUC: 0.750). Functional parameters at neither rest nor LDD study further improved predictive values of the SPECT imaging.
Twenty-one patients (mean age 65 +/- 10 years) with reversible myocardial perfusion defects on (201)TI-SPECT images during dipyridamole-stimulated hyperemia were recruited for study purpose. Within 5 days of the (201)TI-SPECT study, myocardial perfusion was studied again with MRI during dipyridamole stimulation and at rest. Overall, (201)TI-SPECT identified 30 reversible regional perfusion defects. The sensitivity to detect hypoperfused segments was 70% (21/30) with the GRE-MRI perfusion analysis with (201)TI-SPECT as reference. When patients were subgrouped according to the extent of regional reversible perfusion defects on (201)TI-SPECT, mild- (SDS: 2-4), moderate- (SDS: 5-8), and severe- (SDS &gt; 8) perfusion defects were also identified by GRE-MRI perfusion analysis in 75% (6/8), in 56% (9/16) and 100% (6/6), respectively.
For 204 patient studies from multiple clinical sites, the first reader identified (1) 69 studies with medium to large axial motion, of which STASYS perfectly or significantly corrected 86.9% and MoCo 72.5%; and (2) 20 studies with medium to large lateral motion, of which STASYS perfectly or significantly corrected 80.0% and MoCo 60.0%. The second reader identified (1) 84 studies with medium to large axial motion, of which STASYS perfectly or significantly corrected 82.2% and MoCo 76.2%; and (2) 34 studies with medium to large lateral motion, of which STASYS perfectly or significantly corrected 58.9% and MoCo 50.0%.
To develop the conversion algorithm, 150 consecutive SPECT studies (82 abnormal) were read by both a 12-segment and the standard 17-segment models. Summed stress scores (SSSs) were calculated from a 17-segment model derived from the 12-segment data and compared to those of the standard 17-segment model. The effect of the conversion algorithm on prognostic data derived from the 12-segment model was evaluated in 25,876 patients from the Duke Nuclear Cardiology Database, including a sample of 3,205 patients with known covariates for adjusted analysis. The derived 17-segment SSS from the 12-segment model was highly correlated (R = 0.99) to the SSS from the standard 17-segment model. In both unadjusted and adjusted analysis, there was no difference in the prognostic information.
This was a prospective study of 1,020 consecutive patients who were referred for stress MPI (429 patients) or stress Echo (591 patients) at the American University of Beirut Medical Center in the year of 2008. Patients referred to MPI were older and had a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and previous myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, or bypass surgery. There were more abnormal scans in the stress MPI group (24% vs 15%, P &lt; 0.001), as well as a higher prevalence of ischemia (15% vs 7.6%, P &lt; 0.001) and impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction &lt;50% (11% vs 1.7%, P &lt; 0.001). A higher percentage of stress Echo studies were self-referred by physicians who themselves interpret the scans (31% vs 19%, P &lt; 0.001).
In the MERIDIAN trial, patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, stable, mild anginal symptoms (Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification (CCS) I-II/IV) and reversible perfusion defects were randomized to either continued pharmacological treatment or early invasive treatment. In this sub analysis, the severity of the myocardial perfusion defect was related to the occurrence of cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction, in 319 patients (63% male, 65 +/- 9 years). During follow-up (2.2 +/- 0.6 years), 14 patients had a cardiac event: 3 in 171 patients without myocardial ischemia and 11 in 148 patients with myocardial ischemia. Annual event rates rose from 0.8% to 5.8% with increasing severity of myocardial ischemia. Multivariable analysis identified the presence of severe myocardial ischemia (hazard ratio (HR) 5.45, 95%CI 1.89-15.71) and insulin use (HR 4.00, 95%CI 1.25-12.75) as independent predictors of cardiac events.
A modified study model was supported in this sample of acute care nurses (R = 0.258, P = .000) and explained 26% of nurses' reported expertise.
Statistically significant increases in direct (3 months) and indirect nursing care (3 and 9 months) were found, with variability between sites. Statistically significant increases at 3 and 9 months for documentation of patient care activities and decreases in administrative activities were the most consistent findings for all sites.
Among MMC participants, change scores (from baseline to postintervention) on several subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised showed significantly more improvement in self-reported stress symptoms relative to controls. Mindfulness meditation course participants had significantly more improvement in Positive Symptom Distress Index (P = 0.010; confidence interval [CI] = -0.483 to -0.073) and Global Severity Index (P = 0.019; CI = -0.475 to -0.046) and nearly significantly more improvement in Positive Symptom Total (P = 0.066; CI = -16.66 to 0.581) compared with controls.
Before delegating, nurses reported considering patient condition, competency, experience, and workload of unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP). Nurses expected UAP to report significant findings and have higher level knowledge, including assessment and prioritizing skills. Successful delegation was dependent on the relationship between the RN and the UAP, communication, system support, and nursing leadership. Nurses reported frequent instances of missed or omitted routine care.
Results of the experiment indicate that exercise significantly increased osteogenesis on the periosteal and endocortical surface of the mice in the older age group (P &lt; 0.05). Exercise had no significant effect on bone formation of mice in the younger age group, although exercised mice exhibited more bone growth on average than controls. Endocortical apposition was the primary method of bone formation for all mice in the experiment; however exercised mice in the older age group were able to add more bone on the periosteal surface than age-matched controls and exercised mice in the younger age group (P &lt; 0.05). Medullary area increased with age, but exercised mice in both age groups had smaller medullary cavities relative to overall bone area than controls.
We demonstrate that murine Muc16 is expressed by mouse ovarian cancer cells as an ~250 kDa glycoprotein that carries both O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast to human MUC16, the murine ortholog is primarily released from the cells and cannot be detected on the cell surface. Since the released murine Muc16 is not detected by conventional anti-CA125 assays, we have for the first time identified a panel of anti-human MUC16 antibodies that also recognizes the murine counterpart.
Berberine has multiple neuropharmacological properties, such as neuroprection, anti-neuronal apoptosis, improvement of cerebral microcirculation and anti-Alzheimer's disease, and so on. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of berberine are that it is not easily absorbed and it is not stable in the gastrointestinal tract of animals or humans.
This review critically discusses the pharmacology of CB receptor activation as a novel therapeutic anticancer strategy in terms of ligand selectivity, tissue specificity and potency. Intriguingly, antitumour effects mediated by cannabinoids are not confined to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation; cannabinoids also reduce angiogenesis, cell migration and metastasis, inhibit carcinogenesis and attenuate inflammatory processes. In the last decade several new selective CB(1) and CB(2) receptor agents have been described, but most studies in the area of cancer research have used non-selective CB ligands. Moreover, many of these ligands exert prominent CB receptor-independent pharmacological effects, such as activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and the transient receptor potential vanilloid channels.
Using a w/o microemulsion as a vehicle, intradermal delivery of quercetin was significantly increased, as was its solubility. Quercetin penetrated deep into the skin, but no transfer was observed into the receptor compartment. It was confirmed that quercetin retained in the skin dose-dependently inhibited lipid peroxidation.
Our results indicated that Kollidon SR matrices and the three-layer composite systems with and without effervescing components were not significantly affected by the dissolution conditions. However, in the case of the floating monolithic systems based on hypromellose and polyethylene oxide, both release profiles and swelling dynamics in accordance with the similarity factor (f(2)) and symmetrical shape factor values were significantly influenced.
After HPLC purification through a Superdex-200 gel column, another peak with a molecular mass of 250 KDa was observed before Fab and SEA were eluted. Indirect immunocytochemical analysis and immunofluorescence tests showed that the cell membranes of most human bladder cancer cells were positively stained only by the conjugate, confirming the ability of the conjugate to target human bladder carcinoma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation and cytokine release were similar with the conjugate and SEA. Cytotoxicity targeting in MHC II-negative bladder cancer cell lines, evaluated by flow cytometry, showed significant differences between the conjugate and SEA, whereas there was no difference in the Lovo colon cancer cell line.
All piperazine analogues tested showed significant inhibitory activity against most, if not all, isoenzymes tested. The metabolism of benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) involved CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Furthermore, BZP and TFMPP inhibited each other's metabolism.
The apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) for atenolol (mainly paracellular transport) and propranolol (transcellular transport) amounted to 0.1 +/- 0.1 and 23.7 +/- 0.6 x 10(-6) cm/s, respectively, illustrating that the system can be used to discriminate between high permeability and low permeability compounds. Transport of talinolol (substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux carrier) did not reveal polarity (0.3 +/- 0.2 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 x 10(-6) cm/s for absorptive and secretory transport, respectively) and was not affected by verapamil (10 muM), suggesting the absence of P-glycoprotein in the nasal cell culture. No significant effects of atenolol, propranolol and talinolol on ciliary beat frequency were observed (98 +/- 20% of the control condition after 60 min). Chlorocresol significantly decreased the ciliary activity but this decrease was not accompanied by effects on the transepithelial transport of atenolol, propranolol and talinolol.
The inter-individual variability in effective surface area was the largest contributor to absorption variability. Based on in-vitro dissolution profiles, the mean plasma cimetidine concentration-time profiles as well as the inter-individual variability could be well described for three cimetidine formulations. In the case of the formulation with the slowest dissolution kinetic, model predictions on the basis of the in-vitro dissolution profile underestimated the plasma exposure.
Morphine but not fentanyl or naloxone provoked dose-dependent displacement of [(125)I]paraiodoclonidine from all alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes in the brain regions analysed. Binding affinity was highest in cortex, medulla oblongata and pons of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor knockout mice.
In transport studies using everted intestine, the mucosal methotrexate influx rate in proximal intestine at pH 5.5 was significantly greater than that at pH 7.4. Coadministration of folate or its analogues, such as folinate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, substrates for both PCFT/HCP1 and RFC1, significantly suppressed the methotrexate influx at pH 5.5, whereas thiamine pyrophosphate, an inhibitor for RFC1 alone, exerted no significant effect. Western blot analysis showed higher PCFT/HCP1 expression in proximal than distal small intestine. In distal small intestine, methotrexate influx rate was low and was not pH dependent. Also, folate and its analogues exerted no significant effect on methotrexate absorption.
All compounds had prominent antioxidative activity, comparable to that of the synthetic vitamin E derivate Trolox. Hexaprenylhydroquinone showed the greatest cytotoxicity in H4IIE hepatoma cells (EC50 2.5 muM). All three compounds inhibited NF-kappaB signalling in this cell line, with heptaprenylhydroquinone being the most active. Screening of 23 kinases involved in signal transduction pathways (cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis) showed that hexaprenylhydroquinone and heptaprenylhydroquinone inhibited the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (IC50 1.6 and 1.4 mug/ml, respectively), and heptaprenylhydroquinone also inhibited the activity of other kinases (Src tyrosine kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor).
The decrease in partial oxygen pressure of arterial blood (Pao(2)) and the increase in airway vascular permeability induced by the oleic acid injection were attenuated by a single dose of TJ-19. When TJ-19 was administered orally twice a day for two weeks and then oleic acid was injected, a potent prophylactic effect of the drug was observed. TJ-19 also prevented airway vascular hyperpermeability, lung cell injury, oxidative stress and thromboxane A(2) generation, associated with the oleic acid injection.
Behavioural parameters encompassed by the pentylenetetrazole test indicated that 80% ethanolic extracts of LP1, LP3 and LP6 L. alba chemotypes were more effective as anticonvulsant agents. Neurochemical assays using synaptosomes and synaptic membranes showed that L. alba LP3 chemotype 80% ethanolic extract inhibited GABA uptake and GABA binding in a dose-dependent manner. HPLC analysis showed that LP1, LP3 and LP6 80% ethanolic extracts presented a similar profile of constituents, differing from those seen in LP2, LP4, LP5 and LP7 80% ethanolic extracts, which exhibited no anticonvulsant effect. GC-MS analysis indicated the occurrence of phenylpropanoids in methanolic fractions obtained from LP1, LP3 and LP6 80% ethanolic extracts and also the accumulation of inositol and flavonoids in hydroalcoholic fractions.
Centella asiatica extract significantly reduced radiation-induced damage to DNA. The extent of radiation-induced mortality and lipid peroxidation was also found to be considerably reduced in animals administered with the extract.
The results indicated that the relaxing effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride on isolated gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction induced by acetylcholine was stronger than that of atropine (based on PA2 values). In the radioimmune assay, penehyclidine hydrochloride increased the cAMP content in isolated guinea-pig stomach smooth muscle and decreased the cAMP content in isolated guinea-pig intestinal smooth muscle, but the difference was not statistically significant at a dose of 10 mumol/l.
It was found that sodium cholate and sodium 12-monoketocholate decreased the AP-BL permeation of methotrexate at low concentrations (maximal inhibition at 0.25 and 1 mM, respectively) and increased it at higher concentrations. Determination of [(14)C] mannitol permeation and electrical resistance of monolayers during experiments showed that membrane integrity was not compromised at low concentrations of bile salts but was disrupted at higher concentrations. Subsequently, we examined the effect of the simultaneous oral administration of sodium 12-monoketocholate (4, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) on the intestinal absorption of methotrexate in rats after an oral dose (5 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetic study showed that 12-monoketocholate at 4 and 20 mg/kg did not change the methotrexate area under the serum concentration-time curve whereas sodium 12-monoketocholate at 40 and 80 mg/kg significantly reduced it.
Clove essential oil increased the total white blood cell (WBC) count and enhanced the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice. Moreover, it restored cellular and humoral immune responses in cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice in a dose-dependent manner. Ginger essential oil recovered the humoral immune response in immunosuppressed mice. Contrary to the ginger essential oil response, sage essential oil did not show any immunomodulatory activity.
We did not find sifferences between glycaemia at baseline and after OGTT between patients with VTE carriers of FVL compared to non-carriers of FVL. We found a relevant increase in the prevalence of IGT and diabetes between patients with VTE carriers of FVL compared to non-carriers of FVL although this increase did not raise statistical significance.
Proposed solutions included ways to add to the dwindling surgical workforce, to more efficiently handle the rising public demand for emergency surgical services, to attempt to increase federal reimbursements and other payments for emergency surgical care, and to overcome limitations of existing laws on emergency care.
Average age, male to female ratio, and injury severe score were comparable for both cohorts (p &gt; 0.6). Average follow-up was 16 months versus 12 months for the operative and nonoperative groups, respectively, (p = 0.11). In the operative group, 8 of 9 (89%) patients were extubated within 24 hours of surgery; 3 of 9 (33%) were extubated in the operating room. In the operative group, seven patients underwent internal fixation of the clavicle and progressed to union with a mean Constant score of 93. Nine patients had nonoperative treatment of the clavicle with a mean Constant score of 75 (p = 0.04). Total intubation time (1.9 days) was significantly shorter in the operative group than the nonoperative controls at 13.3 days (p &lt; 0.01) and length of ICU stay was also shortened at 5.7 (4-8) days versus 16.7 (10-26) days, respectively, (p &lt; 0.01).
Injury + LPS showed immune priming observed by lung injury histology and increased bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia, lung myeloperoxidase and serum IL-6, CXCL1, and MIP-2 levels when compared with injury + vehicle or LPS alone. After injury, resuscitation with HTS, but not Lactated Ringer's was more effective in attenuating the primed response to a second hit.
Three hundred thirty-three children, mean age 11 years, had chest CTs, increasing from 5.5% in 2001-2002 to 10.5% in 2004-2005 (p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, in those children who underwent chest CT, the rate of initial CXR use decreased from 84% to 56% during the same period (p &lt; 0.001). Twenty percent of chest CTs had significant positive findings. Six patients underwent emergency surgery for cardiac or arterial injuries, and all demonstrated abnormal findings on CXR or CT scout imaging. When compared with the CT, only 5% of initial CXRs falsely reported normal findings that may have altered management.
Baseline characteristics such were not significantly different between groups. The baseline AUC did not differ between groups. The old blood group demonstrated a significant decline in Sto2 comparing its baseline period to its transfusion period (p &lt; 0.05). There was no similar decline in the control group or the new blood group. The posttransfusion period AUC for the old blood group was also lower versus baseline (p = 0.06). There was a moderate correlation between increasing age of blood and decrease in oxygenation (r = 0.5).
Four hundred thirty-five patients underwent emergency operations postinjury and received FFP with &gt;10 units of PRBC in the operating room; 135 (31.0%) of these patients had TIC and 53 died (39.5% mortality). Mean operative time was 137 minutes (SD +/- 49). There were no differences with regard to age, gender, mechanism of injury, initial base deficit, or Injury Severity Score among all groups. A significant difference in mortality was found in patients who received &gt;10 units of PRBC when FFP:PRBC ratio was 1:1 versus 1:4 (28.2% vs. 51.1%, p = 0.03). Intermediate mortality rates were noted in patients with 1:2 and 1:3 ratios (38% and 40%, respectively). From a linear regression model, 13 days of increased TICU LOS was observed among 1:4 group compared with 1:1 group (p &lt; 0.01).
Peak deceleration imposed on the trunks was up to 60 g, which caused peak deceleration up to 26 g in the liver. No anatomic injury was observed. For each orientation, deceleration ratios were not significantly different among the three sites (p = 0.64) or between left and right lateral decelerations (p = 0.12). Deceleration ratios were significantly different (p = 0.001) between frontal (3 sites combined) and lateral (3 sites of left and right lateral orientations combined) decelerations: 39.4% (+/-6) versus 48.4% (+/-11).
Over a 2-year period, 94 study patients underwent RSI, of which 35 received etomidate (37%). There were no significant differences in demographic, physiology, anatomic injury scores, or use of hypertonic saline resuscitation between the groups. After adjusting for physiology, injury severity, and transfusion, etomidate use remained associated with ARDS (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI =1.24-12.0).
There was no change in the regional blood flows in 8 of 9 organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, small intestines, large intestines, and skeletal muscle) after HBOC-201 compared with controls; only skeletal muscle blood flow decreased. In contrast, with HSA, blood flow increased 150% to 200% of baseline in all organs except muscle where blood flow was unchanged. HBOC-201 effectively restored oxygen delivery after these exchanges. The mean arterial pressure increases in the HBOC-201 group were within 15% to 20% of baseline during the initial 10% exchange and similar to controls during subsequent exchanges. Although peak pulmonary arterial pressure increases in the HBOC-201 group were 10 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg above baseline, cardiac index was unchanged. There were no differences in global oxygen consumption, consistent with unchanged regional blood flow and suggests intact physiologic coupling of oxygen delivery and consumption that was unimpaired by local vasoconstriction. This is in contrast to significant changes of increased cardiac index, decreased arterial pressure, decreased oxygen content, and increased oxygen extraction ratio to maintain normal oxygen consumption in the HSA group.
MILS did not significantly affect maximal motion of this model in any of the three measures using either DL or BL. There were no clinically significant differences in maximal median motion in any of the three measures when comparing the two blades. However, there was significantly more variance in the subluxation caused by DL than by BL.
Twenty-two (26.2%) patients died in hospital. Car crash (39%) and falls (37.85) were the most frequent causes of trauma. The causes of death were as follows: neurologic, 8 (36.4%); respiratory, 4 (18.2%); septic complications, 2 (9.1%); venous thrombosis and embolism, 2 (9.1%); and undetermined, 4 (18.2%). Bivariate analysis identified absent neurologic function (risk ratios [RR] = 4.5; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.6-12.7), high injury severity score (p = 0.001) and low revised trauma score (p = 0.001); Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score &lt;9 (RR = 47.4; 95% CI, 5.4-413.2); shock at admission (RR = 2.5; 95% CI, 0.8-7.9); vasopressor use (RR = 25.8; 95% CI, 6.1-109.6); mechanical ventilation (RR = 31.9; 95% CI, 6.6-154.0); acute renal insufficiency (RR = 10.0; 95% CI, 0.98-102.1) as associated with mortality. The mainly independents predictors for mortality were GCS score &lt;9 and vasopressor use. Lowest mortality rate (5.2%) was observed for patients with TSCI alone.
Six hundred nine patients were reviewed, and 248 were administered the OT HIMS. Eighty-three suffered some impairment. The mean GCS for the 248 patients was 13.96 (+/-2.16). A coefficient of correlation between GCS and GOAT score of only 0.224 and an R2 value of 0.050 indicated no correlation between these results. Comparing GCS and the presence of impairment identified by Cognistat yielded an R2 value of 0.093, indicating no correlation between these parameters. Among the patients whose results showed cognitive deficits on OT HIMS, 38% had impairments before injury. Interestingly, only 58% of patients with deficits before injury also demonstrated impairments on OT HIMS. Of the 248 patients, 12 went to rehabilitation centers and this was not correlated with GCS.
We identified 357 patients with TBI from five categories: whites (46.2%), Asians (19.9%), Hispanics (17.9%), blacks (10.9%), and other\unknown (5.0%). Without adjusting for other factors, Asians experienced higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 2.25, p = 0.01) compared with whites but not degree of disability. After adjusting for age and Injury Severity Score, a weaker trend remained for higher mortality in Asians (OR = 1.38, p = 0.35), and after excluding cases of assault, the finding was again significant (OR = 2.00, p = 0.04). We also confirmed the recently reported OR of higher mortality among blacks (OR = 1.30). Hispanics seemed to do slightly better at discharge.
Seven hundred eighty-six patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study with an overall mortality of 5.8% (46 patients). When entered into our predictive model, the percentage of correct classification rate was 92% compared with the 94% rate seen in the original study, which is better than other available predictive tools based on combined scoring systems such as the Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology.
Eighty-four percent (n = 631) of the patients were men. The mean age was 34.8 (+/-16.3) years and the mortality was 33.3%. After the multiple logistic regression, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death was higher in older (&gt; 60 years) than younger (up to 30 years) patients (OR = 2.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-4.79, p = 0.006). The mortality was also associated with sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.23-2.81, p = 0.003) on computed tomography (CT) scan; admission Glasgow Scale of 3 or 4 in comparison to 7 or 8 (OR = 3.97, 95% CI = 2.49- 6.31, p &lt; 0.001); bilateral midryasis (OR = 11.52, 95% CI = 5.56-23.87, p &lt; 0.0001), or anisocoria (OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.69-4.17, p &lt; 0.0001) in comparison to isocoric pupils. There was a trend for higher mortality in patients with type III injury on the Marshall classification of CT (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 0.84-15.76, p = 0.08) than in patients with normal CT. Patients without thoracic trauma disclose higher mortality than patients with associated thoracic trauma do (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.19-3.41, p = 0.009). The final model presented disclosed 76.9% of overall correct prediction with the survival and death predicted at 87.6% and 55.6%, respectively.
A total of 55 patients met the criteria of recurrent VAP. Of these 55 recurrences, 19 (35%) were relapses. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, injury severity score, and GCS were not associated with VAP relapse by univariate analyses. Patients who relapsed had primary VAP involving nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas species) more frequently than other organisms (68% vs. 32%, p = 0.001). Primary VAP with NFGNB was found to be a significant predictor of VAP relapse by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR = 5.1, p = 0.003; OR = 4.63, p = 0.005, respectively).
A total of 1,615 patients met study criteria. Adjusted RR (CI) for the association between pneumonia and receipt of blood at any time was 1.99 (1.39-2.86). However, when postpneumonia transfusions were disregarded, no association was observed (RR 1.33; CI 0.98-1.80). Analysis by blood age, however, demonstrated that prepneumonia transfusion of exclusively older blood was significantly associated with an increased risk of pneumoinia (adjusted RR 1.42; CI 1.01-2.02), whereas transfusion of exclusively younger units (adjusted RR 1.02; CI 0.62-1.67) or mixed units (adjusted RR 1.35; CI 0.98-1.87) were not.
Admission MRSA screening was positive in 71 patients, yielding a carrier prevalence rate of 5.8% (95% CI 4.5-7.1%). No admission characteristic was associated with positive MRSA screening. Twelve patients (1.7%, 95% CI 0.7-2.6%) who were MRSA negative at admission tested positive for MRSA on hospital day 5. The clinical MRSA infection incidence rate was 1.4% (95% CI 0.7-2.0%). The screening test for MRSA at admission demonstrated a sensitivity of 23.5% (95% CI 6.8-49.9%) and specificity of 94.5% (95% CI 93-95.7%) for predicting MRSA infection. MRSA infections were associated with increased lengths of stay: intensive care unit 17.7 versus 5.1 days, p &lt; 0.001, hospital 23.1 versus 8.6 days, p &lt; 0.001.
During a 4-year period, 12,759 adult trauma patients were admitted to our Level I Trauma Center of which 1,812 (14.2%) underwent emergent laparotomy. Of these, 104 (5.7%) were treated with DCL: nonobese, n = 51 (49%); obese, n = 38 (37%); and severely obese, n = 15 (14%). In a multivariate adjusted model, multiple system organ failure was 1.82 times more likely in severely obese (95% CI: 1.14-2.90) and 1.74 times more likely in the obese patients (95% CI: 1.14-2.66) when compared with patients with normal BMI after DCL (p &lt; 0.01). In the severely obese patients undergoing DCL, significantly elevated prevalence ratios (PR) for development of postoperative infectious complications, acute renal insufficiency, and failure of primary abdominal wall fascial closure were 1.75, 3.07, and 2.62, respectively. Days of ventilator support, length of stay, and mortality rates were significantly higher in severely obese patients (24 days, 27 days, and 60%) compared with obese (14 days, 14 days, and 21%) and nonobese (9.8 days, 14 days, and 28%) patients.
The subjects were 282 trauma patients. Their mean age was 44.0 +/- 20.4 years old, and their mean injury severity score was 15.8 +/- 13.1. Ammonia was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure, shock index at admission, infusion volume, base deficit, and injury severity score. Forty-one patients required blood transfusion and 31 needed intervention for arterial bleeding. Because some patients required both therapies, the bleeding group consisted of 46 patients. The control group consisted of 236 patients who needed neither blood transfusion nor intervention. The plasma ammonia concentration in the bleeding group (113 +/- 52.2 microg/dL) was significantly higher than in the control group (55.4 +/- 20.8 microg/dL). In the bleeding group, the ammonia concentration of patients who died from bleeding (170 +/- 68.7 microg/dL) was significantly higher than in survivors (102 +/- 40.7 microg/dL). The best ammonia concentration cutoff value that maximized sensitivity and specificity to select for the bleeding group was &gt; or = 77 microg/dL (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 89%).
Two hundred and forty-one patients (age 52 years +/- 21 years) were studied. In 28 patients (12%), one or more RBCs were administered with a mean of 2.2 RBCs (range, 1-4). Hb decreased to 10.9 g/dL +/- 2.1 g/dL on day 3. RC rose from 16 +/- 11 at admission to 38 promille +/- 21 promille on day 13 (p &lt; 0.0001). Nadir Hb values and maximum RC values were inversely related according to univariate analysis (Pearson R = -0.62, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, Hb remained the only significant determinant of RC (R = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001).
Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with HF. The mean ISS was 47 +/- 14. Fulminant, intermediate, or late HF (n = 11 each group) resulted in 100%, 91%, or 73% mortality, respectively, with the best prognosis for late HF (p = 0.0031). The actual overall mortality of HF (88%) exceeded the predicted trauma and injury severity score mortality (70%) (p = 0.039). Lower PC (123 +/- 53 vs. 193 +/- 91; p = 0.034), ROTEM prolonged clot formation time [CFT, 359 (140/632) vs. 82 (14/190); p = 0.042], and lower platelet contribution to maximum clot firmness [MCF(EXTEM) - MCF(FIBTEM), 34 (20/40) vs. 46 (40/53); p = 0.026] were associated with increased mortality.
Intramuscular injection of glycerol significantly increased blood BUN, Cre, GOT, GPT, CPK levels and induced severe histopathologic damage in the kidneys. NF-kappaB and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were increased, and E-cadherin was decreased after glycerol administration, as detected by immunohistochemistry in the kidneys. Posttreatment with pentobarbital decreased blood BUN, Cre, GOT, GPT, CPK levels, decreased the markers of kidney injury, and suppressed the release of NF-kappaB and iNOS after rhabdomyolysis.
The mean age of patients was 38 years. Thirteen cases involved skin defects over the dorsum of the hand associated with extensor tendon and bone injuries. The skin defect was covered with posterior interosseous artery (PIA) flap in 12 cases. In one case, the PIA pedicle was found to be injured so radial forearm flap was used. The main intervention time for these cases was 6.2 days. All flaps except two PIA flap survived uneventfully. One flap was completely lost while other survived with distal necrosis. In remaining seven cases the thumb was the main injured part; it had complete disruption of its arterial supply and was managed with amputation with or without matarcarpal removal. These cases were managed immediately.
The average flexion arc was 129 degrees (range, 110-145 degrees) and the average forearm rotation arc was 166 degrees (range, 120-180 degrees). According to the Mayo Elbow Performance Index, elbow function was excellent in nine patients, good in four, fair in two, and poor in one patient. According to the classification system of Steinberg et al., there were three good, eight fair, and five poor results. The average score on the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire was 12 points (range, 0-52).
A total of 1,106 victims were examined of whom 83% had HNF injuries. Thirty-seven percent had more than one HNF injury. Injuries around the nose and mouth were significantly associated with male victims, whereas injuries to the neck were significantly more common among female victims. Most injuries were the results of assault with a blunt object, where the men much more frequently had open wounds, whereas injuries such as ecchymoses were significantly more frequent among female victims. Use of weapons, such as blunt objects and blows with glass/bottles, was associated much more with male victims, whereas strangulation attempts were significantly more frequent among women. Ten percent of the women had been exposed to strangulation attempts.
Thirty-three patients were included in the study. Contrast study detected all esophageal injuries, but failed to detect any hypopharyngeal injuries particularly in the intubated patients. Videoendoscopy detected all injuries, hypopharyngeal and esophageal in intubated and nonintubated patients.
The reducibility of acetabular fractures by conservative management stood at 18 of 32 (56.3%) synchronizing with 18 of 32 (56.3%) good to excellent clinical score. The mean clinical score was 14.25 +/- 3.41 of a total score of 18. In patients with good fracture reduction, good to excellent results were seen in 83.3% cases. The radiologic grade was good to excellent in 50% cases with good clinicoradiologic correlation (p = 0.0001).
Among patients with hip fractures, 85% of American and 58% of Dutch patients were prescribed narcotics during hospitalization (p &lt; 0.001). After discharge, 77% of American and none of the Dutch patients were prescribed narcotics (p &lt; 0.001). The multivariate model including country accounted for 11% of the variation in inpatient narcotic prescription (p &lt; 0.001), and the model including country and surgeon accounted for 55% of the variation in outpatient narcotic prescription (p &lt; 0.001). Among patients with ankle fracture, 98% of American and 64% of Dutch patients were prescribed narcotics during hospitalization (p &lt; 0.001). After discharge, 82% of American patients and 6% of Dutch patients were prescribed narcotics (p &lt; 0.001). Predictors included country and surgeon and they accounted for 20% of the variation in inpatient narcotics prescription (p &lt; 0.001) and 49% of the variation in outpatient narcotic prescription (p &lt; 0.001).
During macroscopic examination, all rabbits were dissected along the previous surgical wound in the distal femur. Dense osseous-like tissue was found in the prefabricated vascularized periosteum. The tissue sections showed red-mineralized matrix of Alizarin Red S staining increased neovascularization.
The most common cause of homicide was a gunshot wound injury, with a firearm mortality rate of 7.5/100,000 women, 14 years and older, in 1999, followed by sharp force injury (6.8/100,000) and blunt force injury (6.1/100,000). Gunshot victims were more likely to be African, and those killed by sharp force injury were more likely colored. Significantly, blunt force injury deaths occurred predominantly in intimate partner homicides. A full autopsy was performed only in 70% of cases. An assessment of postmortem reports revealed poor descriptions of the anatomic location of injuries and the specifications of wound dimensions.
Of 98 RRT activations, complete data were available for 82 (84%); 100% met activation criteria; and 76 (93%) occurred between 2100 and 0600. Seventy-six patients were 48 hours to 72 hours postoperative; six had nonoperatively managed injuries. The most common reason for activation was impending respiratory failure and acute volume overload (n = 72; 88%). RRT therapies included diuretics (n = 72), antiarrhythmics (n = 48), oxygen (n = 82), and bronchodilators (n = 36); only 2 received blood component therapy. Seventy-eight patients (95%) were transferred to higher level of care (61, surgical intensive care unit; 17, SSDU). Only 46% of patients required intubation. Performance improvement review identified 90% of physician related RRTs as preventable/potentially preventable because of errors in judgment or omission. Four RRTs because of patient disease were unpreventable. Two potentially preventable errors were each ascribed to RN or system concerns.
One thousand two hundred and thirty patients (35%) were transferred from level III (33%) and level IV (67%) centers (43% underwent an operative procedure). Only 13% required a laparotomy, whereas 87% needed procedures from other subspecialists. Referred patients had a mean injury severity score of 28, length of stay of 28 days, and mortality rate of 26%. More patients arrived hemodynamically unstable from level IV (55%) versus level III (35%) hospitals (p &lt; 0.05). Nonsurvivors from level III centers were more likely to transfer via aircraft (100%) than from level IV hospitals (55%) (p &lt; 0.05). Most (91%) definitive general surgery procedures could have been completed by surgeons at level III centers; however, 90% also had multisystem injuries requiring treatment by other subspecialists.
Patients treated at 30 pediatric trauma centers (mean volume = 451 +/- 258/patients per center) were evaluated. Mean O/E was 1.001 with SD = 0.404. Twenty-two centers fell within the reference range; O/E of 12 centers exceeded 1, suggesting performance below expectation. Trauma center volume, as reflected by sample, did not correlate to O/E performance.
Admissions increased 30%, representing a 7.6% annual increase (p = 0.004), mostly due to a nearly fivefold increase in interfacility transfers. Severe trauma patients (ISS &gt;24) increased 106% and mortality rate for ISS &gt;24 decreased by 47% to almost half the average of the National Trauma Database. There was a 78% increase in revenue and a sustained increase in hospital profitability.
Four hundred and forty-three patients had 465 admissions generating 2,896 notes. Overall, 76% of notes were signed and coded by an attending and billed. Incomplete (not billed) notes represented an overall missed billing opportunity of $159,138 for the 2-month time period (approximately $954,000 annually). Unbilled E&amp;M encounters during weekdays totaled $54,758, whereas unbilled E&amp;M and procedures from weeknights and weekends totaled $88,408 ($44,566 and $43,842, respectively). Missed billing after-hours thus represents approximately $530K annually, extrapolating to approximately $220K in collections from our payer mix. Surprisingly, missed E&amp;M and procedural billing during weekdays totaled $70,730 (approximately $425K billing, approximately $170K collections annually), and typically represented patients seen, but transferred from the SICU before attending documentation was completed.
Hypothermia and acidosis compromise thrombin-generation kinetics via different mechanisms. Hypothermia primarily inhibits the initiation phase, whereas acidosis severely inhibits the propagation phase of thrombin generation. Similarly, hypothermia and acidosis affect fibrinogen metabolism differently. Hypothermia inhibits fibrinogen synthesis, whereas acidosis accelerates fibrinogen degradation, leading to a potential deficit in fibrinogen availability. In addition, coagulation complications caused by acidosis cannot be immediately corrected by pH neutralization alone.
One hundred sixty-seven patients were enrolled over 30 days. All blast exposures resulted from primary or secondary explosions from munitions used in combat. This included both combatants and civilians. All patients were men. The mean patient age was 28 years (range, 12-55 years). Sixteen percent (27 of 167) of blast-exposed patients had TM perforation. Thirteen of 27 patients with perforations had bilateral perforations. Twelve of 167 patients (7%) had PBI. Six of 12 patients (50%) with PBI had TM perforation. The use of TM perforation as a biomarker for PBI resulted in a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI, 22-78%) and specificity of 87% (95% CI, 81-92%).
Between June 2005 and June 2008, the electronic surveillance system reported 39,718 injury-related visits to the pediatric emergency department. Falls were reported in 3,436 patients (2,107 males, 1,329 females). TBI occurred from falls in 171 patients. Although black children had a higher fall rate (69.24%) than white children (23.75%) and non-black, non-white children (7.01%), white children had the highest TBI rate from falls (9.47%). TBI from falls occurred at a lower mean age for females (5.40 +/- 4.45) than males (6.6 +/- 5.15) and for non-whites (5.98 +/- 4.88) than whites (6.21 +/- 4.93). Multiple logistic regression demonstrated a significant influence of age, race, and sex on the likelihood that a fall results in TBI. Females have a higher risk of TBI from falls than males from ages 0 to 11.5. This runs contrary to previous studies suggesting that toddler males are at highest risk for TBI.
Surveys were returned from 28 Allstate playground sites. The playgrounds were built within the last 6 years with the majority (64%) built 3 or more years ago. Although 17 of the playgrounds sustained minor vandalism, 11 of the sites reported the vandalism was corrected by the community. Community impact themes centered on revitalization and empowerment, safety, and social capital changes whereas school impact themes centered on socialization and health.
Children covered by booster seat legislation were less likely to be hospitalized for MV occupant injury than uncovered children (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88). MV occupant injury constituted a smaller proportion of total injury expenditures in children covered (4.9%) versus uncovered (6.9%) by booster seat legislation. Covered children residing in areas with zip code incomes above the median had 26% lower MV occupant/total injury (p = 0.001) compared with 13% lower MV occupant/total injury for those below the median income (p = 0.0712). The proportion of injury dollars spent for MV occupant injury was higher in self-pay children for covered (7.8%) and uncovered (8.9%) children.
Five hundred forty-two study participants were 37.8% black, 41.7% Hispanic, 10.5% white, and 10.0% other race. Whites more frequently owned/had safety devices including cabinet latches (chi2 =28.9, p &lt; 0.0001), drawer latches (chi2 =21.4, p &lt; 0.0001), bath thermometers (chi2 =22.5, p &lt; 0.0001), electric outlet covers (chi2 =15.9, p = 0.0004), and poison control number (chi 2=93.8, p &lt; 0.0001). Practice of unsafe behaviors, such as stomach sleep position, was higher in blacks (29.3%) than whites (15.8%) or Hispanics (17.7%) (chi2 =11.8, p &lt; 0.0083). Overall, 62.1% redeemed vouchers, but this varied significantly by ethnicity: blacks (42.2%), non-Hispanic whites (64.6%), and Hispanics (76.3%) (chi2 = 48.5, p &lt; 0.0001).
The final sample (n = 79) was mostly women (93.7%), Hispanic (78.5%), and foreign-born (77.2%). Six months after participating in the program, there was a statistically significant decrease in parental knowledge regarding appropriate safety seat transitions to booster seats and correct knowledge of the state child safety seat law-with odds ratios of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.13-0.93) and 0.16 (0.04-0.54), respectively. Most commonly reported motivators were safety and fear of police enforcement. Most commonly reported barriers to safety seat use were parents not understanding the importance of safety seats and being in a rush.
Of 331 patients (mean age, 9.96 years), an SBS was present in 54 (16%) of these children. Abdominal injury was identified by computed tomography scan or intraoperatively in 12 (22%) of these children. Three (6%) children with SBS required operative intervention. Two had a bowel injuries and one had a negative laparoscopy. SBS and abdominal tenderness were reported in 30 (56%) patients; 8 (15%) of whom sustained abdominal injury. Of the 277 (84%) children without SBS, 36 (13%) had abdominal injuries. Four (11%) of these had a positive laparotomy with three having a bowel injuries. The relative risk of an abdominal injury given an SBS was 1.7 (CI 0.96-2.69; p = 0.078). Four (1.4%) children without SBS died of head injuries compared with zero with SBS. The SBS had a sensitivity of 25% and a specificity of 85%.
Over 7 months, 295 caregivers were screened; 32.5% (n = 96) screened positive for risky alcohol use. For 173 injured children, one caregiver was screened, and for 61 children, two caregivers were screened. In the one-caregiver group, 29% (n = 50) screened positive for risky drinking. For the two-caregiver group, in 18% (n = 11) of the cases, both caregivers screened positive, whereas in 39% (n = 24) only one caregiver screened positive. Males were more likely to screen positive (p &lt; 0.01). Relationships between reported child safety behaviors and risky drinking were of interest, but not statistically significant.
MV injury accounted for 14.6% of all-cause injury-related hospital admissions with 47.7% classified as drivers. Total MV occupant mortality was 14.6% lower after enactment of GDL with greater improvement observed in the good law category (26.0%). In multivariate models for hospitalized injury, all GDL law categories were protective for MV driver injury in 16 year olds. Compared with whites, black and Hispanic teens were more frequently injured as passengers than drivers. The contribution of MV occupant to all-cause injury-related hospital charges was 16.0% lower in good versus no-GDL categories and 39.5% lower for MV drivers.
A total of 102 physicians completed both the pre and postsurveys. Thirty-nine percent (39%) reported having had a teen in their practice die in a motor vehicle crash in the presurvey, compared with 49% in the postsurvey. Physician counseling increased significantly for a number of issues: driving while impaired from 86% to 94%; restrictions on teen driving from 53% to 64%; teen driving laws from 53% to 63%; safe vehicle from 32% to 42%; parents model safe driving from 29% to 44%; and teen-parent written contract from 15% to 37%.
Teens and adults have dramatically different responses to the posters. The primary choice of the adults was never selected by the teens and the primary choice of the adolescents was never the choice of the adults. Interestingly, both groups agreed that one of the posters was ineffective.
Of the six original schools, one withdrew because of the death of a student in a motor vehicle crash. A total of 2,892 vehicles were observed. Significant increases were found for drivers (70.6-91.4%, p = 0.000), front passengers (51.1-67.9%, p = 0.000), and first rear passenger (26.2-68.8%, p = 0.002). Additional rear passenger use also increased, but small numbers created unstable results. The largest changes were seen in schools with closer trauma rep involvement. Odds ratios were computed for the likelihood of belted passengers based on driver seat belt use (baseline 9.08, follow-up 5.5).
In 2008, 11 schools agreed to participate in the challenge. More than 21,000 students were exposed to the safe driving messages through public address announcements, posters, mock car crashes, mothers against drunk driving car demonstrations, parent contracts, guest speakers, student developed videos, and web sites. In the end, all the schools documented an increase in seat belt use. The most improved school documented a 15% increase.
27.9% (n=290) of the 1,039 women were found to be experiencing depression at a level requiring treatment. In a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis model developed for depression and anxiety, the following were found to be statistically significant factors influencing the experience of both depression and anxiety: perceived social support; recent experience of marital or emotional problems during and before this pregnancy; recent experience of life stress; having a negative self-perception; experience of physical violence; and experience of physical problems during pregnancy. Statistically significant factors influencing depression were marital dissatisfaction, being a housewife, having an unwanted pregnancy, and having a formal marriage. The correlation between total anxiety and depression scores was at a medium level (Pearson correlation=0.592).
the analysis revealed four categories of responses: 'feeling confident with the technology'; 'feeling confident of having control of their privacy'; 'feeling confident being face-to-face on the VC'; and 'feeling confident when worries and concerns were met and answers were received'.
two main themes were conceptualised: (1) organisation of and situation at the workplace; and (2) the societal context. Three paradoxes became apparent. The midwives felt that their professional role in childbirth care had decreased in favour of other professionals, but they had a better dialogue with physicians and auxiliary nurses, which led to better teamwork and joint decisions. Secondly, the midwives expressed a strong professional identity on the basis of self-confidence and long experience, but their handcraft skills and clinical experience have become less valued due to increased medical technology and organisational changes that contributed to loss of locus of control. Finally, the midwives described a more humanised childbirth care and better collaboration with women/couples over the last decades. The couples are, however, more knowledgeable and enquiring, and the midwives expressed a fear that professional competency could be set aside. Furthermore, lack of trust in the normal birth process among women also affects midwives and the risk of litigation influences practice.
the findings indicated low levels of transparency and trust in antenatal visits. Lack of trust was related to categories such as conflicting personal capabilities and socio-cultural and medical expectations, combined with a didactic approach from caregivers. The unworthy woman was identified as the core category of the interviews describing how women feel in their relationship with midwives. A theoretical model illustrates possibilities for change in relation to an ideal situation where a supportive caregiver, congruent expectations and capabilities result in women feeling visible.
data were managed with QSR NVivo and analysis was influenced by the work of Strauss and Corbin. Two main themes emerged: midwifery as a career choice and future midwifery career. Findings indicated that students entered the course with preconceived ideas of midwifery and where they would practice after graduation. Clinical placements allowed students to experience the reality of midwifery practice, promote identification with the profession, and influenced decision-making about future careers. Finally, it raised limitations placed on diversity of available clinical experience.
out of a sample of 149 fathers, 72 (48.3%) returned the retest questionnaire. Sixty-five of these fathers had completed all the items, and thus only these cases were included in the data analysis. The mean age of the sample was 35.42+/-7.55 years. For 34 (52.3%) fathers, this was their first child. The mean total test score of fathers for the 35-item scale that assessed the feelings related to their wife/partner's delivery was 99.09+/-11.88 and the mean total retest score was 102.30+/-9.99. The correlation coefficient between the two scores was 0.975 (p&lt;0.001). The mean total test and retest scores for the 19-item scale that evaluated the experiences related to their wife/partner's delivery were 50.78+/-17.57 and 49.59+/-18.21, respectively. The correlation coefficient was 0.947 (p&lt;0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficients for the items of both scales ranged from 0.73 to 0.99, exceeding 0.85 in most cases.
the response to the 1999 baseline survey was 65.3% (1256/1922) and to the 2001 post-implementation survey 57.4% (1050/1829). Comparative analysis revealed a statistically significant improvement in overall ratings of hospital postnatal care; the level of advice and support received in relation to discharge and going home; the sensitivity of caregivers; and the proportion of women receiving domiciliary care after discharge. There was little change in the time women spent in hospital after birth between the two survey time-points. Over 90% of women reported one or more health problems in the first 3 months postpartum. The proportion of women reporting physical or emotional health problems between the two surveys did not change.
the following findings emerged from focus group data: Women's support groups (WSGs) provided an enabling environment in which women could form friendships, bond, discuss concerns about their reproductive health, and identify concrete ways of addressing them; Supportive friends, family members and advocates influenced women's decisions to seek health care at the Casa Materna; Women's decisions to seek care were often associated with their sense of self-worth and self-esteem, and women's self-esteem was enhanced by their participation in the WSGs; Women's decisions to seek care were influenced by the perception that women would be able to access culturally appropriate, safe and secure health care services at the Casa Materna; The learned behaviour of negotiation with key decision-makers and/or opinion leaders was an effective tool for convincing such individuals of the value of accessing facility-based care; The proven track record, high quality of services and cultural competence offered at the Casa Materna increased the confidence and level of trust of clients and their family members about the care that would be received; Couple-based education and health promotion were effective techniques for achieving behaviour and attitude change among both men and women.
the amount and intensity of exercise decreased over the course of pregnancy, with main reasons for not exercising including feeling tired or unwell, being too busy, and, particularly in late pregnancy, exercise being uncomfortable. Some women also reported safety concerns. Safety concerns predicted amount and/ or intensity of exercise.
126 (68%) mothers of 185 babies stillborn after 37 gestational weeks had held their baby and 82 (68%) mothers of 120 babies stillborn at gestational weeks 28-37 had also done so. Compared with mothers who agreed completely with the statement that staff gave enough support to hold the baby, mothers who did not agree were less likely to have held their baby [relative risk (RR) 4.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-6.1], and mothers with a low level of education were less likely to have held their baby than mothers with a higher level of education (RR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-3.8). Mothers who had not held their babies born after 37 gestational weeks had an increased risk of headache (RR 4.3; 95% CI 1.1-16.5), and they were less satisfied with their sleep (RR 2.7; 95% CI 1.5-5.0). The increased risk of long-term outcomes associated with not holding, compared with holding, a stillborn baby were less pronounced for women who gave birth at gestational week 28-37 compared with women who gave birth after 37 gestational weeks.
a postal questionnaire was sent to women 3-4 years after birth. The number of women who remained in the supine position throughout the second stage varied between midwifery practices, ranging from 31.3% to 95.9% (p&lt;0.001). The majority of women pushed and gave birth in the supine position. For positions used throughout the second stage of labour, a stepwise forward logistic regression analysis was used to examine effects controlled for other factors. Women aged 36 years and highly educated women were less likely to use the supine pushing position alone [odds ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.31-0.94; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.73, respectively]. Women who pushed for longer than 60 minutes and who were referred during the second stage of labour were also less likely to use the supine position alone (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.64; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.86, respectively). Bivariate analyses were conducted for effects on position at the time of birth. Age 36 years, higher education and homebirth were associated with giving birth in a non-supine position.
mothers and fathers had similar feelings concerning postnatal sense of security. Of the dimensions in the PPSS instrument, a sense of midwives'/nurses' empowering behaviour, a sense of one's own general well-being and a sense of the mother's well-being as experienced by the father were the most important dimensions for parents' experienced security. A sense of affinity within the family (for both parents) and a sense of manageable breast feeding (for mothers) were not significantly associated with their experienced security. A sense of participation during pregnancy and general anxiety were significantly associated background variables for postnatal sense of security for both parents. For the mothers, parity and a sense that the father was participating during pregnancy were also significantly associated.
the majority of midwives reported that the Uniject device was easier to use and preferable compared with ampoules and standard syringes. They found the training materials easy to understand.
Expression of MIP-2, KC, IL-1beta, and IL-6 was upregulated significantly in the infected group one, three, five, and seven days after surgery. Following treatment with an MIP-2 polyclonal antibody, the corneal clinical scores and inflammatory responses decreased, the MIP-2 protein levels were downregulated significantly (p&lt;0.01), and the KC protein levels decreased slightly (p&gt;0.05). Upon administration of IL-1beta polyclonal antibodies, the decrease in clinical scores, inflammatory responses, and protein levels of MIP-2 and KC was apparent at 1 and 3 days after infection (p&lt;0.01).
Current evidence from randomized controlled trials and a recent pooled analysis, show clear benefit from hemicraniectomy with improved survival and better functional outcomes.
Treatment approaches can be divided into 2 main categories. Extrinsic or "top-down" approaches require active participation of the patient under the guidance of a therapist. The most common approach of this type is visual scanning therapy in which the patient is continually instructed to move the gaze leftward into the neglected space. Intrinsic or "bottom-up" approaches manipulate stimulus characteristics, sensory input, or the brain directly in an attempt to alter the interhemispheral attentional imbalance. Examples of this approach include vestibular stimulation of the left side, sensory activation of the left limb, and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the overactive left hemisphere. Combined approaches such as prism adaptation have also shown good results.
The clinical manifestation and principles of management of acute intracranial hypertension are discussed and reviewed. Acute treatment protocols are presented in an algorithm-based format aimed at utilizing the current available management strategies and suggested therapeutic goals. Individualization of specific therapeutic modalities is emphasized to optimize the clinical outcome.
Migraine (41.2%) and tension-type headaches (20.6%) were the most common headaches in remission, and primary stabbing headache (PSH) (27.8%) was common in the relapsing phase. Although headaches seemed to occur independently of disease duration, extended disability status scale, beck depression inventory scores, and treatments, the total number of headaches was correlated with periventricular lesions (P = 0.03) and tension-type headaches were correlated with spinal lesions in remission (P = 0.02). Total number of headaches was correlated with brain stem lesions in the relapsing phase (P = 0.05).
Clinical symptoms of the present brothers were consistent with those of sporadic cases. Their lanky physique, clinical features, and MRI findings looked alike to each other.
Both patients had a good response to treatment and an excellent recovery. Despite clinical recovery, in a 6-month follow-up MRI lesions consistent with recurrence were disclosed, without any clinical findings or CSF abnormalities.
A randomized controlled trial (n = 541) showed that, compared with placebo, rivastigmine (mean, 8.6 mg/d) significantly improved scores on 2 coprimary cognitive outcome scales in PDD, including the Alzheimer disease Cooperative Study-Clinician's Global Impression of Change. When dichotomized to evaluate clinically significant benefit (moderate or marked improvement), this outcome was not significant (risk difference = 5.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.6 to 12.1). The number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid clinically significant worsening of cognition was 10 (95% CI = 6-28). The NNT for the combined outcome of either achieving clinically significant benefit or avoiding significant worsening was 7. The numbers needed to harm for cholinergic side effects were 9 (95% CI = 5-24) for parkinsonian symptoms and 11 (95% CI = 6-32) for rivastigmine discontinuation due to any side effect.
The ratio of acyl-ghrelin to desacyl-ghrelin in plasma was lower in patients than in controls. Single administration of the formula did not change plasma desacyl-ghrelin levels, but induced an increase in acyl-ghrelin levels. Two-week treatment with the formula was effective in increasing weight and acyl-ghrelin, along with improving nutritional status in patients.
Formula intolerance between groups (INTACT, 12.3% vs. PH, 13.7%) was similar for infants who completed the study or discontinued due to study physician-assessed formula intolerance. Overall study discontinuance based on parent- vs. study physician-assessed intolerance for all infants (14.4 vs.11.1%) was significantly different (P = 0.001).
The expression levels of miR-143 and -145 were decreased in most human gastric cancers examined, as previously reported to occur in colon tumors. The transfection of human gastric MKN-1 cells with miR-145 resulted in a greater growth inhibitory effect than that with miR-143, results which were contrary to those in colon cancers. In MKN-1 cells, an additive effect on growth inhibition was shown by the combined transfection with miR-143 and miR-145; further, higher sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was also observed following the transfection with miR-143 or miR-145. The possible candidate target messenger RNAs of miR-145 were identified to be insulin receptor substrate-1 and beta-actin.
Using sequence-specific shRNA, we have silenced the expression of p110alpha in SKOV3 cells. shRNA-mediated knockdown of p110alpha correlated in vitro with decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of p110alpha significantly delayed the growth of ovarian carcinoma xenografts, and ultimately resulted in decreased cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis as well as a reduction in microvessel density.
Five patients had persistent TIN upon rebiopsy. Each of the patients failing to chemotherapy had undergone 2 or 3 cycles of the PEB regimen, while 3 had received carboplatin treatment. Two of the patients with no TIN upon rebiopsy developed invasive testis cancer subsequently. In summary, 7 of 11 patients thus failed to chemotherapy (64%; exact 95% confidence interval 30.8-89.1%). Three of the patients had complete absence of spermatogenesis upon rebiopsy histologically, while the remaining cases showed various forms of spermatogenetic arrest. Three of the failing patients were rescued by local radiotherapy, 4 patients underwent partial orchidectomy followed by local radiotherapy. No relapse occurred thereafter.
181 (16%) of the oncological questionnaires were sent back. For 61% of the participating centers, a histological confirmation of PC diagnosis is obligatory. 21% of physicians offer neoadjuvant therapy to patients with potentially resectable PC. In the adjuvant treatment after curative-intent surgery, gemcitabine (Gem) is regarded as standard of care by 71% after R0 resection and 62% after R1 resection. For patients with locally advanced PC, 52% of the participating centers recommend systemic chemotherapy, 17% prefer combined primary chemoradiotherapy. Most centers (59%) base their decision of combination regimens for metastatic disease on the performance status of their patients. In patients with a good status, 28% apply single-agent Gem, 3% use Gem + capecitabine, 12% Gem + erlotinib, 16% Gem + oxaliplatin, and 8% Gem + cisplatin. Only 28% of the survey doctors offer second-line treatment to the majority of their patients with advanced PC.
Thirty-five eligible patients were enrolled and received a total of 151 cycles of treatment (median 3, range 1-19). One complete response and 13 partial responses were observed, with an overall response rate of 40% (95% CI: 24-56%). Median progression-free survival and median overall survival times were 4.5 and 14.2 months, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (23%) and leukocytopenia (15%).
Podoplanin expression was exclusively confined to stromal fibroblasts and absent in tumor cells. Podoplanin is absent in normal stroma except for lymphatic vessels. Staining was considered positive when over 30% of the cancer stroma was stained. Positive podoplanin expression was significantly correlated with a more distal tumor localization (p = 0.013) and a shallower depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.011). Univariate analysis revealed that negative podoplanin expression in stromal fibroblasts was significantly associated with reduced disease-specific survival (p = 0.0017) and disease-free survival (p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that negative podoplanin expression (p = 0.016) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.027) were significantly associated with disease-free survival. CRC cell invasion was augmented by co-culture with CAFs that were treated with siRNA for podoplanin.
Overall, 44 patients received a total of 197 courses of therapy. Both drugs were given on days 1, 8 and 15 to 14 patients (68 courses). Delayed white blood cell recovery necessitated first protocol amendment to drop cyclophosphamide on days 8 and 15 in 9 patients (43 cycles). A second amendment was needed to drop gemcitabine on day 15 because of thrombocytopenia in 21 patients (86 courses). The dose-limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia. The MTD of an optimal dose schedule was 800 mg/m2 gemcitabine infused at a rate of 10 mg/m2/min on days 1 and 8, and 400 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, by intravenous piggyback injection, on day 1, 4 h after initiation of the gemcitabine infusion.
Forty-five patients were enrolled between January 2005 and June 2008. Among these, 29 patients received S-1 as first-line chemotherapy and 16 patients received S-1 as second-line chemotherapy. The response rates for first- and second-line chemotherapy were 17.2 and 18.8%, respectively. The median times to progression for the first- and second-line chemotherapy groups were 4.2 and 5.5 months (p = 0.91), respectively. The median overall survival and 1-year survival rate for each group were 8.7 and 8.0 months and 42.2 and 38.2%, respectively (p = 0.62). Only the first-line chemotherapy group experienced grade 3/4 toxicities, including leukopenia (6.9%), neutropenia (10.3%), anemia (6.9%), thrombocytopenia (10.3%) and total bilirubin elevation (3.4%).
A total of 100 ESRD patients without acute coronary syndrome (mean age of 58.5 years, 34% with diabetes, and 37% with CAD) gave 267 pre-dialysis and 260 post-dialysis blood samples. The mean (standard deviation) pre-dialysis cTnT levels were 0.06 (0.12), 0.05 (0.06), and 0.07 (0.07) mcg/L at 0, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The post-dialysis cTnT levels were similar on average. Among 259 samples with cTnT measured both before and after dialysis, 79 (30.5%) showed a decrease in serum cTnT, 97 (37.5%) showed an increase and 83 (32%) showed no change following dialysis. Mean cTnT was higher in CAD than in non-CAD patients. We observed no significant difference in mean cTnT levels between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
This review covered a total of 6 studies (323 subjects). No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of pain intensity (VAS): 0.02 (-0.24 a 0.28) or withdrawals: RR 0.91 (0.53 a 1.58)
IOL type (p = 0.0447), C(3)F(8) gas tamponades (p = 0.0074), preoperative iris posterior synechiae (p = 0.0001) and postoperative AC fibrin deposition (p = 0.0303) were significantly associated with postoperative iris posterior synechiae by multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for single-piece IOL versus 3-piece IOL was 2.658 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.010-6.993), the OR for C(3)F(8) gas versus balanced salt solution was 4.051 (95% CI: 1.455-11.281), for the presence of preoperative iris posterior synechiae 12.868 (95% CI: 3.511-47.165), and the OR for postoperative AC fibrin deposition was 6.012 (95% CI: 1.186-30.468).
In the tocopherol group, the relative risk for trabeculectomy failure decreased from 1.58 at 2 weeks (p = 0.95) to 1.0 at 1 year. Success rates (67-90%) and IOP reduction (mean 39 to 53%) were statistically comparable in the two groups. Considering postoperative complications, no relevant differences were found.
In the cidofovir group, significant narrowing of lacrimal canaliculus, redness of eyelids and conjunctival injection were observed, but no obstruction of the lacrimal duct was found. Histology showed eosinophils, suggesting an allergic inflammation. Although zalcitabine and stavudine induced eyelid redness and conjunctival injection, no change was observed in the lacrimal pathway.
Median plasma concentration of OPN in patients with metastatic disease was 152.01 ng/ml compared to 47.39 ng/ml in patients without clinically detectable metastases (p &lt; 0.001). The difference between the median MIA plasma levels in patients with (13.11 ng/ml) and patients without (5.64 ng/ml) metastatic disease was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). No correlation could be found between MIA or OPN levels and tumor height in patients without clinically detectable metastases.
In 7 eyes (23.3%), both RT and RCT were normal. In 5 eyes (16.6%), they were both increased. In the other 18 eyes (60%), the RCT was increased while the RT was normal, thus indicating a thickening of the choroid alone. No significant correlation was found between choroidal thickness and the presence of vitreal abnormalities. Neither increases in RT nor those in RCT were significantly related to visual acuity. No correlation was found between RT or RCT and pharmacological treatment.
The mean values of inferior average, temporal-superior-nasal-inferior temporal average, superior average and the number (nerve fiber indicator) were significantly lower in the eyes with RNFL defects than in the control group, when compared with the obtained linear discriminating function. The area under the curve values for receiver-operating characteristics analysis of the new parameter were 5% better than the best GDx-VCC standard values.
GAT correlated strongly with CCT (p = 0.0002), but there was no correlation between DCT and CCT (p = 0.4388). No correlation was found between IOP values obtained with both devices and age. The Bland and Altman plot evidenced a lack of agreement between both tonometers with 95% limits of agreement between 1.6 and -5.6 mm Hg.
Submacular fluid disappeared in all eyes 1 month after PDT and there was no recurrence during the follow-up. Visual acuity increased two or more lines in 5 eyes. Hyperautofluorescence in the area of previous retinal detachment significantly increased in the first month of PDT compared to preoperative findings. After the first month during the follow-up, increased AF in the area of previous retinal elevation returned to the baseline intensity.
Postoperative corneal epithelialization was completed in 5.62 +/- 1.74 days in group 1, 4.33 +/- 0.91 days in group 2 and 4.79 +/- 1.39 days in group 3. Corneal epithelialization time was earlier in group 2 than in groups 1 (p &lt; 0.01) and 3 (p &lt; 0.05). Recurrences were detected in 19 eyes (39.58%) in group 1, 11 eyes (14.29%) in group 2 and 12 eyes (23.08%) in group 3. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in group 2 than in groups 1 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001). Postoperative complications were not seen in any of the groups. Graft retraction and necrosis were not detected in the LCAT and AMGT groups during the follow-up period.
Both patients showed initial improvement when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab followed by deterioration and development of a large subretinal haemorrhage when changing to intravitreal ranibizumab.
In group 1, successful treatment was achieved in 37.5% of patients 6 months after the last operation, compared with 71.4% in group 2 (p=0.019). All patients were supported with antibiotics. In group 1, three patients died from septic multiorgan failure. Two patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 received a Girdlestone operation.
The average mIS in extension was 1.63+/-0.31 with the patient lying and 1.68+/-0.31 with the patient standing. In 30 degrees flexion and lying, it was 1.7+/-0.3. The mIS on the recommended radiographs (30 degrees flexion) correlated well with the mIS in extension while lying (R=0.48, p&lt;0.001) and standing (R=0.99, p&lt;0.001). The CD in extension was 0.78+/-0.21 while lying and 0.49+/-0.12 while standing; it was 0.48+/-0.15 in 30 degrees flexion. The CD on the recommended radiographs (30 degrees flexion) correlated satisfactorily with the CD in extension while standing (R=0.93, p&lt;0.001) but not in extension while lying (not significant).
A total of eight systematic reviews, primarily summarizing results from case series, and 11 controlled studies, two of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were included. Both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty significantly reduce pain in the majority of patients and can lead to short-term and possibly long-term improvement of function. Kyphoplasty induces fewer clinically relevant complications than vertebroplasty does, and there is presently stronger evidence for its efficacy compared with vertebroplasty. There is inconclusive evidence about the risk of new fractures after kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.
For the inferior cortical thickness, only the high-impact group differed significantly (approximately 60%, p = 0.012) from the reference group, while for the anterior cortex, both the high-impact and odd-impact groups differed (approximately 20%, p = 0.042 and p = 0.044, respectively). Also, the posterior cortex was approximately 20% thicker (p = 0.014 and p = 0.006, respectively) in these two groups.
In 2005, there were 17,625 hip fractures diagnosed in Poland which was 30.2% less than the number of hospital discharge notes containing such a diagnosis in that year. In the over-50-year-old population, hip fracture incidence was found to be 89/100,000 for men and 165/100,000 for women. In the 50-65-year band, hip fracture incidence was higher in men than in women. The remaining lifetime probability of hip fracture at the age of 50 years was 2.0% for men and 4.5% for women which are among the lowest in Europe.
The study cohort included 32,804 patients. After 1 year, a significant difference in persistence on oral BP therapy was found. The patients started on branded risedronate were 11% more likely to stop OP therapy than patients started on branded alendronate. Risk of discontinuation doubled in patients initiated with generic alendronate compared to patients started on branded alendronate. Male gender was associated with a 25% increase risk of early discontinuation. No statistical association was found between previous OP fracture and early discontinuation.
Of 631 women with a DXA measurement, 187 (30%) had osteoporosis (T-score &lt; -2.5 at the spine or the hip). Of the remaining 444 women with T-score &gt;or= -2.5 at both spine and hip, 387 had additional spine radiographs, of whom 80 (21%) had at least one vertebral deformity.
Lean mass was positively correlated with the three T scores accounting for 11.6%, 26.6%, and 12.2% of the variability in the lumbar spine L1-L4, femoral neck, and total body BMD T scores, respectively. Fat mass had no effect on BMD. However, fat mass was positively correlated with aortic PWV, accounting for 9.8% of its variability. Lean mass was not a determinant of PWV. Hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were associated with higher PWV but had no effect on BMD.
Bisphosphonate use was observed in 15 of the 41 subtrochanteric/shaft cases, compared to nine of the 82 intertrochanteric/femoral neck controls (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR), 4.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77-11.35]; P = 0.002). A common X-ray pattern was identified in ten of the 15 subtrochanteric/shaft cases on a bisphosphonate. This X-ray pattern was highly associated with bisphosphonate use (OR, 15.33 [95% CI 3.06-76.90]; P &lt; 0.001). Duration of bisphosphonate use was longer in subtrochanteric/shaft cases compared to both hip fracture controls groups (P = 0.001).
Morphology and fatigue properties were the same in both groups. Samples failed between 10 min and 15 h. Force-displacement curves displayed typical fatigue behavior. Displacement increased over time due to mostly creep and to decreasing secant stiffness.
The study population consisted of 629 participants (380 males). Reference centile curves were produced; total and trabecular BMD for age (distal radius) and for age and height, bone area (distal and mid-shaft radius), cortical area, cortical thickness, BMC, axial moment of inertia, stress-strain index and muscle area (mid-shaft radius).
Diabetes was associated with reduced bone mineral content (BMC) and smaller bone cross-sectional size. Diabetic boys seemed to be more affected than diabetic girls. Among the boys, the mean deficit in BMC of all measured skeletal sites was more than 10%, while among the girls it was less than 5%.
In the females treated with 25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 microg of vitamin D3 daily the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations increased significantly from 32.4 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- SEM) to 50.8 +/- 2.9, from 46.7 +/- 2.8 to 65.8 +/- 2.6, from 41.6 +/- 2.7 to 67.4 +/- 2.9, from 46.7 +/- 1.4 to 64.4 +/- 2.2 and from 42.1 +/- 2.0 to 71.2 +/- 2.8 nmol/L, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). S-calcium increased significantly but within the reference range (p &lt; 0.006).
Strontium ranelate prevented ovariectomy-induced deterioration in mechanical properties with energy necessary for fracture completely maintained vs. SHAM at 625 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to the clinical dose. This was related to a dose-dependent effect on bone volume, higher trabeculae number, and lower trabecular separation in strontium ranelate vs. OVX. Load and energy required to induce lamella deformation were higher with strontium ranelate than in OVX and in SHAM, indicating that the bone formed with strontium ranelate is able to withstand greater damage before fracture. Bone formation was maintained high or even increased in strontium ranelate as shown by mineralizing surfaces and alkaline phosphatase while strontium ranelate led to reductions in deoxypyridinoline.
During 1,786 women-years of follow-up, 68 clinical fragility fractures occurred in 61 women. Older age and previous fracture were identified as risk factors for the present fractures. A decrease of 1 standard deviation in BMD values yielded a 1.5-fold (HIP) to 1.8-fold (T-EPI) significant increase in clinical fragility fracture hazard ratio (adjusted for age and previous fracture). All measured sites had comparable performance for fracture prediction (area under the curve range from 0.63 [LS] to 0.68 [T-EPI]).
Daily 1 mg minodronate for 24 months reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 59% (95% CI, 36.6-73.3%). Furthermore, when fractures during the first 6 months were eliminated, the risk of vertebral fractures from 6 to 24 months was reduced by 74% in minodronate-treated group. Minodronate treatment also reduced height loss. Bone turnover markers were suppressed by about 50% after 6 months of minodronate treatment and remained suppressed thereafter. The overall safety profile including gastrointestinal safety was similar between the two groups.
The Loading and Loading + Monthly groups showed increases in 25OHD of 58 +/- 28 nmol/L from baseline to 1 month. Thereafter, levels gradually declined to plateaus of 69 +/- 5 nmol/L and 91 +/- 4 nmol/l, respectively. In the Monthly group, 25OHD reached a plateau of ~80 +/- 20 nmol/L at 3-5 months. There were no changes in serum calcium concentrations. PTH and P1NP were only suppressed by vitamin D treatment in those with baseline 25OHD levels &lt;50 and &lt;30 nmol/L, respectively.
Predictors, which were race and site specific, included age, age at menarche, body weight, height, months of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use, weight-bearing exercise, and alcohol use. Women of all races gained BMC and BMD at the spine up to 30-33 years of age. BMC and BMD of the femoral neck peaked among white women earlier (&lt;or=16 years) than among blacks (BMC 22 years; BMD 21 years) and Hispanics (BMC 29 years; BMD 20 years).
Currently, the search for microcracks relies on bulk staining of bone samples, which are then examined on optic microscopy and fluorescence or confocal microscopy. The accumulation of microdamage is associated with fatigue loading and is likely to trigger targeted bone remodeling, especially in cortical bone. Several studies examining beagle dogs receiving bisphosphonates have shown a dose-dependent accumulation of microdamage in bone, with conflicting results regarding the consequences on bone mechanical properties. In living humans, obtaining data is limited to the iliac crest bone. The potential association between long-term bisphosphonate use and microcrack accumulation at the iliac crest bone has not been established unequivocally.
Overall, depression was associated with a significant decrease in mean BMD of spine (-0.053 g/cm(2) [95% confidence interval {CI} -0.087 to -0.018 g/cm(2)]) and hip (-0.052 g/cm(2) [95% CI -0.083 to -0.022 g/cm(2)]). A substantially greater BMD decrease was observed in depressed women (-0.076 g/cm(2) in spine; -0.059 g/cm(2) in hip) and in cases of clinical depression (-0.074 g/cm(2) in spine; -0.080 g/cm(2) in hip).
While remodeling intensity on an envelope determines structure (e.g., trabecular perforations), the surface area of the envelope determines remodeling intensity, and, so, structure. High remodeling on trabecular surfaces decreases as trabeculae (with their surface) are lost. Conversely, remodeling on the endocortical and intracortical envelopes increases their surface area, so remodeling intensity increases and bone loss becomes predominantly cortical.
We used 3T3-L1 adipocytes to study by imaging approaches the localization of Rab4b and to determine the consequence of its down regulation on glucose uptake and endogenous GLUT4 location. We found that Rab4b was localized in endosomal structures in preadipocytes whereas in adipocytes it was localized in GLUT4 and in VAMP2-positive compartments, and also in endosomal compartments containing the transferrin receptor (TfR). When Rab4b expression was decreased with specific siRNAs by two fold, an extent similar to its decrease in obese diabetic subjects, we observed a small increase (25%) in basal deoxyglucose uptake and a more sustained increase (40%) in presence of submaximal and maximal insulin concentrations. This increase occurred without any change in GLUT4 and GLUT1 expression levels and in the insulin signaling pathways. Concomitantly, GLUT4 but not TfR amounts were increased at the plasma membrane of basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. GLUT4 seemed to be targeted towards its non-endosomal sequestration compartment.
We show lysosomal storage, impaired autophagy, accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and mitochondrial dysfunction in fibroblasts from mucopolysaccharidosis VI patients. We observe similar anomalies, along with inflammation and cell death, in association with dermatan sulfate storage in the visceral organs of mucopolysaccharidosis VI rats, but not in their central nervous system where dermatan sulfate storage is absent. Importantly, we show that prevention of dermatan sulfate storage in the mucopolysaccharidosis VI rat visceral organs by gene transfer results in correction of abnormal autophagy, inflammation, and apoptosis, suggesting that dermatan sulfate accumulation impairs lysosomal ability to receive and degrade molecules and organelles from the autophagic pathway, thus leading to cell toxicity.
Significantly raised phase angle values as well as significantly increased BCM-(%) values and a decreased ECM/BCM index were found in the group of patients who exercised compared with the COPD patients who did not exercise. While there were no differences concerning the BMI value, significant increases in BCM-(%) and phase angle and a significant decrease of the ECM/BCM index could be detected within the group that had been exercising. The best values were recorded after 6 months of exercising. The differences of the group responses resulted from a worsening of the body composition in the control group rather than from improvements in the exercise group.
Epidemiological studies point to an association between chronic particulate matter exposure and mortality. The most prominent effects on the human body are present in subjects with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions. However, the effects of air pollutants need to be examined critically and the plausibility of thresholds should be evaluated in detail.
The study results illustrate that a physician's working day amounted to an average of 9 hours 15 minutes (SD = 0 : 46 : 59 h). Within this time span different time periods were spent on administrative tasks, internal communication and meetings as well as on communication with patients, ward rounds and medical examinations.
Open loop: the 3 devices showed marked differences in the rate of pressure rise but did not differ from the earlier published results. From an initial pressure of 4 mbar the pressure increased to 10 mbar after a different number of apnoeas (1-6 repetitive apnoeas). Only one device differentiated between closed and open apnoeas. Closed loop: due to the pressure increase, the flow generator simulated reduced obstruction of the upper airways (apnoeas changed to hypopnoeas, hypopnoeas changed to flattening) but different patterns of pressure regulation could still be observed.
The complete data from 1340 subjects (1057 adults and 283 children) were included for further analysis. At least one positive reaction to a tested aeroallergen was observed in 24.4% of studied subjects (24% of adults and 25.4% of children). Positive tests were observed most frequently in the group of patients with rhinitis. 12.2% of subjects showed a positive skin reaction without clinical symptoms of an allergic disease. The most common sensitizing allergens were house dust mites. No significant differences in sex and age between groups with positive SPT and negative SPT were observed in the study. Statistically significant differences between the studied regions (p = 0.037) were noticed in the case of the number of positive reactions and the kind of sensitizing allergen.
We studied 533 consecutive OSA patients, mean age 55.6 +/- 10.3 years (range 24-81), with obesity (BMI 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2)) and severe OSA (AHI/RDI 37.8 +/- 21.8). To evaluate relations between CVD and age, patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 &lt; 50 years (123 subjects, 23.1%), Group 2 aged 50-60 years (250 subjects, 46.9%) and Group 3 &gt; 60 years (160 subjects, 30%). Subjects &lt; 50 years were more obese and had higher AHI/RDI when compared to older groups. Incidence of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and stroke increased with age (higher in subjects &gt; 60 years).
In 26 (59.1%) of 44 patients physiologic bacterial flora was found in the bronchial tree. In three cases (6.8%), potentially pathological bacteria were cultured but their number was &lt; 104 cfu/ml. In 15 (34.1%) cases, the colonization of potentially pathogenic bacteria was &gt;or= 104 cfu/ml. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. The most frequently isolated bacterium in the first group was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), and in the second group Haemophilus influenzae (n = 3). Multibacterial colonization was found in five patients (11.4%). In four cases (9.1%), the bronchial tree was colonized simultaneously by two and in one case [2.3%] by three types of micro-organism. Multi-drug-resistant strains were not found in the examined materials but among Streptococcus pneumoniae the constitutive MLSB phenotype was observed.
Questionnaires were filled in by 1960 subjects (87% of those eligible). There were 29.6% current smokers, 24.9% ex-smokers, and 45.5% never-smokers. There were 39.4% current smokers among men, and 23.3% among women. Current smokers were more numerous in the rural population. 54% of women urban dwellers and 73% of women from rural population never smoked. There were no significant differences in the motivation to stop smoking or in the nicotine dependence among smokers with and without COPD nor according to the severity of COPD.
Mean BM thickness was 12.8 +/- 2.8 microm (range: 8.5-20.7 microm). No significant correlations between BM thickness and FEV1% pred., FEV1%VC, FVC% pred., RV% pred., TLC% pred., Raw (pre- and post-bronchodilator) and PC20 were observed.
White matter injury was detected in all LPS-treated fetuses, whereas no abnormalities were seen in control animals or in LPS-treated mothers. Maternal and fetal S100B protein levels were significantly higher in the LPS group than in the control group at all monitoring time points (P &lt; .001). The highest fetal-maternal S100B levels were observed at 3-hour time-point (P &lt; .001).
Exposure to cotton particles stimulated cytokine synthesis by macrophages from all three sources; exposure to cyclic hydrostatic pressure alone did not stimulate cytokine synthesis significantly. However, the combination of both particles and cyclic hydrostatic pressure increased the simulation of cytokine synthesis still further. Cell characterization demonstrated that the large majority of cells had a macrophage morphology and were positive for CD14 and CD68.
Total soy consumption was positively correlated with observed lung function measures. The mean soy intake was significantly higher among controls (59.98, SD 50.23 g/day) than cases (44.84, SD 28.5 g/day). A significant reduction in COPD risk was evident for highest versus lowest quartile of daily intake of total soybean products, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.392, 95% CI 0.194-0.793, p for trend 0.001. Similar decreases in COPD risk were associated with frequent and higher intake of soy foods such as tofu and bean sprouts, whereas respiratory symptoms were inversely associated with high consumption of soy foods, especially for breathlessness (OR 0.989, 95% CI 0.982-0.996).
Among the 575 patients with pulmonary hypertension, 6 (mean age 42.5 +/- 8.3 years) were identified as having received a VA shunt. Mean pulmonary artery pressure for these patients was 53.3 +/- 14.9 mm Hg. The interval between shunt placement and the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was 9-27 years (median 16.5). While ventilation perfusion scans showed multiple bilateral perfusion defects in all patients, chest CT or pulmonary angiography demonstrated pulmonary thromboembolism in only 2 of the 6 patients. These 2 patients subsequently underwent pulmonary endarterectomy. Another patient required heart-lung transplantation because of severe pulmonary hypertension; lung histology showed prominent eccentric medial hypertrophy and intimal proliferation without evidence of thromboembolism. Contrary to earlier reports, outcomes were generally good, with a 100% survival rate for the first 8 years following diagnosis.
The 2677 GG genotype was associated with a significantly better response to chemotherapy compared with the combined 2677 GT and TT genotype (p = 0.035). The 3435 CC genotype was also associated with a better response to chemotherapy compared with the combined 3435 CT and TT genotypes although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.123). Moreover, patients harboring the 2677G-3435C haplotype had a statistically significant better response to chemotherapy compared with those with the other haplotypes combined (p = 0.015).
Asbestos fiber concentration was always below permissible levels. Fifty-two workers died during the study. The cause was cancer in 28 subjects; lung cancer was diagnosed in 16 of them. No case of mesothelioma was reported. Death was attributed to cardiovascular diseases in 23 subjects and to liver cirrhosis in 1. Overall mortality rate was significantly lower than that of the Greek general population, standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 0.71 (95% CI 0.53-0.93). Mortality due to cancer was increased (SMR 1.15, 95% CI 0.77-1.67), mainly due to lung cancer mortality (SMR 1.71, 95% CI 0.98-2.78), but not significantly.
The total number of cells was significantly higher in IS samples of SSc patients compared to those of healthy controls. Mean percentage of neutrophils was also higher in SSc patients (41.79 +/- 23.89 vs. 27.37 +/- 17.90), as well as lymphocytes (17.42 +/- 19.70 vs. 3.13 +/- 2.28) and eosinophils (2.35 +/- 4.43 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.46). On the other hand, mean percentage of macrophages was higher in healthy individuals (69.10 +/- 19.15 vs. 36.96 +/- 20.68). In fluid recovered by BAL, the most frequent cells were macrophages (67.89% +/- 17.26), while neutrophils (14.77 +/- 17.18%) and lymphocytes (15.62 +/- 13.46%) were less frequent and eosinophils (1.66 +/- 2.08%) were rare. A similar pattern of cell composition was found in IS samples (41.15 +/- 21.67% of macrophages, 39.72 +/- 23.15% of neutrophils, 15.28 +/- 19.46% of lymphocytes and 2.56 +/- 5.03% of eosinophils). Strength of correlation between BAL and IS was significant for macrophages and neutrophils. After IS procedure was performed, improvement of FEV(1) (mean value before IS was 85.09 +/- 14.44 and 88.93 +/- 16.40 after IS) and FEV(1)/forced vital capacity (mean value before IS was 98.53 +/- 12.11 and 105.22 +/- 10.78 after IS) was observed.
Of the 178 patients enrolled, 30.4% presented to hospital 1 week after the start of their symptoms and there was an average of 8.4 +/- 11.4 days' (median 4 days, range 0-75) delay to presentation. The delay from presentation to diagnosis was 0.9 +/- 1.9 days (median 0, range 0-16). Patients with hypotension, respiratory rate &gt;20 and atelectasis in spiral CT presented earlier. However, no correlation was found between delays and the level of thromboembolic occlusion in pulmonary artery.
Adenocarcinoma (45.0%, n = 18) was the most common histological type of lung cancer and when PE was diagnosed, the majority of the lung cancer patients were in stages IIIB (37.5%, n = 15) and IV (47.5%, n = 19). Thirty-four patients (85.0%) were diagnosed with PE within 12 months of the diagnosis of lung cancer. The median survival from the diagnosis of PE was 3.5 months in the PE group, but the survival rates revealed no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.249). In both groups, the most common cause of death was lung cancer progression (76.9 and 80.3%, respectively), followed by chemotherapy-related septic shock (19.2 and 16.7%, respectively).
CCPA (10 nM-3 microM) inhibited NANC relaxations. DPCPX (10 nM) failed to antagonize the effect of CCPA, but inhibited per se NANC relaxations (range 0.1-100 nM). CCPA (10 nM-10 microM) contracted unstimulated tracheal preparations, an effect antagonized by 10 nM DPCPX, with a pK(B) value of 8.43. Cl-IB-MECA (10 nM-3 microM) inhibited NANC relaxations through a mechanism antagonized by MRS 1220 (100 nM). A(1)- and A(3)-positive neurons containing nNOS were detected in tracheal sections.
In all 4 E1A-expressing transfectants, expression of the E1A 243R protein was much higher than that of the 289R protein. LPS significantly increased IL-6 secretion in both E1A-positive and E1A-negative cells and no significant differences were found. Treatment with hydrocortisone at a physiological concentration clearly decreased LPS-induced IL-6 secretion, and this down-regulation effect could be abolished in the presence of TSA. LPS significantly decreased HDAC activity, which was completely abolished by application of hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone alone had no effect on HDAC activity in cells without LPS stimulation. There were no differences in HDAC activity or IL-6 secretion under these treatments between E1A-positive and E1A-negative cells.
Twenty-three articles (19 cohorts/case series and 4 case reports), involving 501 patients with airway stents, were included. The indication for airway stenting was malignancy and benign disease in 45 and 55% of the included patients, respectively. Ninety-three (19%) out of the 501 stented patients experienced SARTI. Pneumonia was the most common type of SARTI (47%), followed by bronchial infection (24%), cavitary pneumonia/lung abscess and intraluminal fungus ball. Staphylococcus aureus (39%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%) were the most commonly identified pathogens. Twenty-six (68%) out of the 38 patients with SARTI, for whom outcome data were available, died.
In close agreement with pathophysiological fundamentals, significant (p &lt; 0.001) increases in R0, Rm, and Z4Hz, and reductions in C(dyn) (p &lt; 0.003) were observed. S and Xm presented smaller modifications (p &lt; 0.02). All FOT parameters were significantly correlated with spirometric indices. Z4Hz was the most adequate parameter for clinical use (Se = 75%, Sp = 75%), followed by R0 and Rm.
The patients were divided into three groups: ages 20-44 (n = 254), ages 45-64 (n = 373), and ages 65-86 (n = 130). Body mass index (BMI) and the proportion of overweight patients (BMI &gt; or =25) were lower in the elderly group (ages 65-84) than in the other age groups (all p &lt; 0.01). However, in the elderly group, there was a significant correlation between AHI and BMI (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.01), and BMI was a significant determinant of AHI (beta = 0.30, p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the elderly group showed a high percentage of apneas among apneas and hypopneas ( p = 0.02) and increased duration of apnea-hypopnea (p &lt; 0.01) compared to the other age groups.
Of 47/50 (94%) respondents, self-efficacy significantly improved across all items (mean pre vs. post ratings, P &lt;.001). Housestaff were more prepared to manage patients on chronic opioid medication (2.8 vs. 3.8), including those with substance use disorders (2.3 vs. 3.4). They felt more prepared to identify opioid dependence (2.8 vs. 3.9) and overall rated the curriculum favorably (4.2).
Application of the RDA and GIF methods on data from the whole of Switzerland produced equivalent incidence trends. The GIF method revealed similar incidence trends in all of the Swiss cantons. Imputing a constant age of onset of 21 years resulted in almost equal trends to those obtained when real age of onset was used. The cantonal incidence estimates revealed that in the mid 80s there were high incidence rates in various regions distributed throughout all of the linguistic areas in Switzerland. During the following years these regional differences disappeared and the incidence of regular heroin use stabilized at a low level throughout the country.
The results found that the constructed EUTs with the first and the second method showed three-layered structures. The epithelial layer, stromal layer, and smooth muscle layer were stained by cytokeratin 18, vimentin, and alpha-actin, respectively. TEM showed that the cells in the EUTs reconstructed by the first method were attached to each other by apical tight junctions and rivet-like desmosomes. SEM showed protruded pinopodes, microvilli, and cilium of epithelial cells. The RT-PCR analysis showed that integrin beta3 subunit, HB-EGF, and HOXA-10 were expressed in EUTs. The coculture system of EUTs improved the development rate and quality of murine embryo significantly in comparison with those of control Chatot Ziomek Bavister culture. In the EUTs reconstructed by the second method, the epithelial cells demonstrated self-assembling ability and formed epithelial cell layer on top of the stromal layer and glandular tube-like structures in the stromal layer. Columnar epithelial cells existed in some parts of the epithelial layer.
Creating the disc/ring composites resulted in a significant increase in necrosis. ZVF significantly reduced necrosis and apoptosis at the wound edge. Nec-1 reduced necrosis. Both inhibitors reduced the level of wound-induced sulfated glycosaminoglycan loss. Toluidine blue staining and electron microscopy of cartilage revealed significant integration of the wound edges in disc/ring composites treated with ZVF. Nec-1 improved integration, but to a lesser extent. Push-out testing revealed that ZVF increased adhesive strength compared to control composites.
The tension induced by carbachol was dose-dependently reversed by the PDE inhibitors; the maximum reversal of tension ranged from 7% (tadalafil) to 34% (vardenafil). IHC revealed that the expression of PDE isoenzymes was limited to the smooth musculature of the detrusor. While there was prominent expression of PDE4 and PDE5, immunoreactions indicating the presence of PDE1 were less abundant.
The relevant diagnoses, medical procedures and German DRGs in the versions 2008 and 2009 were analysed based on the publications of the German DRG Institute (InEK) and the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI). Changes for 2009 focus on the development of the DRG structure, DRG validation and codes for medical procedures to be used for very complex cases. The outcome of these changes for German hospitals may vary depending in the range of activities.
Fifteen previously catheterized radial arteries (TRA group) were compared with 19 noncatheterized arteries (NCA group). The distal ends of the TRA group showed significantly more intimal hyperplasia (73.3% vs 21.1%; p = 0.03), periarterial tissue or fat necrosis (26% vs 0%; p = 0.02), and more adventitial inflammation (33.3% vs 0%; p = 0.01) than the distal ends of the NCA group. The distal ends of the TRA group also showed significantly more intimal hyperplasia (73.3% vs 26.6%; p = 0.03) and adventitial inflammation (33.3% vs 0%; p = 0.01) than the proximal ends of the same arteries. There were no histological differences in the proximal ends of the two groups.
Women with PCOS showed a higher LH to FSH ratio (p &lt; 0.01), increased fasting insulin (p &lt; 0.001), total testosterone (p &lt; 0.001), and androstenedione (p &lt; 0.001) levels, and lower SHBG concentrations (p &lt; 0.001) compared to control women. BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were also higher in women with PCOS (p &lt; 0.000 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Women with PCOS also showed increased total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), triglyceride (p &lt; 0.001), and apolipoprotein B (p &lt; 0.001) levels. Vascular data showed women with PCOS had a higher anteroposterior diameter than control women (p &lt; 0.005). However, when analysis of covariance was performed and BMI was entered into the model as a covariate, anteroposterior diameter did not maintain a significant association with PCOS.
Mice vaccinated with the recombinant Salmonella elicited both HIV-1-specific Th1 (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)) and Th2 (interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5)) cytokine responses. The vaccine induced 70 (IFN-gamma) spot-forming units (SFUs)/10e(6) splenocytes and 238 IL-4 SFUs/10e(6) splenocytes. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice also produced high levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines upon stimulation with a Gag CD4 peptide. The levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5 were 7.5-, 29.1-, 26.2- and 89.3-fold above the background, respectively. Both HIV-1 Gag-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were detected in the sera of vaccinated mice.
Results indicated that 69% of mothers had not been previously detected with major depression nor had they sought mental health treatment in the 12 months before the interview. The odds of having been previously diagnosed with major depression were significantly higher among White and single mothers, as well as among mothers with higher BMIs and those with a history of emotional problems. Nonimmigrant mothers without emotional problems had a higher odds of having seen a mental health specialist in the 12 months before the interview compared with immigrant mothers without emotional problems; no differences in mental health treatment were found between nonimmigrant and immigrant mothers with emotional problems. Finally, African-American mothers and those with a history of diabetes had significantly higher odds of seeing a primary care physician compared with Hispanic mothers and those with no history of diabetes, respectively.
Overall, 13.8% of Black women reported current depressive symptoms, and 14.9% reported a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive disorder by a health care provider. Significant correlates of both outcomes included rarely/never receiving social support, being unable to work, having physical health problems for 14 or more days in the past month, and dissatisfaction with life.
The majority of visits coded to IPV were for patients who presented with mild to moderate pain (86%), physical or sexual violence (50%), and injuries to the body (38%). The majority of patients in visits coded to IPV received radiologic testing, wound care, and pain medications (odds ratios [ORs], 1.6, 3.3, and 2.3 respectively). Disposition was mostly referral to another physician or clinic (42%) or return to the ED when needed (20%), but much less to nonphysician services such as social services, support services, and shelters (14%). Uninsured IPV patients were more likely to receive radiologic testing and pain medications (ORs 5.1 and 3, respectively). Patients seen by nurses were 9 times more likely to receive wound care.
During the 3-month follow-up period, 62% of participants used the home pregnancy test kit, which was approximately 3 times higher than the self-reported testing rate before the study (p &lt; .001). The most common reason for use was a late period (median 5 days late when test was done). Women also purchased additional kits to confirm the initial test result (median 2 kits per episode of use).
About 38% of Arkansas mothers of live singletons did not initiate breastfeeding. There was a greater representation of non-Hispanic Blacks among those who did not initiate breastfeeding (32%) than among those who initiated breastfeeding (9.9%). Among those who never breastfed, individual reasons were most frequently cited for noninitiation (63.0%). After adjusting for covariates, Hispanics had three times the odds of citing circumstances than Whites (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-7.18). Women who indicated that the hospital staff did not teach them how to breastfeed had more than two times greater odds of citing individual reasons (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.30-3.91) or reasons related to household responsibilities (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.19-4.36) as compared with women who indicated they were taught.
